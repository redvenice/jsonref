Her father missed her wedding. He missed walking her down the isle all because of that ill-conceived publicity stunt.    The 74-year-old eventually stopped by to see friends at an apartment complex in the Los Angeles neighborhood  He carried the items he had purchased from Best Buy into the friend\u0027s apartment and left them there when he left          Markle Sr. had left his home in Rosarito, Mexico on Tuesday night, the eve of his birthday, and drove the six hours in heavy traffic to check into a $130-a-night motel (above) in Los Angeles          He checked into the $130-a-night motel (above) in Los Angeles on Tuesday night after driving in heavy traffic for six hours\u0027It was really just such poor judgement on his part. Now everyone\u0027s feeling sorry for him. They shouldn\u0027t. He brought this upon himself and if he were truly sick Meghan would have made an effort to visit him. Don\u0027t feel sorry for him. If anything, feel sorry for Meghan.\u0027Since the wedding, Markle Sr. has given a number of paid media interviews speaking about his daughter and the royal family. The father-of-three recently revealed he isn\u0027t fazed by reports that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are fed up with him running to the media and he vowed to continue speaking about Meghan until he can be part of her life again.Who says you can\u0027t go home?

Among the items on display is a family photo of Charles holding his first grandchild, Prince George, with the Duke of Cambridge beside him. (To the right is an 18th century Japanese-style bureau cabinet)          One of the works which reflects the Prince\u0027s cultural side is this 18th century masterpiece The Tribuna of the Uffizi by Johan Joseph Zoffany. Considered the German artist\u0027s greatest painting, it depicts a group of aristocrats set against a backdrop of masterpieces. It was commissioned by Queen Charlotte in 1772, but she actually disliked the finished product. Zoffany was criticised for including too many figures, and according to one historical diary, the Queen \u0027would not suffer the picture to be placed in any of her apartments\u0027. Charles, however, is a fan of the intricate painting          Charles selected more than 100 pieces from private family paintings and photographs, major art from the Royal Collection and work by up-and-coming artists for the attraction - entitled Prince and Patron - which marks his 70th birthday year. Among the items above, a painting of Charles II is adjusted by a member of the Royal Collection Trust staff. On display are works from such masters as Holbein, Raphael, Rubens and Titian  In one section, painted oil sketches of William and Harry (above, right) by Nicola Philipps are hung next to watercolours painted by Charles in the 1990s on the Queen\u0027s private Balmoral estate. Below are marble busts of the prince\u0027s great-great-great-grandparents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who themselves were well-known art lovers. The piece in the centre is a sketch of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, circa 1841  One of the highlights of the exhibition is Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s red felt hooded cloak (left) - a stunning artefact the heir to the throne knows well from Windsor Castle, where it was on display for a number of years. The cloak was taken from Bonaparte\u0027s baggage train immediately after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and given to the future George IV by the Field Marshal who fought alongside the Duke of Wellington.

She replied: \u0027I\u0027m not going to adopt that choice of words\u0027.          In a wide-ranging news conference, Merkel described Germany\u0027s relationship with the United States as \u0027crucial\u0027, even after Trump (pictured) last week accused Berlin of being a \u0027captive\u0027 of Russia due to its energy relianceAsked about Trump\u0027s frequent attacks on Germany and her in particular, Merkel responded with deliberately measured calm, saying: \u0027I take note of it.\u0027Merkel told reporters during her annual summer news conference in Berlin that Trump\u0027s regular jibes at Germany \u0027certainly have something to do with our economic size.\u0027\u0027I try to address the criticism but also to provide an independent, confident answer, and this doesn\u0027t always match the view held by the American president.\u0027Addressing one of Trump\u0027s biggest complaints - that Berlin is exploiting the United States when it comes to trade - Merkel said that that narrative only takes into account the trade in goods. She said that when trade in services and repatriation of profits are taken into account, the figures favor the U.S.Merkel, now in her fourth term, said tit-for-tat tariffs imposed or threatened between the United States and China could cause collateral damage to German automakers such as BMW, which has its biggest plant in the U.S.\u0027We see these potential tariffs both as a breach of WTO rules and also as a danger to the prosperity of many in the world,\u0027 she said.Merkel said that trans-Atlantic cooperation, including with the president, is \u0027of course central for us and I will continue to nurture it,\u0027 adding that cooperation produces \u0027win-win\u0027 situations.Merkel, a conservative who grew up in Communist East Germany, welcomed Trump\u0027s invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet in Washington this autumn and said it should become normal again for US and Russian leaders to meet.But she added that she had been right to say a year ago that Europe could no longer rely on the United States to impose order on the world, and that it needed to take matters close to home into its own hands.\u0027We can\u0027t rely on the superpower of the United States,\u0027 Merkel said, describing possible U.S. tariffs on imported cars as \u0027a real threat to the prosperity of many in the world\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/06/4E6DBD1D00000578-5974727-The_property_near_Ascot_is_within_a_walled_plot_with_fields_arou-a-13_1532150730977.jpg","title":"Building work begins transform Prince Andrew Fergies former mansion LARGER home","story":"    This is the new mansion being built by a Kazakh billionaire who bought Prince Andrew\u0027s marital home and razed it to the ground          The property near Ascot is within a walled plot with fields around it also believed to have been included in the sale for security reasons          Nicknamed SouthYork because it resembled Southfork, the ranch-house in TV’s Dallas, the mansion completed in 1990 was left to rot much to the ire of locals who called it an eyesore  Kazakh businessman Timur Kulibayev paid £3million over the £12m asking price for Prince Andrew\u0027s marital home in 2007 despite it being on the market for five years          The Queen gave Andrew and Fergie the land to build on in 1986 when they married, and work started in 1987 (pictured) and took around three years to finishTwo years on new pictures reveal that the new 14-bedroom property is taking shape 31 years after Andrew and Fergie\u0027s own marital home was first built. The current owner, who owns a number of luxury properties in the UK, was granted planning permission to replace the former royal home with a larger house with six bedrooms for family and guests and eight bedrooms for staff.The new design includes a family living room, drawing room, formal dining room, study and sitting rooms for children and the master suite.A 25 metre indoor swimming pool to the south of the house to replace the current outdoor pool and the five acre plot has already been re-landscaped and will include a wild woodland area or orchard. Boris Johnson sparks fury by failing to move out of Foreign...Highland Estate which saw stunning Jacobite victory and...EXCLUSIVE: Inside Elle Macpherson’s new $8 million...Share this articleThe house it replaced was designed by Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, who also created a development on the Balmoral estate. ‘SouthYork’ was given to Andrew after his marriage in 1986. The Duchess of York lived on there with daughters Beatrice and Eugenie following the orce in 1996, but moved out in 2006 and joined Andrew at his home Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.It was sold a year later but has become an expensive ruin and worse it is now being bombarded by noisy Jumbo jets coming in to land at Heathrow after bosses at the airport switched the flight-path for incoming aircraft.  Sunninghill Park was originally part of Windsor Forest until 1630 and the mansion was built in around 1800.The house was the headquarters of the American Ninth Air Force from November 1943 to September 1944 before it was bought by the royal family Crown Estate and was planned to be given to the Queen and Prince Philip after their wedding in November 1947.But it was destroyed by a major fire and after Her Majesty became Queen it was untouched until Princess Margaret considered building there.  In 1986 it was sold to the Queen who then gifted it to her son Andrew when he married Sarah Ferguson that year and work started on their 12-bedroom home the following year.But within ten years their marriage was over and the house abandoned a decade after that.

She was born by IVF in 1978The world\u0027s first test tube baby has paid tribute to the \u0027forgotten\u0027 third in vitro fertilisation (IVF) pioneer who helped create her in a laboratory.Louise Brown, 39, was born at Oldham General Hospital on July 25, 1978 after her parents became the first people to successfully undergo IVF.Lesley and John\u0027s treatment paved the way for around eight million IVF births across the world to date.It involves the extraction of mature eggs from the woman\u0027s ovaries which are then fertilised by sperm in a lab and implanted back into the uterus. Now Louise wants the contribution of Jean Purdy, the world\u0027s first embryologist who helped bring her to life,  to be given greater recognition for her pioneering work.Purdy, who died in 1985 aged 39, was the first person to witness the successful cell ision of the embryo that would become Louise.The silent hero of the groundbreaking treatment worked alongside two widely credited IVF researchers: gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe and physiologist Robert Edwards.She trained as a nurse at Addenbrooke\u0027s Hospital in Cambridge and was just 23 when she was recruited by Edwards, initially as a lab technician.

He is a very happy little boy.’William and Kate hope their choice of school, albeit one in the heart of an affluent area of the capital that has been dubbed Nappy Valley, will offer their son the chance to develop in a more rounded environment than other young royals.‘They thought long and hard about where George should be educated and really liked Thomas’s, which has a lovely nurturing atmosphere,’ a source said.‘The school focuses as much on helping develop the character of pupils, as what they learn. William and Kate are keen to allow George to spread his wings and make friends at this stage.‘They know there will come a time when they will have to sit down and talk to him about the implications of his royal status and why so many people are interested in him. He is becoming more aware of the cameras. But they are determined to do that at George’s own pace and feel that can all wait a bit.’          Prince William with Prince George on his son\u0027s first day of school on September 7, 2017Carole, 63, and her husband Michael, 69, play a hugely significant role in their grandchildren’s lives — as their current Caribbean holiday together shows. She has taken George and Charlotte to work at the family’s Party Pieces HQ, a short drive from the Middletons’ Berkshire mansion, where they play at being shopkeepers.One visitor spotted George sitting in the ‘front of house’, exclaiming excitedly ‘Oh my gosh!’ as his indulgent granny gave him a bag of sweets for being a good boy.Kate understands only too well that it is a grandparent’s prerogative to spoil their grandchildren — and still laughs about how she once called home from a foreign tour to speak to her mother, who was looking after George, only for him to tell her earnestly that his granny had given him ‘chips, again’ for dinner.With a loving, extended family around him, determined to protect him from the pressures of royal life for as long as they possibly can, it’s no wonder that George is growing into such a settled little boy.And who knows, one day he still may be able to become a pilot — just like Papa. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/00/4E6D547000000578-0-image-a-61_1532128228400.jpg","title":"Six mothers girl holidays abroad flock flamingo themed outfits","story":"    Birds of a feather: The group of married mothers from Essex have adopted the pink birds as their emblem ever since a trip to Ibiza in 2011          Flocking together: Other flamingo-inspired items have included the sunglasses they are wearing in the latest picture, along with bikinis and many different topsOther flamingo-inspired items have included the sunglasses they are wearing in the latest picture, along with bikinis and many different tops.Mother-of-two Tracey Hayes-Burt, 46, a company director from Ardleigh, said: ‘We are known as the flamingos in our home town.’She added: ‘We’ve known each other for more than 30 years.

In fact, he had quit the course.He also posted a CV online which claimed he had more than 46 years’ experience as a doctor, despite then being aged only 41. The GP also made claims on his social media account profiles that he had studied at a university in New York – only later to admit he simply visited their library.He also boasted of having an article published in the Journal of Gastroentology, yet no evidence was ever found and it was deemed ‘entirely fictitious’.He even claimed to be a fellow of the American Association of Aesthetic Surgeons – but no such organisation exists.Now Samin, of Llandudno, North Wales, has been struck off the medical register after a week-long tribunal in Manchester.MPTS panel chairman Damian Cooper said Samin’s conduct undermined patients’ trust in doctors and brought the medical profession into disrepute.Share this articleMr Cooper said: ‘The tribunal determines that Dr Samin has been persistently dishonest and has demonstrated no insight into the seriousness of his actions and their consequences.‘Dr Samin’s actions have the potential for an adverse impact on the standing and perception of the regulatory process and the medical profession as a whole.‘The tribunal is concerned that it has had no evidence to show that Dr Samin has reflected on the events at all.‘The tribunal therefore concludes that it is necessary in the public interest to direct that Dr Samin’s name be erased from the Medical Register.‘In the light of all the evidence presented to it, the tribunal is satisfied that erasure is the necessary, proportionate and appropriate sanction.’ Dr Samin, who qualified as a doctor at Peshawar University in Pakistan in 2001, has been given 28 days to appeal against the decision.It comes after he appeared at Mold Crown Court last year when he admitted forging his doctor wife’s signature on a house sale document. He pleaded guilty to two charges and was given a 12-month community order and told to pay £535 costs.Samin, who had previously worked at Four Seasons Medical Centre in Orford, Warrington, Cheshire, then faced a GMC inquiry. In November last year, an initial MPTS tribunal banned him from the profession for four months after ruling that his fitness to practise was impaired.That first panel accepted Dr Samin’s evidence that his dishonesty was ‘not persistent’ and ‘it was a one-off incident’.However, a review tribunal held this year dug deeper into his professional qualifications and online boasts and uncovered a series of blatant lies.This month’s tribunal, held in Samin’s absence, heard how he had given misleading and false information to the first hearing last year.It added that his dishonesty had been ‘persistent, repeated and over a long period of time’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/21/4E69948D00000578-0-image-m-55_1532033734376.jpg","title":"EXTRAORDINARY LIVES nurse mothers true mettle shone Iron Lady Cleethorpes","story":"    Sheila Jones was desperate to get involved in the war effort and was always adventurousShe started off nursing, but her talents were soon spotted, and she became one of those responsible for receiving Morse code messages from British Agents dropped over Japanese lines.At one point, Mum and another girl, Molly, were in contact with about eight agents each, could recognise each one by their inidual style of tapping out Morse, and were the only two people who knew where all the agents were in enemy territory.It was a dangerous job, but Mum loved it.

He was just a toddler when his mother died on the day World War II started, and with his father on active service and later held in a prisoner of war camp, he was raised by his grandmother and maternal aunt in Kirton, Lincolnshire.They expected him to work for his keep, even as a youngster, and he put in long hours in their market garden, despite suffering badly from asthma that blighted him most of his life. It stood him in good stead, though, because it inspired a love of gardening which ultimately became his career.It’s a job that took him all over Britain and led to the occasional brush with celebrity and royalty. One of his claims to fame was that for six months he worked on the garden of Simon Cowell’s parents, Eric and Julie, at their home in Elstree, Hertfordshire.          Keith Beatrice Biggadyke\u0027s job as a gardener took him all over Britain and led to the occasional brush with celebrities and royaltyOn more than one occasion he took young Simon and his younger brother, Nicholas, to school. Simon was a nice boy by all accounts, and Keith might have got to know him better had not Eric, after one too many festive drinks, given him time off at Christmas — without his wife’s permission.Julie was so displeased when Keith didn’t turn up that week that she fired him.Simon’s rise to fame and fortune tickled him greatly.Keith also liked to joke that he could boast royal approval after his work on the municipal gardens in Broseley, Shropshire, received compliments from Prince Charles when he visited. He was delighted about that.Keith was in his 40s and newly orced when I met him at a dance class in North London in 1978. I was instantly smitten with his twinkling eyes and beautiful smile. As I got to know him, I discovered his good looks were matched by a wonderful, caring personality: Keith would help anyone, and if he couldn’t, he’d find someone else who could.He told me that he had two ‘birthdays’ every year because, as a young boy he’d marked his birthday on September 21. But when he finally laid eyes on his birth certificate, he discovered that his official birth date was the following day, so he decided to celebrate twice. ‘Why not?’ was his attitude.We married in 1987 and, along with our beloved Westies, Mac and Frazer, I happily followed him wherever his gardening work took him.Eventually, we moved back to his home county, where Keith’s final working years were spent in the grounds of Fulbeck Hall, that had been the home of the Fane family since the 17th century.In 2002, Keith was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but was determined to carry on living life the best he could and survived another 14 years. He passed away at home with me at his bedside after signing a form saying he did not want any further treatment. I miss him terribly, as do many people.

John Lennon went to Quarry Bank School, and my friends and I used to see him play in his first band, The Quarrymen. Little did we know!Mike swept me off my feet. It helped that he had a car, which was unusual for a young man at the time. He was apprenticed to a watchmaker, so he earned a decent wage.          Mrs Jean Pepper, wife of Mike Pepper, a watchmaker from Liverpool, whose clients included the BeatlesHis dad had been a watchmaker before him, so maybe it was in the blood. He never lost his fascination with watches.We married in 1960 and when Mike returned from National Service at RAF Waddington, Lincs, he started work with his father at Liverpool jeweller Boodle and Dunthorne.Later, he set up his own watch repair business, and had a shop in Pensby on the Wirral. He loved his job, especially then, when repairing a watch was an art. He’d be in his element lining up all the pieces, cleaning them and getting the watch going again. He would say it was like solving a mystery.It’s odd because he wasn’t that practical when it came to DIY — I don’t think he could put a nail in the wall straight — but he was a whizz with watches.He thought it was a sad day when everything became battery-run and fixing a watch just meant replacing a whole unit.People used to ask him about clocks, too, but he’d always patiently explain that clocks are very different. He was a watch man!We had three children, a boy and two girls, and five grandchildren and a great-grandson. At one point I think he hoped our son would go into the watch business, too, but he also felt very strongly that each generation should do what they wanted to do.Mike was so proud of our family and all they achieved. He was a mad Liverpool fan, so when one of our grandsons, Conor Pepper, became a professional footballer, he was beside himself. Conor played for Inverness and Greenock Morton. His grandad would be cheering loudest of anyone on the pitch.Age 74, Mike was diagnosed with mouth cancer. He was determined to beat it and underwent a 16-hour operation. But the cancer came back.He was a popular man, and very special. Hundreds of people came to his funeral to give him the send off he deserved.And his own watch? It was an Omega, and it has gone to our son, who will treasure it and all it represents.  Robert Mike Pepper, born April 2, 1938, died May 14, 2017, aged 79.   Disabled and just 4ft tall... but Ruth had a gigantic personality My sister Ruth by Frances WadsworthWhen Ruth was born on August 30, 1951, doctors told our parents their second child was a ‘Mongol’ who would be severely disabled, have little or no quality of life and they should ‘put her in a home’.Our parents rejected this brutal advice, thank goodness.Ruth was just over 4ft, but had the biggest personality and a wicked sense of fun. She was a shrewd judge of people. She never suffered fools or those who patronised her, and could cut anyone down to size if she felt they needed it.          When Ruth, pictured with her sister Frances,  was born on August 30, 1951, doctors told her parents their second child was a ‘Mongol’She was also very perceptive and knew immediately if any of us — her three ‘sissers’, Jane, Bridget and me, or her adored nieces and nephews — were sad.We now know, of course, that Ruth had Down’s syndrome, but back then little was known about it. Our parents coped as best they could.Ruth attended special schools and training centres, but lived at home.When our father retired from the Civil Service, he took on government advisory roles abroad, in Borneo, then Hong Kong, Nigeria and lastly the Seychelles. Ruth and our mum went, too.Ruth took it in her stride. Very little fazed her — not even the snake wrapped around a lavatory in Borneo. And she coped brilliantly when the family returned to settle in Bath.After our father’s death in 1984, she lived with Mum in Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, where her life was a whirl of discos, riding for the disabled, cinema trips and excursions with Fiveways Day Centre and carers in Yeovil.When our mum, Jean, died, aged 95, in 2013, we worried how Ruth would cope. But we needn’t have worried.As part of the NHS Shared Lives Scheme, she moved in with a wonderful carer, Marilyn Saunders, and two other Down’s adults, John and Sarah, plus two parrots, a chicken, four Alpacas and two little dogs.Ill health struck Ruth at the end of 2017, and she died peacefully at home with us all at her bedside.Ruth brought happiness to all who knew her. She taught us how to love life, appreciate what really mattered, and to find laughter in everything. We miss her so much.Ruth Victoria Wadsworth, born, August 30, 1951, died November 4, 2017, aged 66."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/21/4E71E9C100000578-5975537-image-m-7_1532119189937.jpg","title":"Acrocat Flexible feline opens living room door swinging handle","story":"    Momo can be seen dangling from the door handle after opening it himself within seconds          He casually struts through the doorway after performing the stunt to perfection at home in SpainOwner Mar Villanueva, from Spain, took Momo into her home when the original owners could no longer care for him was left stunned by his stunts.She said: \u0027He like many other kittens was an impulsive purchase of a couple, but the people who bought him soon realised that they did not have time for him, when he arrived my home he was less than a year old.\u0027I don\u0027t know exactly how he lived in his original home, but when he came to ours he was not able to jump so I imagine they had him locked up.Pet owner faces hostile backlash after placing his cat Uma...Panther or pet?

But friends insist he is no different from other young children. ‘Just because he reacts more cautiously than Charlotte when there is a camera around isn’t an indication of what he is like behind closed doors,’ says one. ‘Your first day at school is a big enough deal without all these strange people watching you. He is a very happy little boy.’William and Kate hope their choice of school, albeit one in the heart of an affluent area of the capital that has been dubbed Nappy Valley, will offer their son the chance to develop in a more rounded environment than other young royals.‘They thought long and hard about where George should be educated and really liked Thomas’s, which has a lovely nurturing atmosphere,’ a source said.‘The school focuses as much on helping develop the character of pupils, as what they learn. William and Kate are keen to allow George to spread his wings and make friends at this stage.‘They know there will come a time when they will have to sit down and talk to him about the implications of his royal status and why so many people are interested in him. He is becoming more aware of the cameras.

In fact, he had quit the course.He also posted a CV online which claimed he had more than 46 years’ experience as a doctor, despite then being aged only 41. The GP also made claims on his social media account profiles that he had studied at a university in New York – only later to admit he simply visited their library.He also boasted of having an article published in the Journal of Gastroentology, yet no evidence was ever found and it was deemed ‘entirely fictitious’.He even claimed to be a fellow of the American Association of Aesthetic Surgeons – but no such organisation exists.Now Samin, of Llandudno, North Wales, has been struck off the medical register after a week-long tribunal in Manchester.MPTS panel chairman Damian Cooper said Samin’s conduct undermined patients’ trust in doctors and brought the medical profession into disrepute.Share this articleMr Cooper said: ‘The tribunal determines that Dr Samin has been persistently dishonest and has demonstrated no insight into the seriousness of his actions and their consequences.‘Dr Samin’s actions have the potential for an adverse impact on the standing and perception of the regulatory process and the medical profession as a whole.‘The tribunal is concerned that it has had no evidence to show that Dr Samin has reflected on the events at all.‘The tribunal therefore concludes that it is necessary in the public interest to direct that Dr Samin’s name be erased from the Medical Register.‘In the light of all the evidence presented to it, the tribunal is satisfied that erasure is the necessary, proportionate and appropriate sanction.’ Dr Samin, who qualified as a doctor at Peshawar University in Pakistan in 2001, has been given 28 days to appeal against the decision.It comes after he appeared at Mold Crown Court last year when he admitted forging his doctor wife’s signature on a house sale document. He pleaded guilty to two charges and was given a 12-month community order and told to pay £535 costs.Samin, who had previously worked at Four Seasons Medical Centre in Orford, Warrington, Cheshire, then faced a GMC inquiry. In November last year, an initial MPTS tribunal banned him from the profession for four months after ruling that his fitness to practise was impaired.That first panel accepted Dr Samin’s evidence that his dishonesty was ‘not persistent’ and ‘it was a one-off incident’.However, a review tribunal held this year dug deeper into his professional qualifications and online boasts and uncovered a series of blatant lies.This month’s tribunal, held in Samin’s absence, heard how he had given misleading and false information to the first hearing last year.It added that his dishonesty had been ‘persistent, repeated and over a long period of time’. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37c0a58456e3f92e1ab67b0ef50dac1b94cff3ad/1208_460_3574_2144/master/3574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d025bda4e7630f83d1139a304bb7c9","title":"streets in the sky the sheffield high rises that were home sweet home love among ruins","story":"Rollerskating paper girls, daredevil sunbathers, high altitude milkmen … a new photography show beautifully captures the first and last days of a Sheffield estate and its residentsBill Stephenson had been trying to photograph the residents of one of Sheffield’s most notorious housing estates for some time when he realised he was going about things all wrong. No one trusted him, this outsider with a southern accent and a fancy camera, parachuting in from the city’s leafy Nether Edge area. They didn’t appreciate him hanging around Hyde Park flats, snatching photographs of them as they went about their lives amid the brutalist concrete they called home, perched on the hill above Sheffield railway station.He started to leave his posh Billingham bag at home. His Hasselblad, worth thousands, went in a carrier bag with a towel at the bottom to protect it. Sometimes he never even took it out. “Often I’d go up there and not take any pictures,” he says. “I’d just sit on a bench and smoke and chat to people, go for coffee at the drop-in centre. There’s always someone on an estate who knows everyone, so I found that person and got them to introduce me to everyone else.”It was 1988 and Hyde Park was set for demolition. Barely 20 years after its construction, residents were about to be scattered across Sheffield’s seven hills. It was a sad ending for what had been – along with its sister development, Park Hill – the ultimate symbol of Sheffield council’s pioneering postwar vision for social housing.It would have been easy, says Stephenson, to have just done “alienation” photography: “You just get someone standing in this brutal concrete environment with the building towering over them and the wind whistling around them.” The flats have often been depicted as a brutalist nightmare: director Shane Meadows used Park Hill as the home of his This Is England ’90 characters when they started smoking heroin.But Stephenson didn’t want to go down that road. The people he met, wandering around with his carrier bag and its precious cargo, loved living in Hyde Park. Yes, times were tough, with many residents unemployed after the closure of the pits and the steelworks. But they were proud of their community and didn’t want to move. He set about photographing them at home, sunbathing on the balconies, playing snooker at the youth club and canoodling in the doorways. There are bubble perms and stonewashed denim, knee socks and white stilettos, Saturday night gladrags and grubby playclothes. One particularly pleasing image shows Sue, a community linchpin and owner of the estate’s shop, stacking Nice’n Easy hair dye in her overalls. Her slightly raised eyebrows seem a warning to anyone who asked for credit – known locally as “strap”, as in “strapped for cash” – and didn’t pay it back. She’d name and shame them, Stephenson recalls, using cards placed in her shop window. Another afternoon he caught two girls, Anita and Emma, looking fed-up as they delivered newspapers in their rollerboots and school skirts.It wasn’t strict documentary photography. Most of the images are posed. Stephenson calls them “semi-formal”. He didn’t manipulate his subjects or get them to do anything they weren’t already doing, but he had their permission to shoot and they had a veto on their photos being made public.His favourite image was of a strapping young black lad known locally as Tony the Ton, who was mucking about with his eight-year-old nephew, Martin. Both are topless: Tony in red tracksuit bottoms and Martin in little grey shorts, his knees knocked together as he mirrored his uncle’s crossed arms. “I was just there talking to them and captured the moment,” says Stephenson. “They didn’t feel threatened by me.”Many of the pictures show what had become a very mixed community. One captures a teenage couple, Faisal and Paula, their arms entwined outside the service lift. He is wearing Joe Bloggs jeans with transfers on them, she is in baggy denim and an argyle sweater. He looks Asian, she is white – and seems shyly delighted to have bagged a boyfriend.Stephenson admits to seeking out these relationships. “At the time,” he says, “there had been a series of race riots across the UK and the press liked to talk a lot about racial tension, which I didn’t think told the whole story at all. What I saw at Hyde Park was a community that integrated beautifully.”The resulting pictures featured in a show at Sheffield’s Untitled gallery in 1988 and then toured nationally. Thirty years on, Stephenson’s pictures are about to go on display again, this time only a few minutes away from where they were taken. S1 Artspace, a gallery and collection of artists’ studios, has relocated from the city centre to the old residents’ garage behind Park Hill, which was listed by English Heritage in 1998 and is midway through a massive regeneration project by developers Urban Splash.S1 Artspace reopens in its new home today with Love Among the Ruins, a show that juxtaposes Stephenson’s pictures of Hyde Park with shots taken by another social documentary photographer, Roger Mayne, between 1961 and 1965. Mayne had been commissioned to show the early days of Park Hill, when it was the place everyone wanted to live – and before the Corbusier-inspired walkways designed for milkfloats had become a convenient escape route for ne’er-do-wells doing drug runs on their bikes.His images show the utopian vision of the architects, Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith, who had been tasked with solving the city’s housing and health crises by creating high-rise communities that would enjoy the same amenities as traditional neighbourhoods. The striking difference between Mayne and Stephenson’s images is the gender mix. In the 1960s, Park Hill appeared almost entirely populated by women. Bundled up in overcoats, curlers visible under head scarves, they went to the bingo and bossed the kids around while the men were out at work.By the time Stephenson arrived, the men were unemployed and the council considered Hyde Park flats a failed experiment in social housing. Shortly after he took his final frame, the bulldozers were sent in. He has kept in touch with many residents. One, Donna Hargreaves, contacted him recently after seeing a photograph of herself that was used to advertise the S1 show in the Sheffield Star. He captured her as a 14-year-old, straddling the fourth floor concrete balcony in white shorts and a red and white striped T-shirt with her friend Carmen. Now in her mid-40s, she planned to attend this week’s opening.Others did not make it into middle age. One boy took his own life a girl died after a life of health problems. For some, being photographed was a confidence boost. Leroy, whom Stephenson photographed on the Hyde Park swings as a 14-year-old, contacted him recently. “He said, ‘I was amazed you wanted to photograph me. People like me were invisible then: black teenagers living on a housing estate like Hyde Park.’ He’s doing really well now and has a great job as an IT guy.”Life changed for Stephenson too. He started a family and, unable to make ends meet doing social documentary photography, began taking commercial work: weddings on Saturdays, TV work and PR gigs that never made his heart sing. But he will forever be proud of the eight months he spent traipsing around Hyde Park with his camera in a carrier bag."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78e4c12eed8d8b8f1014a46c869a61787f291e39/654_757_5943_3566/master/5943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a2a1f48ae21b32f518f6acb4aaba2f3","title":"chuck palahniuk interview adjustment day black ethno state gay parenting incel movement","story":"The American novelist talks about extremism, learning about failure from Brad Pitt, the power of protest – and why losing nearly all his money has been ‘kind of nice’First his father-in-law died of cancer. Then came the suspicion that his income for the last few years had been embezzled by an accountant at his literary agency. And to top off Chuck Palahniuk’s 2018 so far, there was the death of Anthony Bourdain – fondly remembered by Palahniuk for a TV show they made together in 2007, doing a gastronomic tour of the novelist’s hometown, Portland, Oregon. “It’s been a spring to remember,” he murmurs.I’d idly assumed that the author of Fight Club, Choke and other vivid studies of all kinds of American violence would be an expansive raconteur, maybe even a bit boorish and alpha. But sitting in the lofty space where he teaches writing in Portland, he is gentle and thoughtful, choosing his words carefully. “It’s looking like my payment for at least my last two – perhaps four – books has been taken, and so that leaves me with no reserves to write the next book,” he says. “Money seems to have been taken over such a long period that they haven’t even established yet how much was taken, and from what accounts.” Palahniuk says the accountant, Darin Webb, would lie, telling him that the publisher hadn’t made the cash available, or that he was preoccupied with caring for his mother who has Alzheimer’s. Webb was charged with fraud in May. Depending on the terms of his next book deal, and on how much money is recovered in a settlement, Palahniuk may have to sell his house to stay afloat.What does it feel like, suddenly being so financially precarious? There’s a long, silent look down. “It’s kind of nice,” he decides. “Writing was initially my way of saving money, because if you’re writing, you’re not spending. So it throws me back into writing. There are larger issues in life – the embezzlement is dwarfed by my father-in-law’s death. And there’s the awareness that I’m the person who got me to this place, and I’m still that person, so I can still turn it all back around, and come up with something really strong and vibrant and interesting.”He has already done so with his latest novel, Adjustment Day, a satirical fantasy in which, threatened with a new war draft, American society is overturned via an armed insurrection. As in Fight Club in 1996, there’s a band of disfranchised men who find brotherhood and identity in violence. It also shares that book’s moments of body horror: maggots devouring a dead man’s face a gross-out moment with a catheter. “I include those scenes so it’s not just an exploration of emotions and intellect,” he says. “It’s really rare that art affects us on a corporeal level – on a physical, gut level.”But Palahniuk moves on to fresh ground, too. Following the uprising, the US self-segregates into white and black ethno-states, Caucasia and Blacktopia, while gays and lesbians of all ethnicities take over California, renaming it Gaysia. The redrawn map is the starting point for an analysis of race, sexuality, class and nationality, with a few love stories chucked in between the bulging cast of characters. Credibility is stretched – at one point a voice on a radio announces “the joy of fiction is that it only has to smell true” – but the book remains rooted in real-world ructions.“Very little of what I do is invention – most of what I do is journalism,” he says. Doing research for the novel, he interviewed groups already advocating for American ethno-states, including the white American Renaissance. And California could break into three states following a referendum vote in November. Palahniuk sees Americans as being “out of love with a narrative of one great rainbow, and everyone being homogenised and allowed to live within this system”. His own experience growing up in the 1970s in the nearly all-white town of Burbank, Washington, was that “we still had a great deal of domestic violence and crime and suicide. I never bought the idea that a white ethno-state would be a Disneyland fantasy. But I am fascinated by the idea that isolation is the only thing that might allow us to create something new. Culture is developed in isolation, and what I’m wondering is whether in this very wired world, there won’t be a return to that isolation.” Journalists, incidentally, are among the most victimised characters in the book: the Adjustment Day uprising of the title is brought about by a social media poll of the least popular people in society, and journalists are some of the first against the wall. “I think Americans are realising that journalism is so partisan now,” he says. “They’re sick of that.”After Adjustment Day, Blacktopia quickly becomes a kind of Wakandan paradise, full of pyramid-shaped spaceships. “I have no standing or authority to say anything unflattering about the black ethno-state,” he says. “I’m white, so I could make the whites total dolts I’m gay so I can trash the gays.”Gaysia, then, doesn’t fare so well. Gay people who want to emigrate there when they reach adulthood can only do so if there is a straight equivalent wanting to emigrate from Gaysia, and the imbalance leads to thousands trapped in limbo, working in labour camps. It plays with what Palahniuk sees as a fixation on parenthood in the gay community. “There’s no art or music in Gaysia – all expression is the expression of having children. So much culture was created by gay people because they were trained to be observant, because everything that kept them alive was from observing how straight people were, and aping and mimicking those ways of being, so they would not be destroyed. They then used those skills of observation to execute beautiful things that served the overall culture. But having kids is a full-time job – it doesn’t leave you a lot of time to be a sculptor. I and a lot of people in my generation, an older generation, felt that gay people were having children as a means of expression, and giving up this incredible heritage of artistic expression.” Caucasia, meanwhile, becomes a feudal system in thrall to the beefy overlords who brought about Adjustment Day: an incel fantasy where women are utterly subordinated (at least for a while). I tell Palahniuk that I’ve seen incels – “involuntary celibate” men angry at their lack of sexual partners – quoting Fight Club as an example of why one shouldn’t underestimate ordinary frustrated men. He is amused, saying that the book was previously quoted by adherents to The Game, Neil Strauss’s guide to picking up women for emotionally unattached sex.“It’s fascinating that the group that can’t get laid is now adopting the same language. It shows how few options men have in terms of metaphors: a skimpy inventory of images. They have The Matrix – there’s a lot of red pill, blue pill stuff – and they have Fight Club. The only other thing is Dead Poets Society, where men go into a cavern and say poems to each other, and they’re not going to adopt that.” Women, he says, have more literature about female social structures, the likes of The Joy Luck Club or How to Make an American Quilt. “Those have a script and roles and determined ways of being, that women can adopt in order to be together long enough to share their lives.” Don’t men have sports or the pub, instead? “Those social groups don’t produce the memes and one-liners and metaphors.” Palahniuk doesn’t see Fight Club as particularly gendered anyway. “It was more about the terror that you were going to live or die without understanding anything important about yourself.”Where does he see the incel movement going? “It might be comparable to Valerie Solanas’s Society for Cutting Up Men, these very extreme feminist movements,” he says. “The extreme always goes away.” What about the recent clashes between the “alt-right” and the Antifa (antifascist) movement, disruption that feels part of the fabric of Adjustment Day? “This is just my gut reaction: we saw very little protest during the two Obama terms, largely because people were reluctant to protest anything when we had our first black president, for fear of being judged as racist, regardless of the issue. So we’ve had this pent-up need for protest, because protest is a way to discover one’s power and potential in the world, to do battle against something, and” – aside from Ferguson, Missouri, and the “quiet protest” of the Occupy movement – “we haven’t been able to do battle against the government for eight years.“My generation drew an enormous amount of strength from battling against Reagan and Thatcher,” he continues. “They were the perfect white parents for us to rail against, and helped develop a sense of ourselves as a generation. And Trump is white, straight, a combination of Margaret Thatcher’s hair and Ronald Reagan’s body – he’s the perfect guy to rail against.” Adjustment Day has several narrators, so it’s uncertain where Palahniuk’s own sentiments lie. To some, then, he will seem a mere provocateur, or even a troll, but in an age of dogmatism, there’s something refreshing about his poker face. “If I write something really didactic, it’s resolved, it’s gone,” he says. “But if I write something that people can really argue about, that thing is going to be in the culture for ever. For example: is Fight Club good or bad? It’s consensual, but it’s violence. I’m trying to create this dazzling spectacle that’s not meant to perpetuate or generate anything, but to be a sorbet that allows you to taste the next thing. To be a little more present in the next thing.” You don’t want to see resolution? “No. Especially in creative work, resolution is death.” Given his year so far, it’s a credo that he needs to believe in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d598d12d0659bf549d31aabccf7ad3df42ecf163/9_183_4895_2937/master/4895.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f065f40a5973315f80fc5459674b136","title":"full gas how to win a bike race tactics from inside the peloton peter cossins review","story":"A cycling journalist turns his gaze on the puzzles of the peloton, and falls back in love with the sportThe Tour de France, which finishes in Paris next weekend, attracts more than 10 million spectators to line its near 3,500km route, uniquely comprehensive press coverage for the sport and a TV and online audience estimated to be in the billions. Yet only a tiny fraction of those watching will have the first clue as to what is actually going on.Yes, there are obviously winners of the 21 stages, and an overall champion is crowned when they reach the Champs-Élysées. But in a peloton of 180 riders, operating in a seemingly chaotic working environment best described as like being inside a washing machine, very few are attempting to win. The vast majority are implementing a dizzyingly fluid set of agendas and allegiances that can combine – often in the same rider in the same race – team and personal ambitions, altruism and blatant commercialism, high courage and low cunning. In what is quite a brave admission for a cycling journalist, Peter Cossins admits early on in this breezy, enlightening book that even for someone who has reported on the sport for quarter of a century, what actually happens between flag and finish can often be close to “incomprehensible”.Cossins traces a long arc from the pioneer 19th-century racers who started out at a sprint and only slowed down as exhaustion struck, resulting in gaps of hours between riders, to today’s stars whose obsessive husbanding of energy results in three-week races being won by a matter of seconds. Along the way he pays tribute to the great riders and their tactical innovations: raising the tempo on a climb, deploying teammates to attack rivals, raising tempo approaching a climb, attacking on descents. Fausto Coppi, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Miguel Induráin and, most recently, Chris Froome and Team Sky have all applied their tweaks to a story that is more evolution than revolution.The takeaway message is that the strongest riders win not just because of their talents, but because of their ability to adapt tactics to maximise their advantages as well. Yet there is scope for lesser riders to have their moments, too. Cossins dissects the tactical thinking behind sprinting and climbing, dealing with the wind and life at the back of a race in the gruppetto. Doping and other dark deeds are also covered. But the star of the book emerges in his section on the breakaway. A feature of most races, the breakaway looks like, and often is, simply a way for a small team to get some TV exposure or a speculative punt by riders who feel strong on the day. But when a breakaway includes Belgian strongman Thomas De Gendt, it can become a much richer and more complex affair.De Gendt talks Cossins through the 19th stage of last year’s Vuelta a España, during which he delivered a masterclass in his chosen art. He combined years of experience and detailed intelligence gathering – about courses, the state of a race, the strengths of other riders – with rapid decision-making on the road to pull off a famous victory. Too often, Cossins says, a breakaway success is seen as a matter of luck on a day when the chasing peloton was either incompetent or uninterested in catching them. De Gendt’s “craft and knowhow … illustrates the falseness of that assumption”. (Not that tactical nous is everything: De Gendt also appears to possess the durable power of a tractor engine and a capacity to soak up pain that would make the Marquis de Sade wince. Head and legs!)Cossins suggests the best place to observe tactics in action today is in women’s racing. While the levels of skill and professionalism have vastly improved in recent years, budgets haven’t caught up, resulting in small teams that can’t afford the specialisation of the men’s sport. This has prompted riders to acquire wide skill sets and an ability to constantly adapt their style to different modes of racing.When looking back on his year watching the process of a race, rather than just its outcome, Cossins says he not only fell back in love with the sport, but also discovered the “full scope of its beauty for the first time”. To add to the poker and chess analogies, there is also an appropriate old literary adage in the sport: a good bike race might be an interesting whodunit, but it might be an even more interesting howdunnit.• Full Gas is published by Yellow Jersey.

Faced with falling sales and government pressure, though, she finds the attention to her gender a distraction by  Dominic Rushe. Photographs by Christopher LaneThe Fearless Girl is on the move. The bronze sculpture of a little girl defiantly facing off against Wall Street’s Charging Bull launched a million selfies and became an unlikely avatar of the #MeToo movement. Soon it will be transported a few hundred metres down the road in downtown Manhattan to confront another symbol of entrenched masculinity: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Stacey Cunningham says she couldn’t be more delighted.“I think she’s fantastic,” says Cunningham, the 67th president of the NYSE and the first woman to head the male-dominated institution in its 226-year history. “For me, she is a message to iniduals, though. I think we need to call ourselves to action, especially as women, not to hold ourselves back.”Cunningham may be a fan of Fearless Girl, but she is not as happy with the gender-focused attention drawn by her elevation to one of the most high-profile jobs in finance. She gives a small, hard smile when asked about the coverage.She should not really be surprised. The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US’s top 500 companies – many listed on the NYSE – fell this year.The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest. It is less male than it has been in the past, but that is because the number of men has been hacked away by technology, not ersity. The majority of the women on the exchange’s floor seem to be working for the 30-plus media outlets based there.Cunningham, 43, has been at the exchange on and off (and mostly on) since the 1990s. She says her surprise at the attention her appointment has brought may be because, in retrospect, she has always been gender-blind.“I always liked maths, science and problem-solving, so I gravitated towards engineering,” says Cunningham, who grew up in New Jersey, the fourth child of six, three boys, three girls. (“I’m the well-adjusted middle child,” she says.) She says she is disappointed that more girls don’t go into science and maths, but in her own case it was the obvious choice: “I didn’t think about that at all.”She must have had to tune out a lot. She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. “I walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,” she says. The “energy and the pace” reminded her of her family. “What struck me right away was the sense of community.”After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange’s chief operating officer in 2015.She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men’s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area.But she never experienced the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about, she says. “When you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,” she says. But she says she never experienced any behaviour that made her uncomfortable.“In my experience, if I said to somebody: ‘Hey, that’s not OK, too much,’ and I said it with a smile, too, then they knew,” she says, giving that tight little smile again. “Whether it was the language people used, or something else that I didn’t appreciate, I just made it clear where I stood and I felt that I was respected for it. I’m not saying that every woman would have had that same experience. I’m sure there are women who tried to draw lines and they were ignored. I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.”Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ’s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE.The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ’s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE’s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over.Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show – Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work.“That floor is a TV station,” says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. “There is pomp and circumstance, but it’s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.”Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example – the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring “judgment”, she says. “One analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don’t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,” she says.Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE’s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems.One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ’s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money.The competition – and some investors – are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US’s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading.Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere.The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed – it does not include the dark pools, for example – and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme.It is a complicated issue, but one that will require Cunningham to spend more of her time in Washington.“The biggest worry for her is that the regulatory tailwinds are going the other way,” said Ronan Ryan, the president of IEX. Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates.There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a “clearly failing” business model.And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing – and fast – but the NYSE remains the world’s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position.“The future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,” she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE “is uniquely positioned” to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack.On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE – it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel – we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents – all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f9327029a24bb152cc84e957d1f6da0570becd/43_982_3554_2133/master/3554.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ce164e352a47415db825eb0fcf95a5","title":"melancholy isolation pittsburghs parking lot attendants in pictures","story":"Given Pittsburgh’s poor public transport, many commuters choose to drive.

It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Look out for Clinique’s “purity patrol” fleet, carrying commuters around London, Manchester and Birmingham in air-purified rickshaws from 19-21 July.

If we could just find those forms or the pieces of bureaucracy to remove, then the people before me would have done it. It’s a much more complex issue than that.”While teacher workload is not a new issue, Hinds said that recent developments, such as increased email contact with parents, data entry demands by school leaders and fashionable theories of “deep marking” – often in triplicate – had made matters worse for those at the chalkface.“Email makes contact from and with parents much more frequent and there can be an expectation of rapid response. All of us get this in our working lives, but when you are a teacher dealing with a classroom full of kids, with parents who have high expectations, then I think that pressure can be particularly great,” Hinds said.The DfE’s new workload toolkit will highlight schools that have got rid of onerous practices and policies such as lesson planning and data entry designed to minutely track pupil performance.Hinds has also pledged to end the constant cycle of reforms and tinkering from his own department that have caused extra workload for teachers.In the meantime he is trying to squeeze more funding out the Treasury, a task made more difficult by the early announcement of an additional £20bn for the NHS as a special case.“Education is a special case too. We’re responsible for helping parents, supporting them in the bringing up of the next generation,” Hinds said. “We’re responsible for helping to drive productivity, which drives economic growth. We need people to fill the jobs of the future, and some of those we can’t predict yet what they are, but we are also in the business of helping kids grow up into happy and fulfilled adults. So education is absolutely a special case.”After Labour was perceived as making education spending a vote-winner at the last election, Hinds was at pains to highlight his government’s record, pointing to the £1.3bn moved to hold per pupil funding for a further two years at a time when pupil numbers were growing.“Schools do manage their budgets very well. I recognise that budgets are tight – there have been particular cost pressures over the last two or three years. The work we’re doing on purchasing, on recruitment costs, on supply agencies and so on, that is to help managing cost pressures,” he said.The lack of an agreement with Treasury has probably delayed the DfE’s response to the teacher pay review panel’s recommendation. If no extra funds are forthcoming then any pay rise mandated by the DfE would have to come out of existing school budgets.On Friday the leaders of three education unions – the Association of School and College Leaders, the National Association of Head Teachers and the National Education Union – wrote to Hinds to complain the delay had left school budgets in limbo.“The impact of not fully funding the pay award will bring schools to crisis point and place our headteacher members in an invidious position, making it necessary to set deficit budgets and leading to schools becoming insolvent,” the unions said.But with parliament’s recess approaching, Hinds remains tight-lipped. “There is a process across government, and we are part-way through that process at the moment,” he said.Hinds was quick to praise teachers who have had to endure the overhaul of the curriculum and exam content for both GCSEs and A-levels. But he is convinced that the overhaul was needed because of years of grade inflation.“I think the system has responded incredibly well to the reforms, and we’ve see that coming through in the results. I don’t apologise for saying we should have high academic standards.”The tougher new exams are likely to have made exam season more fraught but Hinds regards that as part of their purpose. “Part of school, a big part, is about preparing young people for the reality of life, which does have its ups and its down. Ultimately we do need to have examinations.”But he said exam stress did not belong in primary schools.“When we talk about national assessments, at the end of primary school, it’s really, really not good to be putting pressure on children for those. Those are not public exams in the sense that the results are going to stay with you in later life.”The government’s policy of allowing grammar schools to expand, for the first time in many years, has attracted controversy. But Hinds said their expansion made up only a fraction of the growth seen across secondary schools as pupil numbers rose.Critics maintain that children from disadvantaged families struggle to gain admission to grammar schools, often denied the advantages of parental support and private tutoring of their better-off peers. But Hinds has a blunt warning for grammars wanting a slice of the Department for Education’s £50m expansion fund: “A simple measure is kids on free school meals – I want to see more kids on free school meals at grammar schools.”The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “Thanks to campaigning by teachers across the country, ministers have finally conceded that their workloads have now become unacceptable.“The best thing the government could do for teachers’ morale is commit to new funding to give our teachers the pay rise they deserve and schools the resources they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74987334b1c64cb7ee79d11aa012f97e0ba175c5/0_95_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5948c8a07ecb7e67c8ff73748f95b4cc","title":"formerly extinct ibis taught to migrate by following light aircraft","story":"Birds bred in captivity led on three-week migration south from Germany by human ‘foster parents’Leaning out of an ultralight aircraft, Corinna Esterer turns toward a flock of peculiar black birds soaring just a few metres away. “Come, come ibis,” she yells through her megaphone. Drawn by Esterer’s voice, the birds dart to the aircraft, and follow it to a field overlooking Lake Constance in southern Germany. Once on the ground, the ibis flock to Esterer. To the birds, the young woman is their parent.For more than 300 years, the northern bald ibis has been extinct in the wild in central Europe, with small populations surviving only in zoos. But recently, it has celebrated a slow but steady comeback thanks to human foster parents who have shown the birds how to migrate south by leading the way in ultralight aircraft.This year is the fifth time the team has taken young birds that hatched in captivity on a three-week migration across the Alps to their wintering grounds in Tuscany.More than 100 iniduals now live independently in southern Germany and Austria. The first generations have already bred in the wild, and taught their offspring the same migratory path they learned from their human parents. Preparations for this year’s migration started when the foster parents took in 31 chicks at the Vienna zoo when they were just a few days old. They were fed 10 times a day and began to recognise the women feeding them as parents, before they were taken to their training camp at Lake Constance several weeks later.Fritz said he drew inspiration from the 1996 film Fly Away Home in which one character, Amy, flies an ultralight aircraft to show a flock of orphaned geese their migratory path. At the time of the movie’s release, Fritz was working on his PhD at a behavioural science research institute that had started to work with northern bald ibis chicks born in a zoo. Despite having only survived in zoos for centuries the young birds’ instinct to migrate kicked in, and in August they tried to fly south. But without an elder bird to guide them, they died along the way. “When we saw the movie, we joked that we could do what Amy was doing with the geese,” Fritz said.Following a feasibility study that took 10 years, the project received more than €4m (about half of it from the EU) to establish a viable population in the wild. That critical point has been reached, Fritz said, but the benefits go beyond just the reintroduction of the birds. Using GPS trackers on the birds’ backs, the team has managed to better understand how migratory birds save energy by flying in their typical V-formation.Research is also under way to understand when and how the ibis decided to swap positions within the V-formation. And in the future, human-led migration might have to help with the reintroduction of other migratory birds, which are under threat worldwide mostly due to loss of habitat, but also because of collisions with glass buildings, electric poles and wires.For now, however, the main worry is getting the birds to follow the aircraft. While they have a strong bond with their “mothers” and follow them around on the ground, flying is more difficult, Fritz said.On a recent afternoon, only half of the flock followed the aircraft, while the other half was so confused that they simply returned to their aviary looking for their parent. “They don’t totally get yet when their parents are sitting in there,” Fritz said as he pushed the aircraft – essentially a metal cage with two small seats, a propeller and a parachute – back into a small shelter. “But one day, just like that, it clicks. And then, we can take them to Tuscany.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0757ab55701b88b9275fc32f74043dd64715bc1/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c62b8aaea1a8e23092df11d00915632","title":"smart meters to save uk households only 11 a year report finds","story":"Report by MPs and peers says predicted benefits of £11bn scheme to install 53m devices are ‘likely to be slashed even further’Government predictions of the savings smart meters will generate for consumers are inflated, out of date and based on several “questionable assumptions”, a group of MPs and peers has said.They also said the rollout of smart meters risks going over budget, is past its deadline and must be reviewed immediately.The £11bn scheme to put 53m devices in 30m homes and small businesses by 2020 has been “plagued by repeated delays and cost increases”, the head of the British Infrastructure Group of Parliamentarians (BIG) said.The group also warned of high numbers of the devices “going dumb” after installation due to problems caused by switching provider or mobile data coverage.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy project is already being investigated for a third time by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog.In a report backed by 93 parliamentarians, the BIG said suppliers were “almost certain” to miss the 2020 roll-out deadline and its benefits were “likely to be slashed even further”.“Although the entire programme has been funded by customers through higher energy bills, unlike energy suppliers themselves, they are not presently guaranteed to see the majority of the savings that do materialise,” said the group’s chairman, Conservative MP Grant Shapps.“This report ... calls on the UK government to immediately review the progress of rollout, and intervene to tackle its points of failure and risk.”The report referred to a 2016 paper by the business department that said the expected saving on an annual dual fuel bill in 2020 had more than halved, from £26 to £11.14.Meanwhile, costs are increasing, with installation costing £1bn more than planned, threatening to eventually outstrip the £16.7bn gross benefit the project was supposed to deliver.The BIG said government predictions that consumers would save £300m in 2020, rising annually after that, were inflated, outdated and “based on a number of questionable assumptions of personal, industry and environmental savings”.Groundwork for the project began under Labour in 2008 and had been billed as having no downsides, with the technology helping consumers to reduce energy use and suppliers manage demand more efficiently.In theory this would cut costs to suppliers and reduce consumer bills while being better for the environment.However, suppliers have fallen behind schedule, with just over 11 million smart meters reported to have been operational by March 2018. That leaves three years to fit more than 40 million by the 2020 deadline, equalling nearly 1.3 million a month. By April 2018 large suppliers were only managing to install about 420,000 a month.The BIG also warned that suppliers were still rolling out “obsolete” first generation smart meters, which were supposed to have been succeeded by November 2016.Meanwhile, more than half of the smart meters “go dumb” when a consumer switches provider – about 500,000 a year. Poor mobile data signal in some areas can also cause the meters to “go dumb”, the group said.The report says: “BIG fully supports the rationale behind the energy smart meter roll-out, and the goals it seeks to achieve.“Without urgent action, however, it believes the roll-out could become yet another large-scale public infrastructure project delivered well over time and budget, and which fails to provide the expected consumer benefits.”Robert Cheesewright from Smart Energy GB, the independent firm publicising the rollout, said the introduction of smart meters is a “vital investment for Great Britain, leading to savings that will outweigh the costs by billions of pounds”.“The government and Ofgem have been clear that they expect energy suppliers to pass these savings on to customers,” he said.“The alternative to smart meters is an expensive and outdated analogue system with customers facing the uncertainty of estimated and inaccurate energy bills.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f610254e38cc7f11b03e7517ab9754a89c5831/0_546_3490_2094/master/3490.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c0e45c835335ab29e0c484f763e92c","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A newly discovered bandy bandy snake species, jumping sweetfish and baby tarantulas in Derbyshire are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e91b14ee4ff6565e9e8b3888d3cb2190d3cbeb/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4ae334a28c03a312cfc05c2e8b4cd0","title":"sorry to bother you boots riley","story":"A rip-roaring tale of code-switching and capitalism, it’s the most significant state-of-the-nation satire since Jordan Peele’s masterpiece It is a symbolic narrative that will be familiar to fans of Get Out: the one way for black people to truly succeed in a white world is to become, figuratively and literally, white. In many ways, Sorry to Bother You is very much a post-Get Out experience, despite the fact that Riley had been trying to make the film for many years (the screenplay was published in full in McSweeney’s Quarterly in 2014). “Unfortunately, the world hasn’t changed enough to make the movie irrelevant,” he told the audience at this year’s Sundance, where the film picked up the much deserved Vanguard award. “It’s of the time and the movement going on right now.” Both films are genre-blending comedy-horrors addressing heavy concepts such as systemic racism and oppression, the theft and repossession of black bodies by white America, the dark reality of labour in capitalist society and the way in which these villainous forces are disguised. Like Jordan Peele’s instant classic, Sorry to Bother You (directed by musician-turned-director Boots Riley) is a “social thriller” (a term first coined by Peele) where the villain is not just one person or family, but an insidious idea at the root of society itself.These movies ask the viewer: what if you found out you were living in silent solidarity with the most diabolical villains ever? Would you recognise it and would you do something about it? In Sorry to Bother You, Riley observes the many ways in which capitalism (and the forces that uphold it) manipulates, controls and ultimately destroys the inidual.Although Sorry to Bother You could be perceived as an allegory for slavery, the movie doesn’t poke at white guilt or mine it for punchlines as much as Get Out (remember Rose’s father: “I would’ve voted for Obama a third time, if I could”). Instead, with wit and wackiness, it scratches around at the idea of how readily we are all willing to ignore the obvious horror in front of our faces at all times.Set in Oakland, California, where writer-director Riley was born and lived for 30 years, the theme of rising rent, lower wages and fewer careers couldn’t be more relevant. Oakland and San Francisco are among the most expensive cities to live in the US, by a considerable margin. Cassius takes the telemarketing job out of desperate economic necessity: he is down and out and living in his uncle’s garage with his girlfriend (Tessa Thompson). Stanfield had previously appeared as the unsettlingly bodysnatched Andre in Get Out (“I find that the African-American experience for me has been for the most part very good”) but here his “white voice” is played for laughs: a code-switching nod to the likes of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy who both did “white voice” in their standup routines, exposing some uneasy truths. In Sorry to Bother You, Glover’s Langston spells it out for Cassius: his “white voice” succeeds because it sounds like wealth – a cadence that rings with a happy-go-lucky economic solvency. “In America, you see people who are code-switching all the time,” says US writer and broadcaster Touré, “not to become some sort of Oreo but being able to adopt that sort of white voice to make white people feel comfortable and then being able to switch back and speak to black audiences and send the message of: ‘I’m still one of you.’ You see that in Barack Obama, you see that in Oprah Winfrey. I’ve never seen a film that deals with code-switching in such a great, subversive way. It’s important and valuable but also problematic and fraught with pitfalls.”The film’s “of its time” satire feels starker and more batshit than Get Out, too, possibly due to its timing. Although Peele’s film has been seen as a icy comment on Donald Trump, it was made in the Obama era and released in the States only a few days after Trump’s inauguration. Sorry to Bother You comes out at a very different time, in an era of child separations, the continued visibility of the “alt-right” and a toxicity around the word “immigrant”.Indeed, the stakes are naturally much higher for any “social thriller” that comes out post-Trump’s first year (see also: The First Purge). Speaking on the theme, Peele told Business Insider last year: “The best and scariest monsters in the world are human beings and what we are capable of especially when we get together.” His forthcoming film Us, featuring warring couples, one black (Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke) and one white (Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker) follows this blueprint. “I’ve been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact,” he said. This is where Sorry to Bother You is coming from, forming part of the “movement” Riley speaks about. In a New York Times profile of Stanfield, he is singled out alongside the likes of Donald Glover, Issa Rae and by implication Janelle Monáe, creatives who subvert the normal tropes assigned to black stars in the public sphere. “(Stanfield)’s interested in being weird and holding that space that, particularly for artists of color, hasn’t always been accessible,” Stanfield’s co-star Thompson told the NYT: “The folks that take that and own that, those outliers, are remarkable, and really important culturally.”In these terms Sorry to Bother You can be seen a victory lap both Stanfield and Riley have taken a cinematic universe most associated with surreal white auteurs such as Wes Anderson, Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze and repurposed it for an all-black cast and world in the same way that Get Out reignited the horror genre by bringing ersity into the room. By the normal rules of Hollywood, an oddball character actor such Stanfield would be relegated to a “kooky best friend” role, but in Riley’s universe he’s the lead. “To see this epic allegory about race is interesting,” says Touré. “In America we are constantly talking about race, even when we’re pretending that we’re not talking about race.” Sorry to Bother You is in cinemas soon "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/284ee5a4ce68d96fe20c418c8a5987464093d269/56_24_1684_1011/master/1684.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80ee154b10be84417d233ce513584497","title":"maurizio sarri fun times chelsea","story":"When Claudio Ranieri first arrived in the Premier League, he caused a minor stir because of his inability to speak to the media in English. “Ranieri finds trouble in translation” was the headline in the  after Chelsea lost to Everton in November 2000, which goes to show how tough it was for the affable Italian during his early days as an outsider in a strange and suspicious country.The man who would eventually lead Leicester City to the title was the Manuel to English football’s Basil Fawlty, raising the hackles with his inability to communicate with players and supporters. Yet at least Ranieri’s insistence on speaking to the media in Italian gave rise to one of the great comedy episodes. The story goes that when Ranieri had finished giving a detailed three-minute answer, his interpreter would nod and say “It’s a game of two halves” in English.Whether or not this is an urban myth is not entirely clear. But let’s agree that it definitely did happen given that the tale came to mind when Chelsea’s media team had to correct a couple of mistranslations after Maurizio Sarri’s unveiling at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Sarri had introduced himself to the English media in Italian, just like Ranieri did back in the day, and the interpreter had made one or two small errors.Point No\u0026nbsp1: when Chelsea’s new manager revealed that he wanted to add “a pinch of quality” in central defence, he had actually mentioned central midfield. Makes sense, I thought, my mind drifting back to the February evening when Tiémoué Bakayoko played as though his shoelaces were tied together during a 4-1 defeat by Watford, the January evening when Antonio Conte looked at Ross Barkley as if he was a piece of pineapple on a pizza and the September evening when Chelsea completed their Danny Drinkwater coup.Moving on, then, point No\u0026nbsp2 referred to the moment when Sarri appeared to suggest that entertaining defeats can be more enjoyable than boring wins. Here was a reminder of how much language matters, how one slip of the tongue can alter our impression of a manager before he has even taken charge of his first game. It was the kind of comment with the potential to make José Mourinho add Sarri’s name to his big book of Poets, Philosophers and Other Romantic Losers. In red ink. And capital letters.What Sarri had actually tried to get across was that fun and winning should go hand in hand. Yet even that sounded strange, if only because football can be such a serious business. In fact, there were a few times when I had to check my headphones to make sure I was hearing correctly, not least when Sarri announced that the transfer market bores him and he prefers to develop his players with good coaching. A check with Chelsea’s press officer confirmed that the former Napoli manager had not demanded that Roman Abramovich buy him Neymar for £500m and a pair of gold shoes.Sarri is different. The 59-year-old is a former banker who never played professionally and, although he is yet to win any trophies, there is a reason he has developed close friendships with Pep Guardiola and Arrigo Sacchi. “Ours is not a sport but a game,” he said. “Anybody who plays a game started doing it as a child for fun and the child in us must be nurtured because this often makes us the best. To create play that is fun is the first thing to obtain a style for a high-level squad.”That beautiful, refreshing sentiment was not said for effect. Sarri meant every word, proof that he is not afraid to stand out from the crowd. Conte liked to talk about the need to work hard. His successor’s buzzword is “fun”.Admittedly that can make Sarri sound a little like an enthusiastic children’s party entertainer whose sunny world view is about to be crushed by a room of screaming brats and tired parents, while there is a strong chance that a slow start would leave him vulnerable to being dismissed as an overly cheery fraud who must adopt a win-at-all-costs mentality. Look how Guardiola was received after his first year in England.The refusal to conform can make people uncomfortable and it is debatable if a manager with Sarri’s track record will succeed in his quest to lighten the mood at Chelsea. On the one hand he could be an inspired appointment. On the other we could be six months away from the damning articles about where it all went wrong. “At first Maurizio had a smile on his face every day,” a top inside source will say. “But you could see he was losing the will to live when David Luiz kept responding to everything he said by sticking his fingers in his ears and shouting ‘La La La La’.”Chelsea, who are having an uncertain summer, might have to accept that their reinvention as the freewheeling Funtime Sarris will take time. Encouragingly, however, there are signs that the tone of the conversation is changing. Suspicion has become less fashionable than a willingness to engage with fresh ideas, empathy a more desirable and modern quality than attention-seeking abrasiveness.More than anything, the reaction to England’s World Cup run showed that people crave a connection with their team. Almost 20 years after the chuckles at Ranieri’s expense, English football is prepared for a new way of talking. Listen closely enough and it might put a smile on your face."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f29fd0f327e7f935b1d6176357b82e4d84a54a5/317_364_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd6228726c79eebfa349569c1f4d1182","title":"naby keita liverpool interview gerrard iniesta rb leipzig","story":"The midfielder idolised Steven Gerrard while growing up in Guinea – now he has taken on his No8 shirt and has made an immediate impactEwood Park on Thursday night and it is not only updates on Alisson’s world-record move to Anfield that is enthralling thousands of Liverpool fans in the Darwen End stand. The second-half performance of Naby Keïta against Blackburn Rovers suggests that for Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp here is another high-profile transfer worth the wait.Yes, it was a pre-season friendly against Championship opposition and judgment should be reserved. But early impressions count. Within minutes of his introduction the captain of Guinea freed Daniel Sturridge behind the Blackburn defence with a slide-rule, diagonal pass. His composure on the ball, distribution and movement impressed throughout.One year after agreeing a complex deal with RB Leipzig for the midfielder, one that eventually rose to £52.75m, Liverpool are discovering why the 23-year-old’s father called his son Deco when they played football on the streets of Conakry, the capital of Guinea. In Keïta’s eyes he was a Steven Gerrard or Andrés Iniesta. Klopp will be beside himself if he has landed a combination of the two.“Since I signed for Liverpool my dad has spoken to me a lot about how much he loved them,” says Keïta. “As a kid we used to play in the streets wearing a Liverpool shirt. He had that love of Liverpool back then when I was 11 or 12 years old. Because I’m a midfielder and Steven Gerrard was always the boss of the team I couldn’t be anyone else but Steven Gerrard when I played.“My overall favourite player would be Iniesta. It is his final ball, obviously, his skill and his ability. I know he is not known for his aggression but that is something I have added to my game, even if it is not one of his traits. I think as a midfielder you need to have that aggression as part of your game. But I always admired Deco too. It was funny because my dad loved Deco as a player. He started calling me Deco as a nickname around the house.”Sekou Keïta’s influence on his son’s career continues to this day. Gerrard was at Melwood last month to hand over his old No 8 shirt to Keïta after Liverpool finally broke the deadlock with Leipzig by paying a premium on top of his £48m release clause – a club-record fee at the time.“Eight was always the number I liked going back to my childhood,” says the Guinea international. “It’s also the number my dad wore when he played football so it’s special to me. He wasn’t fortunate enough to play professionally but he did play at a decent level for an amateur team in Conakry. I am aware that it’s a big number here at Liverpool and I am very excited to wear it. I know it was Steven’s number but I am not going to put any extra pressure on myself. What is more important is contributing for this team than the number on your back.“I didn’t know that Steven would be at Melwood so it was a big shock and exciting to be presented with the shirt by him. Steven said: ‘Everyone will be here for you and help you to develop.’ I am here to learn and grow as a player.”Barcelona and Bayern Munich rivalled Liverpool for Keïta’s signature last summer but, even before witnessing the team’s exhilarating run to the Champions League final, he was convinced Anfield should be his next step.Adapting to the physicality of English football should not be an issue for Keïta who, despite his admiration for players such as Iniesta and Deco, readily admits to revelling in the aggressive side of the game. Four red cards last season suggest revelling in it a bit too much. “I think I might have been a bit unfortunate with a couple of those reds,” he says, with a laugh. “The main thing is that they were not for losing my discipline or anything like that. It was just a tackle that was judged to be a little bit stronger than it was.“I am someone who has a real winning mentality. I have a huge desire to win. That is why I am aggressive in a positive sense on the field. My first mindset when I am out on the field is to defend well and not concede. As a midfielder, when you have sealed things up at the back, my job is to provide the ammunition for the strikers and forwards, to create opportunities for them.“I am a team player. My long-term aim has always been to play football at the highest level I possibly could for a big club. When that is in your mind you don’t give up, you constantly fight and battle to make that happen. But that isn’t to say that now I am at a massive club I am going to relax and to stop fighting and battling. I am still going to be the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc4df70e538b670557989ed8aa5d63b88e70124/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f761958def5af390599a3baf24b0584","title":"blind date sophie emily","story":"What were you hoping for?Good conversation, nice food and wine with someone I found attractive.First impressions?When she came in, I was hoping that she was my date.

I only realised this recently, when a vegan friend asked me what to cook for a special occasion. For me, the answer is simple: a celebratory dish involves layers of flavour, multiple textures and a little more effort than usual. It’s something that might be attempted only at the weekend – something along the lines of Thai clay pot noodles.The beetroot, walnut and tofu combine to create some rich, almost meaty flavours and, as a bonus, the noodles turn pink. Smoked tofu and kecap manis can be found in bigger supermarkets and online. While a clay pot is the traditional cooking vessel, a 24-28cm casserole dish will also do here.180g glass vermicelli noodles1 tbsp light soy sauce1 small red onion, peeled and chopped1.5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled5 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped400g beetroot, peeled and roughly chopped80g walnuts, plus 10g extra, to garnish 20g fresh coriander, leaves and stalks separated4 tbsp rapeseed oil1 tsp salt⅔ tsp ground black pepper200g smoked tofu, very thinly sliced widthways (I like Taifun)4 spring onions, white and green parts, finely slicedFor the dressing2 tbsp light soy sauce2 tbsp kecap manis1 tbsp toasted sesame oil250ml vegetable stock (suitable for vegans)Soak the noodles in a large bowl of freshly boiled water until softened – about 10 minutes – then drain and dress with the light soy sauce.Put the onion, ginger and garlic in a food processor, and pulse to mince. Scrape out the mixture, wash the bowl and repeat with the beetroot, walnuts and coriander stalks.Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan over a medium flame and, when hot, fry the minced onion, garlic and ginger paste for 10 minutes, stirring often so it doesn’t catch, until the mix turns a couple of shades darker. Now add the beetroot mixture, cook for 15 minutes, season, then cook for five minutes more, until deep, rich and soft, then turn off the heat.To make the dressing, mix the soy, kecap manis, toasted sesame oil and stock, and set aside.To build the noodle pot, put half the smoked tofu in the base in a single layer, followed by half the noodles (you might need to break them up a bit with your hands, or cut them with kitchen scissors). Top the noodles with two-thirds of the beetroot mixture, then add another layer each of the remaining tofu and noodles. Top with the remaining beetroot mixture.Lightly chop the remaining walnuts and sprinkle over the top with the spring onions. Pour over the dressing, close the lid, put the pot on a medium heat and cook for 12 minutes. Remove the lid, garnish with a handful of finely chopped coriander leaves and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0b6d2e8704d982fdf2c1d20181990580dfef870/0_1119_4080_2448/master/4080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a652a78ef1a13808224f9a82392858f","title":"richard ovenden bodley librarian interview","story":"The author and Oxford fellow on the joys of the city’s Covered Market, the importance of tea and debating with his daughterI go to sleep quickly.

I’m awake when the alarm goes off at 6.25am. My wife is an artist, so she has a different routine in the morning, we converse amicably, but briefly!I’m a creature of habit I can’t leave the house without a cup of tea in my system.

Coco Khan picks out some of the bestA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

In November 2006, Abbey (now Santander) began offering mortgages of five times salary. Vince Cable, then the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesman, called the news “very alarming”, adding that it was “likely that these irresponsible lending practices will lead to financial disaster for many people”.A spokesperson said: “Clydesdale Bank’s latest mortgage offer is available for a very small group of highly qualified customers ... As with all mortgage applications, our lending decisions are based on a full income and expenditure assessment to assess inidual affordability, ensuring that we continue to lend responsibly.”Other lenders have eased lending restrictions in recent years, but none has gone as far as Clydesdale.The other “stretch” happening in the mortgage market is to lengthen the term of the loan. While 25-year terms were the standard in the 1990s, 30 years is now the norm for new borrowers, with many lenders stretching to 35 years to make monthly payments more affordable.But mortgage brokers said they were relaxed about Clydesdale’s new deal. David Hollingworth of London \u0026amp Country said: “I think that this is more about being able to lend borrowers the amount that they can demonstrate will be affordable and to keep a degree of flexibility where appropriate, rather than a move to remove the reins on what a lender is prepared to lend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73395881a93eea864d0c0ced9a184ca74dbeff9c/0_0_3196_1918/master/3196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecd00c211a694f9e2ba7ce405519deb9","title":"we should follow royal mail in delivering fairer pensions for all","story":"Here’s a solution that splits the difference between cushy final salary and shares-based pensionsIs this how we can bridge the absurd gulf between the (mostly) public sector workers who have great final salary-based pensions and the lousy stock market-based pensions for private sector workers? Royal Mail is ditching its final salary scheme, but rather than do what virtually every other privatised company has done and leave its workers at the mercy of under-funded stock market-based pensions, it has found a halfway house between the two. If other companies follow, it\u0026nbspmight just deliver us from pensions penury.The idea is that the new pension will, like a final salary-based scheme, give postal workers a regular income in retirement, based on their service and contributions, with payments rising every year to take account of inflation. So workers have a safety net in retirement. Compare that to the standard private company scheme, where you and your employer throw money into the stock market, and whatever it’s worth on the day you retire has to last you the rest of your life. At that point, your company washes its hands of any responsibility to you.But unlike the traditional final salary scheme, the new Royal Mail retirement pension won’t be guaranteed all the way through retirement. If it becomes too costly, the Royal Mail can temporarily reduce the benefits paid out.Crucially, that means the company is not on the hook for contractually guaranteed payouts. It is these liabilities, says Kevin Wesbroom, of consultants Aon Hewitt, that have terrified company accountants. It is also why final salary schemes have gone into a death-spiral of investing in bonds – because they are the only sure way of covering future financial liabilities – even though their returns have been miserably bad.With final salary schemes, all the risk is on the shoulder of the employer. With stock market defined contribution schemes, all the risk lies with the employee. Royal Mail’s collective defined contribution (CDC) scheme tries to share the responsibility. It’s an idea borrowed from the Netherlands and Denmark (our fabulous global financial centre in London seems incapable of devising schemes that benefit real people) where they have performed well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a431d8ea8637b9566b0d95e4b6997996b3c608d/0_0_2508_1672/master/2508.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8f4ead1676edfb84b0b8d105dad70094 1400w","title":"im always gonna be a nightmare how bhad bhabie went from meme to megastar mc","story":"Danielle Bregoli was a car-thieving TV tearaway at 13. Two years later, she is a major-label rapper. She talks about the friends she lost along the way – and her fight for credibilityIn September 2016, Danielle Bregoli – then 13 years old – flicked her straightened hair over her shoulder and pursed her lips while someone referred to her as the antichrist. Dr Phil, on whose family-counselling TV show she was appearing, was insisting she was not the antichrist her exasperated mother described. So far, so daytime television. But unlike many of the “tearaway teens” stereotyped on shows such as this, Bregoli has grafted the beginnings of a career on to this wobbly scaffolding.If her name is not familiar, you may be aware of her rap alias, Bhad Bhabie, or “cash me ousside”. That catchphrase – a threat to “take this outside”, aimed at the studio audience that was laughing at her – has since become a meme and, for some, a crude summation of her character. “People have this misconception that I’m going to beat them up when I meet them,” the 15-year-old says now. “But it’s like … no. Just ’cause I stand up for myself and I’m honest, that doesn’t mean I’m going to beat people up all the time.”Hearing her speak, Bregoli could be anything from a 12-year-old – when we first meet, she is screeching at her manager about how her hair makes her look homeless – to a jaded 42-year-old, sighing world-wearily. But she is most certainly a child, one introduced to the world on TV thanks to her mother’s distress about her criminal adolescent behaviour (car theft, knife threats, what Bregoli describes as a proximity to drug dealers).Her foray into rap has led to a major-label record deal, a handful of buzzy singles and a US and European tour. Her tracks are often brilliant in their withering focus: Hi Bich bounces along on a belly-shaking trap beat, punctuated by an earworming shopping-list chorus: “White Js, white Porsche  White wrist, white horse  Hi, bitch  Hi, bitch  Hi, bitch  Hi, bitch.” Nearly 15 million people follow her on Instagram. At the centre of this is a girl who oscillates between two personas: the remnants of the primary-school-aged child photographed cheek to cheek with her single mum and the potty-mouthed teen who, on returning to Dr Phil’s sofa last year, told him: “You were nothin’ before I came on this show.”In many ways, Bregoli is a regular kid. In an east London hotel room, she sits curled up in a chair in front of her half-eaten macaroni and cheese and rolls her eyes while talking about boys. She remembers how her close friends, 21-year-old YouTuber model twins Elijah and Isaac Bell, had tried to get her chatting to someone her age, after most of her female friendships fell apart.“And they were like: ‘OK, well, how about this person?’ He was 16. So I start texting him and he was so corny. Saying: ‘What do you wanna talk about?’ What? Is this fourth grade? And then he was all: ‘Do you send pictures?’” – meaning provocative selfies. “Nope, goodbye! Conversation ended and you’re blocked.” She pauses. “And it was like, all right, I don’t have female friends or guy friends or a boyfriend. Well, I’m screwed.” She scoffs. “Pfft. Teen boys are a huge mess.”The day we meet, she is easing into downtime between shows and has shed her usual armour of false lashes and acrylic nail extensions. Barefaced, she throws back her head and laughs one second, then mock-scowls and picks at the rips in her jeans the next. Overall, she comes across as a sweet girl, if perhaps one who may look back in 10 years and cringe at quotes she gave to journalists, some twice her age – or wonder why those adults seemed to want to provoke her.Her words tumble over themselves when she is excited, as though her mouth is playing catchup to a mind moving at a few hundred miles a minute. Case in point: how jaded she sounds when talking about the mechanics of the music business, with less than a year’s experience of it. She launches into several big-name stars, claiming that if people think they wrote their big hits “they’re out of their fucking minds. Half these motherfuckers don’t write shit. And if I did have a ghostwriter … what’s the problem?”If she sounds defensive, that is likely because plenty of observers online – in hip-hop and entertainment more broadly – saw her music as a joke, even as it was becoming enormously popular. Atlantic signed Bregoli in September 2017, after releasing her debut single, These Heaux, in late August. Hi Bich followed and its joint video with her track Whachu Know has racked up more than 100m views on YouTube. All of Bregoli’s singles so far jostle her forward as one of the few young women associated with the US crop of lyrically simplistic, goofy and sometimes arguably violent SoundCloud rappers.She has cultivated friendships with labelmates Lil Skies and YoungBoy Never Broke Again, as well as red-braided collaborator Lil Yachty (he appears on 2018’s Gucci Flip Flops, the title rhymed with “hit your bitch in my socks”). She understands that she is an anomaly in their world, a white child seeming to attach herself to a historically black genre. Her whiteness gives her the privilege of a second chance at being “good” and jars with her drawling Florida-plus-Brooklyn accent. But the sweary brashness is not an act, she insists. “I’m just me, all the time. People think: ‘She must be an innocent little white girl when she’s not performing or making videos.’ But no, I’m me all year round, 247. There’s a softer and harder person in everyone, depending on the time. I’m not gonna walk in a church and say: ‘Wassup bitches?’ No.” She pauses for effect. “I might say it, but it’s gonna be quiet.”Raised in south Florida’s Boynton Beach area, Bregoli says she was a difficult infant. “I had this little Barbie Jeep and used to flick off the nothing behind me because I’d watch my mum do it in her car. I’ve always been a little brat annoying child. I think I’m always gonna be a nightmare, for sure.” Even so, she was friendly with a couple of girls as a pre-teen, around the time when she shared a bed with her mother, who was living with a cancer diagnosis.“And that’s where my life kinda went ...” She motions the swift downward path of a falling jet, blowing a raspberry with her lips. Bregoli had fallen in with one young girl who “got me into selling drugs and doing really stupid shit. I really cared about her, I believed she was a good person, but … she wasn’t.” Now Bregoli sees the time she and her ex-friend spent off the rails as a part of growing up.“It’s not, like, a phase,” she says, tugging at her high ponytail. “I don’t think you call stealing cars and selling drugs a phase.” She chuckles drily. “I think that’s more of … ‘I’m bored, let me figure out something to do.’ I would still do that now if I wanted to, but I don’t. If I’m handed a fucking music career, yeah, I’m gonna stop doing dumb shit and do that instead.”Given how quickly she fell into rap, I ask whether she plans to stick with music for the long haul. She slows down, sounding well aware of how swiftly 15 minutes of meme-induced fame can slip through your fingers. “I definitely do wanna keep doing it – if it were up to me. But if other opportunities come along the way, then, you know …” What about the reality show rumours? She won’t commit. “If I do a reality show, it’d have to be around music. I started something, so I’m gonna … well, not finish it, actually – I’m gonna keep doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66c50e9bd8f2400d537ec4d9e6fb6a2abe6113e5/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6155bed95cebae8934e5d2be4cbc8406 2020w","title":"anna soubry accuses theresa may of capitulating to tory forces of darkness","story":"The Conservative rebel Anna Soubry has accused Theresa May of capitulating to “the forces of darkness” in her party and warned that, as a result, she and her fellow soft Brexiters may not back the final deal the prime minister obtains from Brussels.The former minister accused Jacob Rees-Mogg’s faction of pursuing a hard Brexit that would cost “hundreds of thousands of jobs” and said they were “now running Theresa” because the prime minister was forced on Monday to accept their amendments to the customs bill.In an interview with the , Soubry pledged to carry on fighting for a soft Brexit but conceded that the balance of power within her party had changed. An “ultimate elite, who are playing politics with real lives” had become dominant, she said.Soubry’s intervention followed a dramatic week at Westminster in which Conservative factions have openly battled for control while May tried desperately to keep her job and negotiate Brexit.On Monday, the Broxtowe MP gave a barnstorming speech during the debate on the customs bill, voicing anger at May’s decision to do a deal with Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group to head off a damaging rebellion. Until then Soubry had supported the prime minister’s new softer Brexit strategy that was signed off at Chequers a fortnight ago.Reflecting on those events, Soubry said: “Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was every any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.”The MP said she had been told by the Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, on Monday afternoon that “80 Conservatives, including a large number of members of the government” had told him they would not support the customs bill unless May accepted the ERG amendments.That would have been enough to topple a flagship piece of Brexit legislation, and forced No 10 to agree to the amendments, one of which was designed to frustrate her proposals for a customs arrangement in which HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs could collect some duties on behalf of the European Union.The MP said she believed the ERG were “ruthless bastards” who would stop at nothing because they believed their cause was “bigger than anything else”. She added: “Now that the forces of darkness have got the prize in sight, they are going for it. I’m afraid that Theresa has embraced these people, they are now running Theresa.”ERG members and supporters include a range of Tory backbenchers, from veteran anti-Europe campaigners, such as John Redwood and Bill Cash, through to former ministers David Jones and Steve Baker, and young MPs including Andrea Jenkyns, who want to force out May. Rees-Mogg is its chair.Soubry accused May and party whips of operating a double standard, saying: “Jacob Rees-Mogg gets his tummy tickled when the ERG threatens to vote against a government bill unless it is amended on policy.”In contrast, when her ally Dominic Grieve “suggested parliament should have a vote in the event of no deal, which is process”, he and his potential Tory supporters were treated differently. “You are threatened, you are called a traitor, you are threatened with deselection, threats the like of which have never been seen before,” she said.Soubry warned the prime minister that she and her smaller group of about a dozen “mutineers” had not given up and could not be relied upon to vote for whatever the prime minister brought back from her Brexit negotiations.The 61-year-old MP said her view of the tight parliamentary arithmetic was that May would have to rely on about a dozen or so Labour MPs to vote with her because she believed that a hardcore of Tory ERG members would not vote for whatever was proposed.About five Labour MPs, including Kate Hoey and Frank Field, have consistently voted with the government on Brexit, but Soubry said more Labour MPs would be needed for May to see off any Tory rebellions: “She needs the likes of Caroline Flint to get it through.”Soubry conceded that the Tory remainer faction lacked the strength and discipline of the ERG up until now, adding that she and like-minded colleagues “needed to grow a pair” because they had failed to pull out or pulled back from the brink when confronting the government on Brexit.Soubry said the remainers needed to muster 16 rebels if they were to defeat the government, assuming all the opposition parties voted alongside them. “We did have at least 16 when the EU withdrawal bill came back, and the big mistake was that we did not do what we said we would do, which was have a vote on the Kerr amendment, which was very tame. That is recognised as being a mistake.”If passed by MPs last month, that amendment, proposed by the former diplomat now crossbench peer John Kerr, would have forced ministers to explain what they had done to pursue remaining in a customs union.Despite her frustrations, Soubry said it would be “deeply irresponsible” for anybody to challenge May and accused the prime minister’s rival Boris Johnson of “naked, blind ambition”.She said the former foreign secretary and his supporters were engaged in “willy-waving”, making light of the consequences of Brexit. “This is deeply grownup, serious stuff. Egos and this sort of willy-waving ambition is deeply unacceptable.”The MP, who was narrowly re-elected with a majority of 863 last year, said she had no intention of leaving the Conservative party, although she cooperates closely in parliament with pro-European Labour backbenchers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie on Brexit. “I shall be true to what I believe.

Everyone can see that this debate is not over,” he said.The British government has said it wants to keep the UK in the EU single market for goods based on a common rulebook. In order to avoid customs checks, the government wants an unprecedented customs system where the UK would collect EU duties, while having the freedom to set different tariffs on goods destined for the British market.Barnier said this “facilitated customs arrangement” raised practical, legal, economic and budgetary questions.Setting out the questions he had posed to the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, during their first meeting on Thursday, Barnier said he was concerned that European businesses would face higher administrative costs and there would be increased opportunity for fraud.Barnier also questioned whether a non-EU country could collect EU customs without being subject to EU oversight. For this reason, EU diplomats say privately that the British plan can never be accepted. The EU is also deeply concerned that the customs plan would give outsider companies a competitive edge over European rivals if Britain and other countries used the UK as a route to avoid higher EU tariffs. “Are the British proposals in the interests of the EU?” Barnier asked.With reference to an EU position paper, which ruled out “cherrypicking” of elements of the bloc’s membership, Barnier made it clear he believed the UK had breached the EU’s red lines. Barnier’s deconstruction of the white paper came after the French government said May’s capitulation to Brexiters in parliament since its publication had made the task of negotiating a deal “even harder”.On Monday, in order to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the Commons, the government reluctantly accepted four amendments put forward by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group of Conservative MPs, who was seeking to wreck May’s proposed custom plans.Arriving in Brussels to meet Barnier, France’s European affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau , said the acceptance by May of amendments backed by hardline Tory Brexiters had further complicated the already troubled talks.She said: “We know there have been amendments to different provisions in Britain, which makes it even harder for us to discuss with our British partners.”Michael Roth, Germany’s Europe minister, said: “I will remain an optimist, but it is hard to remain an optimist in these challenging times.”With doubt growing about the credibility of the white paper, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, admitted the plan agreed at Chequers was merely a starting point for future talks.Questioned by reporters on a visit to Scotland, Hunt twice refused to describe the Chequers plan as the UK’s “final offer” on Brexit. “It’s our substantive offer I think is the best way to phrase it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df1e31a742f2ff4affa3d1d68022bfcc4737924/0_296_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1983ee414ae9d6231bd70288002c1c","title":"margaret thatcher backed single market in draft bruges speech","story":"Documents show that former leader looked forward to development of EU trade rulesMargaret Thatcher was not a proto-Brexiter but an enthusiastic supporter of the single market, according to draft versions of her celebrated 1988 Bruges speech.Often described as the moment the Conservative party proclaimed its disenchantment with Europe, the prime minister’s address in Belgium’s historic trading city has recently been reinterpreted as the beginning of the UK’s long road to withdrawal.But papers made available on Saturday by the Margaret Thatcher Foundation 30 years after its delivery demonstrate that she was looking forward to the development of the single market and was purposefully setting out an alternative vision to compete with that advanced by European federalists.Thatcher’s main collaborator in preparing the lecture was the strongly Europhile Lord Thomas, a Conservative peer who was a distinguished historian of the Spanish civil war and chair of the Centre for Policy Studies. Charles Powell, her adviser on foreign affairs, and Foreign Office officials also worked on the text.In an early note to the prime minister, Thomas, animated by the idea, wrote: “The ‘Europe of Nations’ has never been carefully worked out, to my knowledge. We could be at a turning point in our history.”John Whittingdale, then the prime minister’s political secretary, jotted on a letter about Thomas coming to meet her: “Europe – Must be positive in order to knock down federalist ideas” and “United Europe but not European Union. National provincial cultures v important – must not be lost”.On the draft of another speech, made in April that year at a Lancaster House conference on the single market, Thatcher noted: “Above all, it means a positive attitude of mind: a decision to go all out to make a success of the single market.”But he shared the prime minister’s clear direction, declaring: “We did not vote in 1973 for the creation of a new European union super state.” He added: “We have not embarked on the business of throwing back the frontiers of the state at home only to have a super nation state getting ready to exercise a new dominance.”It was that last resonant phrase, fined tuned in Thatcher’s ultimate version, that distracted public attention from the more positive themes of her lecture such as her contention that: “Our destiny is in Europe, as part of the Community.”In her handwriting on one draft version, the prime minister explained that each country should not “dissolve its own identity but retain it”. There should be, she added: “Positive cooperation between sovereign states.”Elsewhere, she noted: “The objective of the single market came above that of the common agricultural policy” when referring to the original targets of the European economic community.A letter sent by Charles Powell to the Foreign Office on 14 September, the week before Thatcher travelled to Bruges, observed that “the prime minister would like to include … a short paragraph on aspects of the single market where the UK is well ahead of its partners”.She eventually delivered her speech in the medieval city of Bruges, commencing with thanks to the Belgian and Dutch medical staff who had helped British victims of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster the year before.The predominantly Euro-federalist audience may not have been instinctively sympathetic. The aftermath was less positive. That night she dined with the Belgian prime minister.In a note sent afterwards to the UK’s ambassador, she remarked: “I get rather depressed about Europe’s future when I listen to Leo Tindeman’s federalist views: but I hope we managed to get across some points to the others. The speech in Bruges has certainly attracted attention. I hope it will start a serious debate after the first wave of trivial comment.”In her hand-drafted New Year message at the end of 1988, Thatcher reflected on the country’s achievements, including “progress towards the single market in Europe within the framework of the future which was set out in the speech at Bruges”.But Thomas was unhappy with the impact of the speech. Collins said: “An exposition of ‘Europe des patries’ had been written up by the press simply as an attack on federalism and Bruges became famous as an anti-European speech rather than one that set out a workable alternative European ideal to compete with that of the federalists.”  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecee13d5f13e4724a5ef19ea4dc5a49380b46271/0_1243_2528_1516/master/2528.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64d3bb072647d294e841caa35de3381f","title":"colossally naive backlash birth control app","story":"Natural Cycles was hailed as a stress-free, hormone-free contraceptive. Then women began reporting unwanted pregnanciesLast summer I had an abortion. Statistically unremarkable, yes, but mine wasn’t because of a split condom or a missed pill. I was four months into a tense relationship with a much-hyped Swedish “digital contraceptive”, a smartphone app called Natural Cycles. I had spent my 20s on the pill, but hated not knowing whether my emotional state was down to artificial hormones or not. My boyfriend and I had been together for eight months, and I was desperately seeking something new, something that wouldn’t make me feel so anxious.That’s when the adverts started following me around on social media: glowing women reclining in Scandi bedrooms, all pale grey sheets and dappled light, brandishing basal thermometers and telling me how great it felt to “get to know yourself better”. Natural Cycles’ ads promised the “world’s first contraceptive app”, something “natural, hormone free \u0026amp non-invasive”. I could start using it without a two-week wait for a doctor’s appointment and so, in a fug of hormones and frustration, I bought a subscription. I was sold on shiny promises, a sleek user interface and the fact that a former Cern physicist, Elina Berglund, was at the company’s helm. But four months in, it failed. Berglund helped discover the Higgs boson but it turns out her algorithm couldn’t map my menstrual cycle.Femtech, or female health technology, is going through a boom phase, with an estimated $1bn of investment raised worldwide in the last three years. Apps such as Clue, Dot, Glow and Spot On are all popular period trackers, but Natural Cycles is the only one certified as contraception. In 2017, it was approved for use across the EU, getting the green light from the German inspection and certification organisation, Tüv Süd.How does it work? It comprises an app, an annual subscription of about £60, and a thermometer accurate to two decimal points (free in the post). You input your temperature as soon as you wake up, and the app makes predictions about your fertility each day: green for “go have unprotected sex”, red for “not unless you want a baby” (you can also use the app to plan a pregnancy). No hormones, no implant and, supposedly, no stress. It has its own language: users are known as “Cyclers”, and useful information is available via a “Cyclerpedia”. It seems as easy as ordering a takeaway or a taxi from your phone of course there’s an app for fertility, too.Natural Cycles has now registered more than 700,000 users from more than 200 countries, 125,000 of them in the UK. But its certification as contraception is under review in Sweden, where the company and its married co-founders are based. In January, a major Swedish hospital reported that 37 of the 668 women who had sought an abortion there between September and December 2017 were using Natural Cycles as their sole birth control, and the Medical Products Agency of Sweden began to investigate. Natural Cycles has responded that the number of pregnancies is proportional to the registered number of Swedish users and “in line with our expectations” but as someone who didn’t report my own pregnancy last year, keeping it secret even from my parents, I wonder how many more there have been. I spoke to Amy, 29, who was fed up with hormones when she started using the app as her sole birth control. Three months later, she was pregnant, a “massive shock”. Though she admits she may have made a mistake, she can’t pinpoint the error. “You’re told all you need to know is yourself. I believed in it the same way I did the pill and thought I did everything right.” Having already booked her wedding, she went ahead with the pregnancy, giving birth weeks before she walked down the aisle. “It’s supposed to make you feel like you have more control, but in fact it did the opposite: when I fell pregnant it felt like a decision was taken out of our hands. It wasn’t how we’d have planned it, and I don’t recommend weddings two weeks postpartum, but I’m lucky it was something we wanted in the long run.”Marie, 30, first heard about the app when she saw an Instagram post about it (search for Natural Cycles and you will find hundreds of posts by influencers telling you how it changed their lives). “I didn’t spot the hashtag at the very end of the caption which said that it was a sponsored post,” she says. She had been taking Yasmin, a commonly prescribed contraceptive pill, for six years when she made the switch, hoping that the app would be a reliable and easy alternative. A year into a relationship, and eight months into using Natural Cycles, Marie realised she was pregnant. She had an abortion that proved traumatic, contributing to the breakdown of the relationship and leading her into what she describes as “a pit of despair”.She didn’t want to tell anyone about it. She’d had an abortion once before, when a morning-after pill didn’t work, but this time she felt ashamed: “I felt like I’d acted alone in the decision to use the app and had been overly trusting. But I was also angry that I’d been treated like a consumer, not a patient.”Like Marie, I didn’t go to my GP before I switched to the app, probably because I subconsciously knew he’d advise against it. In many ways he knows me better than any algorithm can. He put me on the pill at 18 because I had an irregular cycle. I later learned I had polycystic ovary syndrome, which I now know makes me a terrible candidate for Natural Cycles, because my ovulation is unpredictable and erratic.A year earlier, before I’d heard of the app, I had been to see a gynaecologist to discuss birth control, thinking I wanted a non-hormonal coil fitted. It was the first time a medical professional had helped me to truly understand the extent of my options. She drew me a set of coordinates and plotted each option available (no app got a mention) to show me the benefits and drawbacks. Spotting v cramps, depression v maintenance, long- v short-term.I’d read grim things about the hormonal vaginal ring – a widely shared article about a young, fit woman who died after a blood clot – but agreed, based on what she felt would suit me best, to try it. We laughed at how it’s impossible to research any birth control online without encountering horror stories. I told myself I would trust a professional and cease my Googling as it only induced anxiety but after a few paranoid weeks wearing compression socks to avoid blood clots, I was done.I now know that the ideal Cycler is a narrow, rather old-fashioned category of person. She’s in a stable relationship with a stable lifestyle. (Shift-workers, world-travellers, the sickly, the stressed, insomniacs and sluts be advised.) She’s about 29, and rarely experiences fevers or hangovers. She is savvy about fertility and committed to the effort required to track hers. I could add that her phone is never lost or broken and she’s never late to work. She wakes up at the same time every day, with a charged phone and a thermometer within reach. When I talk to Raoul Scherwitzl, the CEO and co-founder of Natural Cycles, he is charming and sincere and calls at precisely the appointed hour, not a second early or late. “My wife and I represent a typical user-couple,” he says. “Elina was on hormonal birth control for 10 years and we knew we wanted children, but in a couple of years. We both had PhDs in physics and were working at Cern, dealing with messy, fluctuating data, trying to look for the Higgs boson, which is basically looking for a signal amid noise. We started applying the same statistical methods to pinpoint my wife’s ovulation amid her varying temperatures. We read up on the literature and developed an algorithm which our colleagues started using, too. We were running it on the Cern servers and then using Google spreadsheets. We saw it as an unmet need. There was a lack of choice and we wanted to innovate in an important field.” I tell Scherwitzl that, though the need is real, after purchasing the app, caveat after caveat revealed itself. I didn’t know it would take months to become reliable. “The algorithm is cautious by design,” he explains. “It gives red days unless it’s sure.” I tell him how I got pregnant, when the predictions changed after I’d had sex. Scherwitzl empathises (“I am sorry to hear that”) but says that as well as “downsides”, there is “a huge upside with all the happy users” and that “the most important thing is to use protection on red days: it relies on that”.What about the targeted advertising? Isn’t it strange to get social-media influencers (one prominent Swedish blogger is now an investor) to promote a medical product? He doesn’t think so. “Social media allows us to control the narrative because there’s lots of misinformation out there, not just with us but with every type of birth control. We can also target the right age group.”The investigation by Sweden’s medical watchdog is now six months in, and has started its second phase, reviewing marketing material, past clinical studies and fresh user data. Reports of unwanted pregnancies have not, however, had any negative effect on the business.In a 2016 interview I wish I’d read, Scherwitzl’s wife and business partner Elina Berglund described her ideal user as a woman who is planning to have children at some point, and who would like a break from hormonal contraception before trying. It’s not a good option for women who want to entirely avoid a pregnancy, she said. But somehow this message has got lost in Natural Cycles’ marketing this is very much not what the word “contraception” means to me.Indeed, on the section of the Natural Cycles website aimed at medical professionals there is a “decision tree” for doctors considering prescribing the app as birth control. Is the patient over 18? Is she satisfied with her current birth control? If the answers to those questions are yes and no, then the third is: would she be “devastated” to get pregnant within the next year? If the answer is yes, the doctor is told not to prescribe the app. Perhaps those questions should be compulsory when you click through on a Natural Cycle link.Instead, the app assumes the intimate voice of a trusted doctor, mixed with the sort of gamified messaging you find on other apps. You might get an update saying, “Nice curves! You have a nice and smooth temperature curve with small day-to-day variations. Keep up the good work!” The company’s social media is peppered with hashtags such as #yourcyclematters and #wakeupmeasuregetup. The perkiness is grating – even the thermometer bears the slogan “Good morning!” – and can be pressurising, too. One woman I spoke to who bought Natural Cycles to try to plan a pregnancy told the company she wanted to leave after six months, as the daily tracking was too stressful. She emailed to ask for a break, “for emotional wellbeing”. A customer service manager responded to say she could cancel, and reactivate when she wanted, but that “I took a quick look at your data, and in terms of ovulation everything looks good!”, adding, “You do not need to worry about losing any data – we never delete anything!” Those exclamation marks don’t make such reassurances any less creepy.Perhaps this false sense of intimacy is why it felt more like a betrayal to find myself pregnant than if the pill were at fault. After the abortion, the honeymoon period of my relationship ended abruptly. It felt like we’d begun our romantic race with a false start. I stopped using the thermometer and went back on the pill, but it took me a while longer to part ways with the app. I deleted it from my phone, only to realise the direct debit was rolling and non-refundable. I have just been sent another £60 bill, for a contraceptive app I no longer use, that got me pregnant. But it’s not just the money that bothers me – it’s the reminder that I put so much faith in a technology that in the end relied on something as unreliable as my body.

Six weeks into the season, when the writing began to appear on the wall for Woolford’s predecessor, Rick Stone, the possibility of Huddersfield avoiding the Qualifiers this summer was remote at best. Yet now, following a run of eight wins in nine, their top-eight place is assured with a game to spare.Whatever Woolford has done with Huddersfield internally, he would be wise to bottle it and sell it. Trailing 12-0 and 18-12 on two separate occasions here, the Giants were worthy winners. Warrington’s win at Hull KR means the gap to the play-offs is eight points - and even if that is beyond Huddersfield, they surely cannot be completely ruled out just yet.“We may be just too far away from the play-offs but win next week and we can perhaps reassess that,” Woolford claimed afterwards. In terms of the scramble to avoid the Qualifiers, this result leaves the reigning champions, Leeds, with only two sides left to catch. The Rhinos may well have been comfortable 34-0 victors over Widnes across West Yorkshire but, should Catalans and Wakefield win this weekend, the Rhinos’ fate will be secured irrespective of what they do.This is quickly resembling some form of a veterans weekend in Super League. Fresh from 32-year-old James Roby’s talismanic display for St Helens on Thursday as Danny Brough was the undoubted star here for Huddersfield. He was not only instrumental in the play which twice dragged Huddersfield back from losing positions – Castleford having gone ahead via tries from Jamie Ellis, Jake Trueman and Junior Moors – but was just as pivotal after the break, too. “He’s so important to us,” Woolford said of the half-back’s imperious display. He was also aided by his half-back partner Lee Gaskell, who scored the try which helped level matters at the break after Jermaine McGillvary had earlier scored twice.Despite the first half being so evenly contested, it was Brough and Huddersfield who dominated proceedings thereafter. Within seven minutes of the restart, a kick by Brough – who else? – found its way to Leroy Cudjoe, before Brough and Gaskell then combined to free wing Darnell McIntosh. Even though Brough missed both conversion attempts, he was again involved in the try which realistically secured victory, McGillvary crossing for his hat-trick after a fine final ball from Jordan Rankin.It was then left to Brough to add on the penalty that opened up a three-score lead and, perhaps fittingly, that was the final action on the scoreboard.Even if the eight-point gap to the play-offs is too much for Huddersfield to claw back come the Super 8s, you suspect Castleford will not be the last side to be put to the sword like this in 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1ea025be44b6f985bd410ff3cfb1701a288a40/0_172_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddcb96dae5dc292c6b57ea16a9ecae5f","title":"greg rutherford emtional return london stadium long jump","story":"• Long jumper hindered by ankle pain before Anniversary Games• ‘I haven’t trained since Monday,’ 2012 Olympic champion saysGreg Rutherford has said he is emotionally preparing for one final return to the London Stadium – the scene of his long-jump Olympic gold in 2012 – but admitted that constant pain in his left foot has left his training schedule in tatters.Rutherford was part of the British trio including Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill who won Olympic gold on Super Saturday six years ago, but after a rough couple of years he exclusively revealed to the  last month that he will retire later this summer. His performances at the Anniversary Games this weekend will dictate whether he makes the Great Britain squad for a final swansong at the European Championships next month but, no matter the result, Rutherford is hoping to soak up the atmosphere in London one final time.“It’s going to be a very emotional weekend for me,” he said. “The six years since London 2012 have absolutely shot past, and I’ve always had the most amazing reception here. It definitely brings a tear to the eye. I’ll probably be crying more than jumping, to be honest.”Rutherford’s list of injuries also makes eye-watering reading. Four operations on his right ankle, a painful groin reconstruction, hamstring problems and having his stomach wall knitted up have blighted his career in recent years. But it is the pain in his left foot and ankle because of ligament damage that is forcing his early retirement.“I’m in a very different place to where I was a couple of years ago coming into Diamond League events. I know my body is in a bit of a rough place, which is frustrating. Just going out and jumping half-decent would be nice. It’s a bit of a make-or-break weekend because if I jump just over eight metres I probably go to the Europeans. If not, I’ll leave it there and get ready for the last couple of meets that I have.”After long jumping, a career in broadcasting is appealing, but Rutherford also revealed he has had encouraging results preparing for a lab test with British Cycling to see if he can make the transition to bike racing.“As much as I struggle to run in a straight line and jump into a sandpit, I can still produce a lot of power. I was producing a similar level to what an elite international was doing but in trainers, that’s without cleats. Apparently that is quite good.”The long jump field this weekend will feature the reigning world champion Luvo Manyonga, although the world indoor champion Juan Miguel Echevarría – who jumped a wind-assisted 8.83m in Stockholm last month, the biggest long jump in 23 years – has withdrawn injured. This weekend victory may be beyond Rutherford, but should he be selected on Monday for the Europeans next month he could still end his career on a high. “I will only go to Berlin if I feel I still have the chance of winning a medal,” he said. “European long jumping is pretty rubbish at the moment, that’s not me being horrible, it’s pretty awful, hence why there’s still a chance. But I have to do well on Sunday.”Another London 2012 gold-medal winner returning to Stratford this weekend is Jamaica’s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce following the birth of her son, Zyon. The 31-year-old is yet to compete in a Diamond League event this year but is one of the favourites on Saturday , with the British sprinter Dina Asher-Smith in awe of her rival.The London-born 22-year-old is herself adjusting to a new life, having graduated from King’s College with a 2:1 in history last year, recovering from an ankle injury and moving out of her parents’ house in January.“I’ve been just trying to grow up and be an adult, get my head around council tax and bills – food shopping is really expensive,” Asher-Smith said. “I’ve got confidence that I am in good shape. After last year I’ve learned to just have confidence in my ability. Have faith and patience in the process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a5d5f1a34164605d03e25b468b6da18ad12c54c/0_27_2324_1394/master/2324.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97d9debc0511af27d23592dd10528a2c","title":"peter sagan sprints third tour de france victory stage 13","story":"Christian Prudhomme’s appeal for calm before Friday’s 13th stage fell on deaf ears when a lit flare was lobbed into the peloton a few hours later.The flare was thrown from the side of the road towards the end of the stage – which was won by Peter Sagan in a sprint finish – and added weight to the warning sounded by the Tour de France director.Prudhomme had spoken out after tensions increased during Thursday’s chaotic climb of Alpe d’Huez in which Chris Froome was jostled and spat at, and his rival and former Tour de France champion Vincenzo Nibali was forced out of the race after crashing because of a spectator.“We need to restore calm and respect all the riders,” Prudhomme said. “It was a very annoying climb of Alpe d’Huez. The riders on the Tour, and champions of the Tour, must be respected, as they are by the large majority of the public.“It was very calm for 10 days, with only a few anti-Froome or anti-Sky placards, but at a stroke, it all went up again.”The cumulative effect of serial doping scandals, from the Festina Affair to Lance Armstrong, is that there is less respect for the Tour peloton now than 20 years ago. Meanwhile, the knives that have been out for Froome and Team Sky since the Grand Départ in the Vendée are now being sharpened.The 13th stage , from Bourg d’Oisans to Valence, raced by a peloton shorn of many big-name sprinters, was won with a degree of inevitability by Sagan but the day’s events were overshadowed by the aftermath of the chaos on Alpe d’Huez.Nibali was forced to leave the Tour following his crash. The 2014 champion, chasing Froome through a pall of smoke caused by roadside flares, was brought down by a strap hanging over the barriers from a spectator’s camera.After a 120km round trip from Alpe d’Huez to a Grenoble hospital where his fractured vertebrae were confirmed, Nibali was visited late on Thursday night at his hotel by an apologetic Prudhomme. The Italian is likely to return to racing at the Vuelta a España, while his team, although angered by his crash, are not expected to take any further action.“It’s a paradox that Vincenzo Nibali, who has nothing to do with Team Sky, ended up on the tarmac,” Prudhomme said.Asked about that incident and about his own treatment by spectators, Froome was critical. “During the race, it’s the responsibility of the organisers to protect the riders,” Froome said.Although Team Sky’s principal, Dave Brailsford, said “you expect professional athletes to play and entertain without being impacted on by the crowd”, the team’s head of technical operations, Carsten Jeppesen, told the  that rider security on Alpe d’Huez had actually been improved.“They have done a lot more than usual,” Jeppesen said of the race organisers, ASO. “I think they’ve done a really good job actually. ASO takes it seriously and they are trying to bring in more cops and make sure that certain key points are taken care of.“Luckily Chris was not knocked off by the guy that pushed him, but it’s Alpe d’Huez. It’s not the first time something like that happened there. It is one of the iconic places in the sport and there was also a lot of British fans out there and a lot of support.”Despite that, Froome and Thomas were booed yet again at Friday’s start although it is clear the reigning champion is seen as the villain of the piece.The French media, now expecting a sixth Team Sky win in seven years, have also picked up the baton. Team Sky was described as the “snake with two heads” by Liberation, while L’Equipe said that “when you wear the jersey of the British team, suspicion is as contagious as herpes”.The physicality of Thomas’s strength to sprint clear of his peers at the top of the exhausting climb to Alpe d’Huez, brought comparisons with Eddy Merckx from one veteran in the press room. But it also brought eye-rolling and derision from others, baffled by Sky’s continuing production line of Grand Tour contenders.“If my grandma rode for Sky she could win the Tour,” a fan named as Jules told L’Equipe after he had booed and jeered Thomas’s success on the Alpe.Meanwhile, some believe that Thomas is merely Froome’s stooge, a glorified lead-out man, there to take the sting out of the world time trial champion, Tom Dumoulin, before the final and potentially decisive time trial next Saturday to Espelette.But what if Thomas is the one bluffing? What if Sky harbour doubts about Froome’s capacity, after his win in the Giro d’Italia, to rise to the challenge of winning his fourth Grand Tour in a row, a feat which, incredibly, would equate to being unbeaten for three whole months of racing?What if, rather than being simply a decoy for the under-fire Froome, jeered and jostled from the Vendée to Valence, it was always all about Thomas, and enabling him to profit from Dumoulin’s focus on marking Froome? In Team Sky’s long history of befuddling cycling’s establishment with doublethink and contradiction, that might yet be the greatest coup of them all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d94b3d1e35f61213b39c577c1f3f1d97f148eab/0_37_2249_1349/master/2249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f863bfac8b3d2973ba47afaa7edb4f81","title":"sophia dunkley womens super league england","story":"When the third edition of the Kia Super League gets under way at Guildford on Sunday, there is one player for whom there will be more than just the trophy at stake.For 20-year-old Sophia Dunkley, who represents Surrey Stars, it is the opportunity she has been waiting for finally to stake her claim on an England place. “It’s about making a name for myself and getting a bit more noticed,” she says. “If I’m able to put in a few good performances, it would help massively.”The all-rounder recently spent time with the England squad during their series against New Zealand, a reward for her run of form during the domestic season, including scores of 63 not out and 91 for the England Academy in their warm-up games against New Zealand.“I’ve been training with England, running drinks during the matches, seeing what it’s like to be in that environment,” she says. “I’ve loved being a part of it.”A formal call-up into the England side remains elusive but an expanded Super League presents the ideal chance to push her case. This time each of the six regional franchises will contest 10 group-stage games, doubling last year’s fixture list. Sky will also be broadcasting 12 of the matches live, while all of Stars’ home games will be livestreamed via the Surrey website.“I’m really excited,” Dunkley says. “It’s starting earlier this year, going on for longer, and I can’t wait to get stuck in.”Since it was launched in 2016 the Super League has sought to provide a higher level of competition for domestic women’s players than county cricket supplies, and Dunkley is clear it has done just that: “Being able to play at bigger stadiums, there’s music, the fans are buzzing a lot of us hadn’t experienced that before. That’s what gets everyone quite excited.”Dunkley’s route into cricket was not conventional. Growing up as an only child in a single-parent family in north London, her introduction to the sport came via a neighbour. “He was one of my best friends growing up. We used to live in a cul-de-sac so we were able to play outside. We both joined a club together, a boys’ club, and it just stemmed from there.”“I played at Finchley Cricket Club and went through the youth pathways, then I joined Middlesex. My mum knew people that went to Mill Hill school and I managed to get a sports scholarship there, where I played in the first XI with the boys.”Dunkley says she owes a lot to her mum, who will be at Guildford on Sunday to cheer her on. “She’s done so much for me over the years. Paying for coaches and everything else I needed when I was younger. She used to know nothing about cricket but being around it she’s starting to learn some stuff.”Three years ago she was selected for the England Women’s Academy, the group of players below the international squad. Her game has since come on leaps and bounds, culminating in this season’s purple patch: she averaged 51.5 on the Academy’s tour of South Africa in April and this month played a central role in Middlesex’s victory in the County T20 Cup.For a player who has sometimes been unlucky with injury there is a feeling that this is her time to shine after she missed most of the first KSL in 2016 for unusual reasons. “Two weeks before the start I hit my head on a car door and then in a game later that week I got hit on the head which induced a concussion. I was absolutely gutted,” she recalls.Last year’s tournament, though, brought more opportunities, with Stars reaching Finals Day at Hove, attended by 3,500 spectators – “the biggest crowd I’ve ever played in front of,” says Dunkley. “I knew I might get quite nervous and work myself up so I just said: ‘I’m going to enjoy it and whatever happens, happens.’” It worked: she top-scored in the semi-final, making 30.From a personal perspective she is hoping that in this year’s competition she will get the chance to show what she can do with the ball. Leg-spin – an under-utilised skill in the women’s game – is an art she developed by chance aged 11. “I used to be a seamer and bowl mainly leg-cutters, and I kept flicking my wrist when I released the ball. One of my coaches at Middlesex said: ‘That seems quite natural to you. Why not start bowling leg-spin and see how it goes?’ There aren’t masses of us around so that’s definitely something that can give me an edge.”For Dunkley – who has just finished her second year of a sports science degree at Loughborough University – the aim is an England contract: “I want to go pro,” she says. There is no doubt that, if she does so, the Super League will have played no small part in paving the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6ee4a9fdd8cb839f2d7257590271eec9f348dca/504_459_2407_1444/master/2407.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ba3dca1917c852930cf20e6783090a9","title":"talking horses calett mad the best bet for summer plate at market rasen","story":"Nigel Twiston-Davies’ six-year-old looks good value at 9-1 while Magic Wand should benefit from a fast surface in the Irish OaksThis is one of those Saturdays when the Flat racing in Britain lacks an outstanding feature race, so the betting interest may instead gravitate to Market Rasen, which stages a typically compelling Summer Plate. The very versatile Calett Mad (3.15) looks one to stick with on a sound surface at odds of 9-1.Nigel Twiston-Davies had him in handicap chases at the age of four and he fared well that winter, going down by just a head at Ayr’s Scottish National meeting. He had a productive time over hurdles last season but should now, aged six, be able to improve on his old chasing form and take a hand here.1.50 Newbury It’s interesting to see Frankie Dettori booked to ride once more for Al Shaqab, the pair of them having ended their retainer earlier this month. Dettori was also aboard Fajjaj when he was second in the German Guineas and the colt is worth a try against older horses at this level, despite having been outclassed in the Hampton Court at Royal Ascot when Josephine Gordon was aboard. Cheekpieces are on for the first time.2.25 Newbury He evidently needed his reappearance run at the July meeting but Hochfeld might be capable of a much better showing now, with a bit of extra distance to cover. Mark Johnston’s four-year-old showed plenty of ability when scoring three times at staying distances last summer and seemed happiest on a sound surface. The market is understandably obsessed with the Willie Mullins runner, Stratum, but Hochfeld tempts at the each-way price of 16-1.2.45 Newmarket For the yard that won this Listed prize two years ago, Dramatic Queen is worth a second look. This first attempt at a mile and a half is likely to suit the filly, whose dam won over two miles. She showed some promise when making much of the running in the race won by Sea Of Class last month.3.00 Newbury This is a step down in class for Invincible Army, who was only beaten four lengths when an admittedly disappointing ninth in the Commonwealth Cup. He played up behind the stalls that day and may not have shown his best but looked a horse to follow when scoring at Ascot in May, and pushing Sands Of Mali close at Haydock. He finished in front of Equilateral at the Royal meeting, so it’s not clear that he should be twice the price of that rival here even with a 3lb turnaround.3.35 Newbury A devilish race to unscramble, this two-year-old cavalry charge could fall to Tin Hat, who outran odds of 50-1 to be fifth in the Windsor Castle last month. The horse who finished half a length in front of him that day has since won a Group Two, while two of those behind have since been first and second in a Listed contest. Tin Hat’s previous effort was also sound, so that probably wasn’t a fluke and the chestnut should at least fare well in this scrum.5.30 Curragh Those with access to At The Races will also be able to see the Irish Oaks, in which a fast surface should enable Magic Wand to turn around the Epsom form with her stablemate Forever Together. Odds of 6-4 are fine about a very classy filly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f23f491b97bfd55d4873936c1d7935f3ee0f5b7/734_699_4042_2425/master/4042.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18fc66b523e3e758dc18f9976d6409e","title":"fun frivolity watching tour de france in pictures","story":"By the time the Tour de France finishes in Paris on 29 July, millions of fans will have lined the 2,000-mile route.

In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

The Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson, south-west Missouri, on Thursday evening.Tia Coleman told an Indianapolis TV station that she and her nephew were the only survivors from 11 members of their family who were on the amphibious vehicle when it sank. “I lost all my children, I lost my husband, I lost my mother in law, I lost my father in law, I lost my uncle, I lost my sister in law – she was my sister – and I lost my nephew. I’m OK, but this is really hard,” Coleman told Fox 59 from her hospital bed in Branson. She said her husband would “want the world to know” that when they were in the water the captain of the vehicle told them not to put their life jackets on, an action she believed had cost lives. “The captain told us ‘Don’t worry about grabbing the life jackets, you won’t need them,’ so nobody grabbed them because we listened to the captain and he told us to stay seated,” Coleman said. “However in doing that, when it was time to grab them it was too late. I believe that a lot of people could have been spared.” A spokeswoman for the Cox medical center in Branson said four adults and three children arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. Two adults were in critical condition and the others were treated for minor injuries, Brandei Clifton said.Sheriff Doug Rader of Stone county said stormy weather probably made the boat capsize. Another duck boat on the lake made it safely back to shore.Rader said during a news conference on Friday that he believed the boat sank in 40ft (12m) of water and rolled into 80ft of water.He said the driver of the Ride the Ducks boat died but the captain survived. Steve Lindenberg, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Springfield, Missouri, said the agency issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the Branson area on Thursday evening. Lindenberg said winds reached speeds of more than 60mph (100kmh). “It’s a warning telling people to take shelter,” he said.“There’s nothing to slow down winds in an open area.”Suzanne Smagala with Ripley Entertainment, which owns Ride the Ducks in Branson, said the company was assisting authorities with the rescue effort. Smagala added this was the Branson tour’s only accident in more than 40 years of operation.Video believed to be of the boat sinking was posted on YouTube showing the craft fighting strong wind and high waves before its nose goes under the water line.Donald Trump said on Twitter that his “deepest sympathies” were with those affected in the “terrible boat accident”. “Such a tragedy, such a great loss.”Branson is about 200 miles (320km) south-east of Kansas City and is a popular vacation spot for families and other tourists, with entertainment ranging from theme parks to live music. A tornado that went through downtown Branson in 2012 destroyed dozens of buildings and injured about three dozen people, but killed no one.Duck boats, which can travel on land and in water, have been involved in other deadly incidents in the past. Five college students were killed in 2015 in Seattle when a duck boat collided with a bus, and 13 people died in 1999 when a duck boat sank near Hot Springs, Arkansas.Safety advocates have sought improvements since the Arkansas deaths. Critics argued that part of the problem is that too many agencies regulate the boats with varying safety requirements.Duck boats were originally used by the US military in the second world war to transport troops and supplies, and later were modified for use as sightseeing vehicles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f695f73a667d28d9b64e73b2a5d4d1b80a549c4a/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7f71f19b9ff5c4d14488d1917caaa79","title":"north korea mike pompeo russia china oil sanctions","story":"The US has urged Russia and China to clamp down on repeated breaches of the oil sanctions regime imposed on North Korea, saying America had evidence of at least 89 illegal ship-to-ship oil transfers this year.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, was speaking at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, the day after Russia and China at the UN sanctions committee rejected a US call to step up sanctions saying it needed further evidence of North Korean sanctions evasion.The Russian and Chinese decision at the UN was the first fissure in the international alliance putting pressure on Pyongyang to act on its commitment to end its efforts to become a nuclear power and effectively delayed further discussions on extra sanctions for as long as six months.The US claims on the basis of intelligence that North Korea using ship-to-ship transfers in international waters has breached a cap of 500,000 barrels of refined oil a year – imposed by the security council in December. The US had demanded an immediate halt to all further oil transfers. “Strict enforcement of sanctions” was critical to achieving the goal of North Korea’s denuclearisation, Pompeo said.Despite the diplomatic reverse, Pompeo said after his briefing with the UN that he remained confident that it will be possible to reach an agreement on North Korean denuclearisation, saying it was even possible to envisage North Korea attending meetings at the UN “not as a pariah, but as a friend”.But his call for Russia and China to act on the evidence of North Korean sanctions evasion represents a change in tone from previous US optimistic assessments of the direction the Pyongyang regime was taking. His remarks underscored the US belief that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is acting under duress, and a united international sanctions regime is critical to ensuring final verified denuclearisation.Kim made a broad commitment to denuclearise at an unprecedented summit with Donald Trump in June, but offered no details as to how and when this might take place, leaving considerable doubts about Pyongyang’s intentions.Pompeo reiterated his view that it would take some time and the path ahead was difficult. He also called for sanctions to be tightened on coal imports.Pompeo visited Pyongyang in early July and the two sides struggled to make headway on the denuclearisation issue. At the end of the talks the North Korean foreign ministry accused the US of making unilateral demands and behaving like gangsters. The US senator Lindsey Graham, representing a current of thinking inside the Republican party, said he feared that China had intervened to sour the talks. “I see China’s hands all over this,” he said in the wake of the fruitless Pompeo talks. Pompeo’s visit came immediately after the US on 6 Julyslapped tariffs on $34bn of goods from China, a move that China promptly matched. On Friday, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all $505bn in Chinese imports.Pompeo’s UN briefing was undertaken jointly with the South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, who has struck a more optimistic note this week. She said there was a shared analysis of the situation between China and the US and implied the North Korean leader had taken an irreversible decision. Speaking at Chatham House she said scepticism was necessary given the history of past failed talks but went on: “I think that what is clear is that there is the political will that was not there in any previous negotiations, from the top level, to move in that direction.”She added: “Having come out this far, for him to go back, I think will be hugely risky.”On the North’s demolition of its nuclear-testing site in Punggye-ri, she said, “We will press them, at some point, to verify that this is a genuine closure.”She warned “given the pace of developments there is an expectation that things are going to move very fast. We need to pace ourselves because this will take time.”She also said the US troop presence in South Korea was not part of the talks with the North."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f229c6baf45164c7c2ff1d23547e98bea9727be/0_211_3848_2309/master/3848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937657785ccb07ddc968dbecd57a909a","title":"imran khan near victory in pakistan election but some ask if he is playing fair","story":"Former cricket star galvanises support for PTI party with pledge to end corruptionOn a stage high above a hockey stadium to the north of Lahore, a compere shrieks into the microphone.

Claiming that $10bn (£7.6bn) is laundered out of Pakistan each year, the populist, socially conservative leader hits out at the “traitors who have made this country poor”.Khan’s political fortunes have risen steadily in the year since he successfully petitioned Pakistan’s supreme court to disqualify the former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, on corruption charges. Earlier this month, Sharif was imprisoned on a 10-year sentence: from the stage, a PTI official claims that that a jailer switches on Sharif’s television during Khan’s rallies, forcing him to watch his tormentor-in-chief. “Have you seen Avenfield House?” Mohammed Asif asks outside the rally. “Those are my flats,” says the 33-year-old Khan supporter, referring to four properties in Park Lane, London, which lie at the heart of Sharif’s corruption case. “They belong to the people of Pakistan.”But Khan is a deeply polarising figure and his poison-tongued campaign inflamed political tensions. After he called supporters of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) “donkeys”, an animal charity reported that PTI aficionados had beaten one of the animals close to death.Khan implied in a tweet following the deaths of 149 people an Isis-claimed suicide attack on 13 July in the eastern province of Balochistan that the PML-N was behind the attack as a way to distract attention from Sharif’s legal woes. “Beginning to wonder why whenever Nawaz Sharif is in trouble, there is increasing tension along Pakistan’s borders and a rise in terrorist acts? Is it a mere coincidence?” he asked.More damaging to his claims to represent a break with the status quo is the accusation that Khan is taking advantage of the support of Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, which has ruled the country for nearly half of its coup-studded 71-year history. Polls show the two parties neck-a-neck but PML-N leaders appear so downcast as to have practically conceded. “Sharif is just crying about the election as this is the first time he hasn’t been able to use his own umpire,” Khan said at the Shahdara rally.In political terms, Khan has plenty of incentive to seek out shortcuts, according to analysts . The PML-N has had a broadly positive record in government over the last five years, in which the party has notably reduced power blackouts. According to political commentator Fasi Zaka, this means “it would not have been his election” without a military-backed campaign against the party in which supportive media channels have been taken off air, politicians have been pressured to defect, and the courts selectively targeted its leaders. In a recent interview with Dawn newspaper, Khan lamented that “this is not Europe, you cannot just tell people what you stand for and they will vote for you”. This is a lesson he appears to have learned from the election of 2013, when he worked himself into the ground – eventually falling off stage and being hospitalised.Since then, his campaign has evolved from promises of a “New Pakistan” – better schools, better hospitals, an end to pilfering from the state – into something more traditional. Around one third of his party’s candidates are recently recruited “electables”, long-in-the-tooth politicians who bring with them vote banks and, often, corruption scandals. These characters, many believe, will help the PTI crack the crucial province of Punjab, which returns more than half the 272 directly elected seats in the National Assembly. But former allies told the  that many believe that the party has shifted away from its anti-corruption platform. “There are cuckoos in the PTI nest,” Brigadier Samson Sharif, the party’s ex-shadow defence secretary, said. Khan “now has so many albatrosses hanging around his neck … he is a pied piper leading the people nowhere”. Born in Lahore in 1952, the Oxford-educated cricketer has also undergone what appears to be significant a personal transformation. While he used to party with Mick Jagger, today he defends Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws and criticises “Westoxified” Pakistani liberals. In 2017, the provincial government his party has run for the past five years in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa granted $3m to the Haqqania madrassa, a fount of Taliban fighters, drawing sighs of “Taliban Khan” from the coffee shops frequented by Islamabad’s liberals. Others note the arc of his marriages: first came Jemima Khan, a glamorous British heiress. Earlier this year Khan secretly wed his spiritual adviser, Bushra Maneka. Still, the spectre of an electorally poisonous playboy past was revived with the publication this month of a kiss-and-tell memoir by his second wife, Reham Khan, a former news anchor, PDF copies of which were shared far and wide on Pakistani WhatsApp. She alleges he used “six grams” of cocaine a night, has several love-children and sexts women in his party. “She is just a porn star,” says supporter Zulfikar Ali Khan, repeating the argument of PTI insiders that the book’s publication was co-ordinated with the PML-N. That appears a blessing to Khan for now. But with a looming economic crisis, political instability and an assertive military establishment to handle, Pakistan’s probable next “Captain” will have to zealously guard his own stumps.

Payne said there were clear threats to the “rules-based international order”.The four ministers said these threats justified greater defence and security cooperation between the UK and Australia, supported by an increase in British diplomatic outposts in south-Pacific countries such as Tonga and Vanuatu. “At such a critical juncture in world affairs, we feel it is vital for like-minded nations to join together to promote peace and stability,” Bishop said. “We couldn’t be more delighted that the UK will be taking an increasing role in the Indo-Pacific.”Control of the South China Sea is one of the most contentious and explosive diplomatic issues in East Asia. For centuries, various regional powers have laid claim to the sea, which is rich in fisheries and serves as a shipping lane for more than half of the world’s oil tanker traffic.China maintains fierce territorial disputes with Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines over the 3.5m sq\u0026nbspkm stretch of water that is also believed to have significant oil and gas reserves. At the peak of animosity during the 1970s and 1980s, China and Vietnam used force several times, resulting in dozens of deaths and several sunken ships.Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to “resolutely defend” the region. During the past few years, Beijing has dredged sand on coral reefs to transform them into islands that it uses as military bases, fitted with missile launchers, runways, barracks and radar facilities.The US has grown increasingly alarmed by the military build up. Washington has become involved in the disputes, backing those that oppsoe China and conducting naval patrols.In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague overwhelmingly backed the Philippines in its dispute against Chinese control of atolls near its shores. However, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has looked to China as an economic partner and has not pursued the issue.Citing an increased threat from submarines in the Pacific, operated by unnamed countries, Williamson highlighted Australia’s decision to buy nine Type 26 frigates, which will be built by BAe in Adelaide, and renamed by the Royal Australian Navy as Hunter class vessels.“We have started to see a step change in our relationship,” he said. “For the first time since 2013, Britain has been deploying ships to the Pacific region. We have three this year, and this isn’t something we want to see as a flash in the pan but actually a commitment to the region that goes forward over the coming years.“We’re very much hoping and going to work together on deploying HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Pacific and hopefully sailing side by side with Australian vessels. “And we want to make sure that everyone around the world understands that these two great nations are the greatest of allies.”Deploying HMS Queen Elizabeth to Australian waters would be a big investment for Britain’s Royal Navy. Once operational in 2020, it would normally travel with a “carrier strike group” involving several frigates for anti-submarine warfare, destroyers for air defence and potentially a hunter killer submarine.Bishop and Hunt were also asked about Donald Trump’s demands that Western countries double their defence spending, and whether that was achievable. Bishop said Trump had made “a very valid point” about the need for increased defence spending and “burden sharing” among US allies.

Flash floods, carving through a layer of ochreous clay, have deepened its bed decade by decade, so that the tangle of fuchsia bushes arching from its banks now hide and muffle its day-to-day passage below.At the umpteenth day of drought I took binoculars across the road to look at the stream in the open ravine that ides the sheep’s rocky meadow. Down among mossy boulders, a slow gleam showed.Like our neighbours, we once depended wholly on the stream, piped to the house by gravity from one of its higher pools. Ours needed a tight little dam of rocks and sods to keep water above the pipe’s end. A flood of rain could sweep the dam away a drought could leave the pipe sucking air.Either way meant a long trudge up the hill. In summer sun that could be blissful: a big blue sea and chirping wheatears. Backside to the wind, in Paul Durcan’s treasured phrase, it was often more of a penance.Today we have the luxury of pumped water. With a well drilled down to 240ft (73m – at the deeper range of some 100,000 such wells in the nation), why should I bother if the stream is still running?It gathers itself in a small stretch of bog in the lap of the ridge. I have seen this, perhaps too breezily, as our upland reservoir. If months of drought dry it up, what then? An accomplished worrier, I choose to discount the endless, squelching abundance of the spring.I also try to picture what it’s like, down at the well pipe’s end. A big pond full of water, replenished by trickles from above? Or a crevice that will just keep flowing, so long as we don’t flush too often?The man with the rig, from Donegal and an excellent judge of these things, stopped the remorseless rumble and chatter of the drill when enough of the right-coloured water came gushing up. Then the health people had to test it, or we wouldn’t get a county grant. But no iron, sulphate, arsenic or E coli just sometimes, in a frosty winter, a bit cold to drink from the tap.According to the map of The Geology of South Mayo, our hillside wedge of bedrock is “grey-green lithic turbidic sandstones with blue-grey slates with black laminae”. They came from the seabed of the vanished ocean of Iapetus and were fractured and cracked in the big heave into mountains,.But there’s sandstone and there’s sandstone. The Environmental Protection Agency says: “In contrast with most other EU countries, the bedrock aquifers in Ireland have fissure permeability only.” Water flow, it insists, “is predominantly through fissures or fractures and not through pore spaces in the rock itself”. That’s clearly true of much limestone, but some dense, fine-grained Irish sandstone can also be as hard as steel.For much of the natural world, meanwhile, the trials of drought are recurrent and familiar. A holiday in Provence once showed me little snails clustered together at the top of tall, dry stems at the roadside. They were aestivating – hibernating, staying dormant – clear of the baking soil and up in the wind.In much of Ireland, our earthworms have been aestivating (Latin aestes  summer), wrapping their bodies into knots at the bottom of their holes and sealing their chamber with mucus to keep in some humidity. And snails, rather than climbing, work their way into the soil and exude more mucus as protection while they sleep.Our woodshed swallows are flying overtime to catch midges for their young: a depleted generation is missing, as their eggs dry out in the dwindling of bog pools, marsh and mud. Dragonflies eat midges, too, but exceptional droughts can threaten their own populations of aquatic larvae.Bats need midges for food, but also night-flying moths. In Britain, which shared with Ireland the three-month summer drought of 1976, the withering of specific wild food plants and loss of caterpillars brought a crash in some species of moths and butterflies.In rich ecosystems, such as streams, droughts can have complex effects. Studies of hill streams in Scotland and Wales have shown that even when a long drought has killed all the trout, many invertebrates survive in the moist gravel of the streambed. Timing can be critical in deciding what lives and dies, but a couple of years will bring back vagrant mayflies, stoneflies, caddis flies and the rest, along with questing trout, to lay their eggs and colonise."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Agreed date would sidestep blame game for triggering general electionMinister for Employment suggests people save their pensions towards lump sum at 70Officer under investigation also accused of several other instances of malpracticeMs Justice Isobel Kennedy to act as chairwoman ahead of October voteTwo men jailed for 14 and 12 years respectively after violently attacking Irish-born pensionerWoman says self-worth \u0026lsquofell below zero\u0026rsquo after husband violently attacked her while drunkGerry Reynolds and Sinead Maguire selected as party\u0026rsquos two candidates in the constituency for next electionIreland referred to EU Court of Justice over failure to uphold EU law on impartialityMinister for Justice opens new Garda regional headquarters in GalwayEU chief negotiator Barnier says the UK\u0026rsquos White Paper is \u0026lsquoproven unworkable\u0026rsquoQuest seeks adjournment as specialist says woman can take \u0026lsquocurative treatment\u0026rsquoAutomated calls claim internet connections have been \u0026lsquocompromised\u0026rsquoInformation on hundreds reported to have fallen into hands of loyalist paramilitariesStephen Mahady (58) settles action against the hospital on confidential termsShane Ross announces \u0026euro53m National Greenway Strategy in Co WestmeathHotel has housed Syrian refugees for more than a yearMinister claims UK only \u0026lsquopartially\u0026rsquo addressed issue in context of customs thus farTwo infectious patients attended four different hospitals in JulyJudge orders result of vote cannot come into effect for a week to allow plaintiff seek appeal"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3571576.1532104682!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a sister s story she looked like she was asleep","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMemorial plaque to Niamh Doyle in her sister Louise’s home. “My story comes from love,” says Louise. “It’s not to slate anybody – to slate the gardaí or the girl. It’s just a story that I’m telling. Niamh deserves it.” Photograph: Peter MurtaghLouise and Niamh Doyle’s last Christmas together was a good one.They laughed and they joked, they ate and they drank. They snuggled up on Louise’s sofa with her daughter, Rachel, while they chatted and watched TV.For Louise, that Christmas of 2014 is filled with good and treasured memories. Twelve days later, her sister Niamh had her life snatched from her. She was just 19.Last Thursday week, Dayna Kearney (23), the driver of the car in which Niamh died on the N78 near Athy, Co Kildare, was acquitted at Naas Circuit Criminal Court of dangerous driving causing death, and of driving a defective vehicle.Also killed in the car with Niamh on January 6th, 2015, were three of her and Dayna’s friends – Gemma Nolan and Ashling Middleton (both 19) and Chermaine Carroll (20).The 3½ years since then have seen Louise struggling to come to terms with the loss, while trying to find out the hows and the whys of the tragedy as she navigated the sometimes bewildering world of policing and law.Louise’s story is one of enduring love for her sister of quiet but firm determination to cope with has been thrown at her, to represent Niamh in the years after her death, and to keep her name and memory alive.“We had a lovely evening,” Louise says of that last Christmas night. “We were sitting down, chatting away, and I said to her: ‘Do you know, I think that’s actually the best Christmas I ever had.’”Niamh, Louise and Rachel were particularly close. With just six years separating them, Rachel and Niamh were more like sisters than aunt and niece. And Louise, being a 20-year-old mother herself, completed the youthful trio.Niamh spent a lot of time in Louise’s house in Graiguecullen on the edge of Carlow town and often looked after Rachel. On the night before her death, she baby-sat Rachel.“I dropped her home to Mammy’s that night,” says Louise. “She had no key to get into the house, so she stood at the gate and waved at me. I said, just let me know that Mammy’s there to let you in.“She waved goodbye and that was the last time I saw her.”Niamh and her friends died around 10.30pm on January 6th. They had spent the evening ice skating in Kilkenny and were on their way back to Carlow.Louise was at home and remembers exactly what she was doing when word came through, and how she reacted in the days that followed.“My partner was going through the Journal on his phone and this article came up about four girls killed in a car crash. He went into it and he clicked back out of it. He said, ‘Do you know what, I’m not going to read that. We’re having a nice time – I’m not going to read anything like that.’ So he put the phone down.“We went on to bed and never thought anything of it and I got a phone call between 3 and 4am in the morning . . . My father rang me – my brother was just after travelling back to Australia where he worked and I thought there was something wrong. My father said: ‘It’s Niamh, it’s Niamh – you need to come up to the house.’“I said, what are you talking about and he said, ‘Niamh is dead, Niamh is dead’ – that’s all he kept saying. And I said, ‘Jesus, Daddy, will you go back to sleep!’”Louise and Niamh’s father, Ber, had a habit of talking in his sleep and Louise was convinced he was at it again.Handing the phone to her partner, she asked him to ring her mother, Veronica, to get her to, as she thought, wake her father up and get him off the phone.But her father was not sleep-talking.“So that’s how I found out,” she says simply. “From then onwards, I went up to the house and I still didn’t believe it.”It fell to Louise to go to Naas hospital to identify Niamh’s body, taking Rachel with her, at her daughter’s insistence. On the way, she feared what she would see when she got there.“She looked like she was asleep,” Louise recallsin an interview, determined to talk about the crash, about how she and her family coped, about how ordinary people cope with tragedy, and its aftermath.Niamh died from internal injuries. Her body was released after the postmortem and taken to Carpenter’s funeral home in Carlow. Louise took charge – buying Niamh’s funeral clothes in River Island (and a matching set for Rachel) and also Niamh’s favourite make up from the MAC cosmetic range.In her coffin, Niamh was dressed as Louise had ordained – a blue-navy check shirt and necklace (“she loved big necklaces, you know, real vintage, and so I bought one of those”), denim leggings, Nike runners and a pair of odd socks.On one of Niamh’s fingers, Louise placed one of her own rings. Niamh’s boyfriend, Shane, bought her a watch and put it on her wrist.With the help of two friends, Louise made sure Niamh’s face looked her best. The morticians had washed her body and her big mop of thick dark hair had gone curly.“So I pinned it all up lovely,” says Louise, lifting her own hair up onto the top of her head to show, “and we put her eyeliner on. She used to stare at me doing my eyeliner and that’s how she learned to do it. It became our trademark.”The three women made Niamh up fully – painted nails and a face to turn heads: foundation and bronzer, blusher and highlighter on her cheeks.“It took me a while to touch her. I remember the guy saying in the morgue, ‘You can touch her’ and I said, ‘No! I can’t – I can’t touch her because I don’t want to feel how cold she is.’ Because she looked perfect, like she was just asleep.’“So it took me a while to touch her but when I did, I could hear her saying: ‘Make sure that’s perfect, make sure this is perfect.’ Maybe she was there, maybe she was saying it.“Maybe it wasn’t in my head but that’s what I done . . . I done all that for her.”Finally, Louise dressed the funeral-home room where Niamh would lie in repose with flowers and photographs, and examples of Niamh’s art. She was a talented artist.The deaths of four young women, who were close friends and lived close to each other, traumatised all of the families affected, but also the wider community in Athy and Carlow.“The people came flooding and it was manic,” says Louise. “It was really upsetting because people were touching her – her make-up was starting to come off. There were so many people coming.“There were people that I didn’t even know. At one stage, there was this guy come in and he was drunk and we thought he was going to fall in over her. He was just off the street.“I think he just saw the crowd come in but, you know like, it was very distressing. That was very distressing for Rachel. She just sat there through the whole thing. Eventually I got her out of there.”Before Niamh’s coffin was closed, her and Louise’s brother Kevin, who returned from Australia having only just got there after spending Christmas in Carlow, placed a pendant containing a family photograph.Louise, Rachel and Shane laid roses and dried flowers in the coffin, and a pouch of roll-your-own tobacco.Louise did not stay to see the coffin closed. At the funeral in the Church of the Holy Family in Askea, Carlow, four days after her sister’s death, she was on “autopilot”, as she describes it. The chief mourners were Niamh’s parents, Ber and Veronica, Louise, Kevin, Rachel and boyfriend Shane. Veronica Doyle lit a candle on the altar.Ber told the congregation of a remembered conversation with Niamh. Asked what quality she admired most, his daughter replied “kindness”, saying it was something Veronica had taught her.The music reflected Niamh’s loves – songs by Walking on Cars, James Vincent McMorrow and (a big musical love shared with Louise) the Coronas. They had talked about a Tommy Tiernan video , but that was one too far for the priest.After the funeral Mass, Niamh was buried in St Mary’s cemetery, beside her friend and fellow crash victim Gemma Nolan.The Polo, driven by Dayna Kearney, had veered on to the wrong side of the road, twisting on its axis as it went, and smashed, left side-on, into the front of a VW transit van.The van was driven by Przemyslaw Gorkowy (30) and his passenger Mariusz Wawrzos (35), both originally from Poland. They were on their way from Athy to Carlow where, by coincidence, Gorkowy lived barely a few metres from Gemma Nolan, one of the girls lying dead in the Polo, as Gorkowy and Wawrzos’ van burst into flames.Luckily for Gorkowy, he only had slight injuries. Wawrzos fared worse, spending time in hospital, but neither man suffered life-changing injuries.In the days after the crash, Gorkowy played the horror over in his mind. “I just keep seeing the accident again and again and again,” he told reporters. “I am lucky to be alive. I thought I was going to die. I cannot stop thinking about the girls.”Louise Doyle had other things to think about. Three weeks after the funeral, she was pregnant with Mikey, her now three-year-old son.“Everybody was saying ‘That’s great!’ but it wasn’t,” she remembers. “It was horrible. Not that I didn’t want the baby – I wanted it! But the whole experience of it was just traumatic.”Louise suffered intense bouts of morning sickness and she worried that her grief over Niamh’s death would somehow impact on the baby growing inside her.Her memories are blurred but she recalls very clearly having a photograph of Niamh present while she was giving birth.Eventually, Louise got through her depression unscathed, as did baby Mikey. But her relationship with her partner did not survive, linked she has no doubt to the trauma of the crash and Niamh’s death.About a year afterwards, Louise began to wonder what, if anything, was going on with the Garda investigation After such a high loss of life, gossipy rumours were inevitable: most centred around drink and drugs and speed – even though in time, all would be shown to be untrue.Neither of the drivers had been speeding and neither they, nor any of the passengers, had been drinking or taking drugs. No evidence, either forensic or visual, supported any suggestion of speeding.Eyewitness evidence, from Gorkowy and Wawrzos and the driver of a third vehicle travelling behind them, suggested the Polo’s speed was well below the 100kmh limit on the N78.The Garda Síochána has a system of family liaison officers (FLOs) whose role is to keep relatives informed about the progress of investigations after major events, such as a fatal road traffic crash, or a kidnapping or murder.Ber and Veronica Doyle were the primary point of contact for the FLO about the investigation into Niamh’s death. After some months, however, the parents found the contact too upsetting to continue.After that, Louise now had no way of knowing, even second-hand, what was going on.“I rang the gardaí and was told, oh yeah, just go up to your local court clerk and they’ll explain to you.”Frustrated, she went online and found Parc, the road safety group that supports families. Parc sent her leaflets and tutored her how to approach the Garda to ask for a FLO liaison.A liaison officer was eventually assigned to her but Louise found the service erratic. Emails were left unanswered for weeks and then at times only the day before a court sitting, not leaving her enough time to get off work.At times, some gardaí behaved, in her view, inappropriately (appearing slovenly dressed or smoking in public) or appearing at times to be more concerned for the accused rather than providing factual information sought by the victims.Early on, Louise went to a Garda station to ask questions. She was taken to an interview room and was disconcerted when she saw her image on display on on a TV-type monitor.“He would answer in a roundabout may, not specific. I was worried. . .” she recalls.She asked about the state of the VW Polo, amid rumours (which were accurate) that it had no NCT and was in some way defective (while mechanically sound, the car’s tyres were linked forensically to the cause of the crash) but could not get answers and felt the system supposed to assist her was in reality “cold and unresponsive”.A brighter moment occurred in early summer 2016 when Parc invited her and another family of a road fatality to meet then Garda commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan.The meeting took place inside the Garda Officers’ Club, the Victorian house in Garda Headquarters, and involved O’Sullivan the deputy commissioner, John Twomey a chief superintendent Susan Gray, the chair of Parc, and two members of a Mayo family who had lost a son, who had been run down late at night.O’Sullivan was very empathetic.“I found her easy to talk to and she listened,” says Louise. “She did comfort me because I got quite upset, talking about my sister.”O’Sullivan got up from her seat and sat beside Louise, putting her arm around her. While O’Sullivan stood by her officers – “You have to understand that guards are guards as well. They see an awful lot and they’ve been through an awful lot themselves,” she said, according to Louise – she nonetheless exuded empathy and understanding.The liaison service improved after the meeting, according to Louise.Regarding the judicial process, the alien, “other world” nature of the courtroom intimidated. Repeated adjournments occurred Louise thinks there were at least four) without, it seemed to her, much consideration for victim families who had to rearrange their personal or working lives, anxiety multiplied on top of raw emotion.When the case finally came to trial earlier this month, on July 10th, at Naas Circuit Criminal Court, Dayna Kearney cut a sad and lonely figure.Though supported by her family, she was dressed all in black, looked deeply numb, and was, said her defending barrister, attending counselling since the crash.Relatives of the four dead young women, including Louise and her ever-present friend and supporter, Mary Brennan, packed the court and listened attentively to the evidence.It suggested that inadequately inflated tyres, the front-left and rear-right in particular, caused the car wobble – or move like a snake, according Mariusz Wawrzos – and veer, or yaw, across the road and into the oncoming van.There was no obvious animus shown to Dayna Kearney – a feeling perhaps shared by the jury when, after a case lasting under three days, they acquitted her after about 20 minutes’ deliberation, deciding she was not to blame for any condition of the car that might have contributed to the tragedy.Ms Kearney could walk out the court a not guilty person, said the judge, but she would have to live with what had happened for the rest of her life. But so will everyone else affected.“My story comes from love,” says Louise. “It’s not to slate anybody – to slate the gardaí or the girl. It’s just a story that I’m telling. Niamh deserves it, 3½ years down the line.”Paying tribute to the two Garda FLOs present during the trial, she said they were attentive and helpful, one even phoning her the day after the verdict to see how she was coping.“That was lovely,” Louise said this week. “I had issues with them at the beginning and during the investigation but at the trial, they really came through.”That information may come out at an inquest. All she knows now is that her sister is in her grave but is also in Louise’s heart and her thoughts – every day and for always. Louise Doyle works in education and, with Carlow Regional Youth Service, has helped establish a bursary in memory of her sister.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanReuters Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the British prime minister Theresa May differed sharply on the Border backstop on Friday, with Mr Varadkar saying it was the UK’s responsibility to come up with a solution, while Ms May insisted it was up to the EU to overcome the logjam in the negotiations that threaten a “no deal” Brexit next March.At the same time in Brussels, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the British Brexit White Paper was largely unworkable and raised fundamental questions for the European Union. The statements by the Irish and British leaders and the EU’s Brexit chief on Friday demonstrated the extent of the difficulties over the backstop.Speaking in Cork, Mr Varadkar said the onus was on the British government “to bring forward proposals that are workable. We are very happy to talk about the wording of the backstop but the outcome must be the same – the outcome must be that in all circumstances that there won’t be a hard border between North and South.”“We are open to discussions on a backstop that achieves what we want it to achieve. But it must be better or the same as we have proposed,” Mr Varadkar said.But speaking in Belfast, where she was accompanied by members of the DUP, Ms May said: “It is now for the EU to respond, not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.”She challenged the EU to reply to last week’s British government White Paper that proposes a free trade area in goods and agricultural products between the UK and the EU. She said it represented a “coherent package” and a “significant development” in the British position.In Brussels, Mr Barnier acknowledged several positive aspects in the British White Paper, but said that is not compatible in important respects with fundamental EU values, notably the integrity of the single market, is largely unworkable, and conflicts with EU economic interest.Both the EU and the UK agreed last December that there should be a “backstop” – a guarantee of no hard border in Ireland even if the two sides cannot agree on a future trade and customs deal. But there has been no agreement on how it would work in practice, or how it can be translated into a legally enforceable text.The EU has said that without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement – threatening a “no-deal” Brexit where the UK crashes out of the EU next March.However, some Brussels sources say that with all sides indicating they are willing to consider a new wording for the backstop, a breakthrough would unlock the prospects for a deal on the withdrawal agreement.Meanwhile the Irish Aviation Authority has confirmed that flights from UK carriers will not be permitted to land in the Republic in the event of a hard Brexit unless a separate deal to cover aviation is struck with the UK government.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday that the Government was stepping up preparations for a disorderly Brexit, and warned “planes would not fly” in the event of a hard Brexit with no withdrawal agreement struck."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3571729.1532122688!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar proposes summer 2020 election date to martin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said an election in 2020 would prevent any instability overshadowing crucial stages of the Brexit negotiations. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA The  has learned that Mr Varadkar formally tabled the suggestion at a meeting in Co Kerry on Thursday evening.The Taoiseach and Mr Martin met to discuss the ongoing operation of the confidence-and-supply deal, which sees Fianna Fáil underpin the Fine Gael-led minority Government.They also discussed a number of other issues such as Brexit, the October budget, and expected referendums to be held on the same day as the presidential election later this year.The Taoiseach proposed that such an election timetable, with the country going to the polls in two years, would prevent the threat of an election and consequent instability overshadowing crucial stages of the Brexit negotiations, as well as the formal date of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.It is also understood Mr Varadkar said an agreed date would remove any efforts by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to blame each other for causing the election.Sources said that, during the talks in Killarney, Mr Martin stuck to his position that the review of the confidence-and-supply deal should take place after the budget. The deal says a review should take place at the “end of 2018”.Fianna Fáil sources said the passage of the October budget – on which talks between the two parties are due to begin by the end of the month – would guarantee “fiscal stability” for another year.Mr Martin has said the Government can remain in office even if there is no guarantee of an extended term, but has also spoken about the need for certainty through the next stages of the Brexit process.Others in the party have also said Fianna Fáil and Mr Martin have not spent years rebuilding their political reputations following the financial crash only to be blamed for causing an election at a time of national uncertainty.A withdrawal agreement between the UK and the European Union, including the so-called backstop to prevent a hard border even in a no-deal Brexit scenario, is due to be concluded by October.Brexit formally takes effect from March.The withdrawal agreement, if one is reached, is also expected to include a transition period which would see the UK staying in the single market and customs union, but being out of the EU, until the end of 2020.Mr Varadkar’s move would effectively mean the confidence-and-supply deal would be extended to take in a fourth budget. The current deal is due to be reviewed after the October budget this year, which is the third of the arrangement.An election in 2020 would also mean the current Dáil would run for over four years, just shy of the maximum five-year term.The next European Parliament elections and council elections, which will take place next spring, will come in advance of the general election.At their meeting, Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin agreed to talk again in early September, before the new Dáil term, which is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, September 18th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3571549.1532103044!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nord stream 2 gas pipeline from russia that s dividing europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPipe sections for  Nord Stream 2: Gazprom  plans to open the taps at the Russian end of the 1,200km-long pipeline in late 2019. Photograph: Jens Köhlerullstein bild via Getty ImagesLubmin is a picturesque resort on Germany’s Baltic Sea coast that boasts a long stretch of sandy beach bordered by soft dunes and a lush pine forest. Located a few hours north of Berlin, the town offers tourists a postcard version of seaside tranquillity. Or it would, were it not for the fleet of excavator barges that sails out from the local port every day, and the large building site hiding behind the pines.Both are part of a fiercely contentious project that has split Europe down the middle, and set Germany on a collision course with some of its closest allies. Out in the sea, the excavator barges are digging a massive underwater trench that runs in a straight line towards the building site on land. If all goes to plan, that trench will soon hold a pipeline filled with the most explosive commodity in European politics today: Russian gas.The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been in planning since 2015, and is due for completion in late 2019. Its defenders argue the project makes perfect commercial sense: the pipeline will connect the world’s biggest exporter of natural gas with the largest economy in Europe, doubling the capacity of the existing trans-Baltic link, Nord Stream 1, which has been operational since 2011.Together, the two pipelines will eventually be able to carry 110 billion cubic metres a year of natural gas, enough to meet almost a quarter of total demand across the EU.Critics regard the pipeline – and Germany’s role in it – as an act of betrayal and a geopolitical folly of the first order. Countries such as Poland and Ukraine have denounced it as a blatant attempt to marginalise their own gas pipelines – and a reckless move that will leave them and the rest of Europe at the mercy of Moscow. The European Commission is another opponent of Nord Stream, arguing the project undermines its push for greater energy independence and more ersified supplies.The most formidable adversary, however, sits in Washington. US president Donald Trump has made clear repeatedly that he wants to stop the €9.5 billion project – and that he is ready to impose tough sanctions to achieve that goal. Earlier this month, Trump launched a blistering attack on the new pipeline at the Nato summit in Brussels, warning that Germany had become “captive to Russia, because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia”.Kirsten Westphal, an energy analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, likens Nord Stream 2 to an “onion” – you peel away layer after layer of controversy only to discover that the next one is more contentious still. At its core, however, the pipeline poses a simple but crucial question: should the West trust Russia or not?“Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war in Ukraine have changed everything,” says Westphal. “For many people in the West, the idea that Russia is a dependable partner has gone. There is doubt: given all the geopolitical tensions, should we further expand our energy relationship with Russia? Should we make a bet, despite it all, to keep the channel open?”For reasons of history as well as naked economic self-interest, that question tends to find a different answer in Germany than in other European countries and the US. It is summed up neatly by Axel Vogt, the mayor of Lubmin and – like most locals – an enthusiastic backer of Nord Stream.“For us, Russia has always been a reliable business partner. And we don’t see any sign that this is changing despite all that is happening on the big political stage,” he says. “For Lubmin, Nord Stream means jobs, it means contracts for local businesses and it means more business taxes,” the mayor says.He adds that this affection for Russia goes beyond economic gain, and reflects ties forged in the time when Lubmin was part of communist East Germany. “Before reunification there was a very close relationship with Russia . . . and they want it to stay that way.”For now the project enjoys the official support of the German government (as well as the unconditional backing of the Kremlin). But the chorus of critics in Berlin, including inside the government, is growing ever louder.“Nord Stream 2 has ided the EU, and that cannot be in Germany’s national interest,” says Norbert Röttgen, a senior member of parliament for the ruling Christian Democratic Union. “The most important role that Germany has is to bring Europe together, not to ide it. But without Germany, this ision would not exist.”Earlier this year, German chancellor Angela Merkel signalled a subtle but important shift in official rhetoric. Nord Stream 2, she said, was “not just an economic project”. Political factors also had to be considered, she added, not least the need to preserve Ukraine’s status as a transit country for Russian gas.Kiev earns as much as $3 billion (€2.6 billion) in transit fees a year, according to Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state gas company, money the embattled government badly needs. The gas link also acts as motivation for the two countries to keep their military and political conflict from spinning out of control. When the gas stops flowing – as it did, briefly, in 2006 and 2009 – both sides stand to lose.Yet circumventing the Ukrainian network is precisely what Nord Stream is about, as Russian officials have made clear. The new pipeline will allow Russia to cut out the middleman for much of its westbound gas shipments – and to avoid the kind of disputes over payments and conditions with Kiev that have flared up in recent years. The fact that Ukraine’s pipelines are in urgent need of repair and investment provides an additional incentive.For the Russian-European consortium that is bearing the cost of the project, Nord Stream 2 is, above all, a promising investment. Unlike Nord Stream 1, which was a genuine Russian-European joint venture, the new pipeline will be owned entirely by Gazprom, the Russian gas group that controls Russia’s pipeline exports. Half the financing, however, is provided by five European companies: Uniper and Wintershall of Germany, Austria’s OMV, Engie of France and Royal Dutch Shell.Nord Stream’s backers are making a simple bet with potentially huge rewards. They know the pipeline will come on stream in 2019 just as supplies of European gas from the North Sea are starting to dwindle. The consortium estimates that even if overall gas demand is stable or declines slightly over the coming two decades, Europe will have to find an additional 120 billion cubic metres a year of natural gas by 2035. That gap will be filled by shipping large volumes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from countries such as Qatar and the US, or through pipelines from Russia.The looming gas shortfall has sparked a rush to build infrastructure, as suppliers jostle for position. Not far from Lubmin, on the other side of the Polish border, stands one of several new LNG terminals that have popped up on Europe’s coastline in recent years. Most are working well below capacity, reflecting the fact that pipeline gas is as much as 25 per cent cheaper than LNG.Some German business leaders and officials suspect that this is one of the core reasons for the opposition to Nord Stream 2. The US, they say, is simply trying to boost the commercial prospects of LNG. That was the central complaint in an open letter signed by a cross-party alliance of senior German lawmakers earlier this year.“It is not the job of the EU to keep potential competitors off the backs of US companies that want to market their . . . natural gas in Europe,” it said. “American liquid gas is welcome on the European gas market, but it has to face the competition just like others.”Why should German and European consumers and companies pay a premium for non-Russian gas? The obvious answer, say critics, is politics. Moscow, they argue, is engaged in a broad campaign to split the western alliance, destabilise European democracies and reassert Moscow’s influence in eastern Europe and the Baltics.One of the most potent weapons in that campaign is Russia’s control over energy resources – and Europe’s dependency on them. Concern over what might happen if Russia turns off the taps has weighed heavily on European minds for years. Nord Stream 2 will make those concerns even more acute.“Last year, Germany received slightly more than 40 per cent of its gas supplies from Gazprom. If we now double the capacity by way of Nord Stream 2, we will see another significant increase in supplies from Russia,” says Röttgen. “I believe this pushes us into a danger zone, both in terms of energy policy and foreign policy. We will lose some of our independence.”There is, he adds, another consideration: “The whole Putin system rests on two pillars: the military and the export of energy resources. By stabilising that second pillar, Germany is also stabilising the Putin regime.”Gazprom says that given that its newer gasfields are in Russia’s northwest, Nord Stream 2 will save 2,100km of transit compared with the Ukrainian route, and cut emissions by 61 per cent.Russia has also warned that US threats against it are illegal. “We believe that any sanctions against companies involved in an international project would not be legal,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this month. “This is an exclusively international, commercial project devoid of any political motives, based on the principles of commercial gain for the countries that participate in it.”The geopolitical case against Nord Stream 2 is made with particular intensity in eastern European capitals such as Warsaw, where fears over a Russian-German carve-up have a strong historical resonance. That sentiment was expressed in blunt terms by Radoslav Sikorski, the former Polish foreign minister, who likened the Nord Stream project to the 1939 deal between Hitler and Stalin to ide eastern Europe.In Berlin, however, officials prefer to point to a different historical antecedent: the Ostpolitik of Willy Brandt, the German chancellor who pushed for rapprochement with the Soviet bloc in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In economic terms, the policy gave rise to a “gas-for-pipes” deal between West Germany and the Soviet Union. Against fierce US opposition, the Germans agreed to ship steel and pipes to the USSR, in exchange for natural gas imports.The first Russian gas arrived in Germany in 1973, and imports rose steadily in the decades that followed, undisturbed by the cold war. For supporters of Nord Stream 2, that experience holds a crucial lesson. They see the gas relationship not as one of western dependence on Russia, but of mutual dependence between buyer and seller. Moscow needs western payments as much as the West needs Russian gas.“I see Nord Stream as a stabilising factor for the relationship between Russia and the West,” says Matthias Platzeck, a former leader of Germany’s Social Democratic party and now the president of the German-Russian Forum, a Berlin-based association designed to foster bilateral ties. “Even at the high point of the cold war the Russians always delivered their gas. Why should that change now? After all, they need the money.”As the political argument continues to rage, the project itself is making steady progress. Over the past two years, the consortium has amassed vast stockpiles of concrete-coated steel tubes, and deposited them at various points on the Baltic Sea. A few weeks from now, workers will begin welding the 12m-long pieces together at sea and lowering them into the water. With much of the investment already made, and all but one regulatory permit for the project granted, even critics admit that it will be hard to stop it now.As long as the project does not hit fresh political and technical turbulence, Gazprom is planning to open the taps at the Russian end of the 1,200km-long pipeline in late 2019. The impact at the other end, however, is already being felt.“In commercial terms, there is a case to be made for Nord Stream 2,” says Westphal. “In political terms, however, it is clear that Germany will pay a heavy price.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3571689.1532113095!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"analysis glimmer of hope at end of rocky brexit week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief EU negotiator for Brexit Michel Barnier: has gently demolished Theresa May’s Chequers proposal. Photograph: John ThysAFPGetty One of the most tumultuous fortnights in recent British political history ended on Friday with Theresa May doubling down on her opposition to the EU’s proposal for the Border backstop and Michel Barnier gently demolishing her Chequers proposal. But after a week at Westminster that saw politics descend into its most toxic, a close reading of what May and Barnier said on Friday may provide a soft glimmer of hope for the Brexit negotiations.As Conservative MPs exchanged angry barrages of invective across the Commons chamber during debates on Brexit-related Bills on Monday and Tuesday, veterans like Ken Clarke and Nicholas Soames said they had never seen the atmosphere within the party so poisonous. Remainers were incensed when the government accepted four amendments from Brexiteers around Jacob Rees-Mogg that appeared to undermine May’s Chequers proposal.In remarks that have been viewed more than a million times on social media, Anna Soubry said her fellow Conservatives who backed a hard Brexit admitted privately that their course would lead to the wholesale loss of manufacturing jobs.“What they have said in those private conversations is that the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs will be worth it to regain our country’s sovereignty. Tell that to the people who voted leave in my constituency. Nobody voted to be poorer, and nobody voted leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their jobs away from them,” she said.After the Brexiteers’ show of strength on Monday, Tory Remainers sought to flex their muscle on Tuesday when they tabled amendments to a trade Bill. The government whips were alarmed when an amendment to keep Britain in the European Medicines Agency was unexpectedly approved. But the rebels fell a handful of votes short in the vote on a more important amendment that could have kept Britain in a customs union.It emerged later that the whips were so nervous about the votes that they asked some Conservative MPs to break “pairing” arrangements with opposition MPs. Pairing is a longstanding parliamentary convention under which pairs of MPs on opposite sides agree not to vote if one is unable to come to Westminster, often because of illness, pregnancy, maternity leave or official ministerial engagements.When Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson, who has a three-week-old baby, discovered that Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis had broken their pair and voted in the two closest votes, she accused the government of cheating. Lewis and chief whip Julian Smith apologised, saying the breaking of the pair was the result of an honest mistake, an explanation repeated in the House by the prime minister on Wednesday.That story fell under suspicion, however, when it was reported that Smith had asked other Conservative MPs to break their pairs, although they had refused. On Friday, May was still resisting pressure to sack the chief whip but the episode reinforced the impression at Westminster of a government reduced to desperate measures to stay in control of Brexit.Boris Johnson used his resignation statement on Wednesday to attack the Chequers plan as Brexit in name only and to warn the prime minister that she must abandon it if she is to unite her party.In Belfast, May appeared to be shoring up her position with the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the central role the Border backstop has occupied in the Brexit negotiations. She said the EU’s backstop proposal would violate the Belfast Agreement’s principle of consent by creating a new border within the UK.“Under their proposal, Northern Ireland would be represented in trade negotiations and in the World Trade Organisation on tariffs by the European Commission, not its own national government.\u0026nbspThe economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal ‘third country’ customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept,” she said.The tone and context of May’s speech and its old-fashioned unionism, which sounded at times like the lord lieutenant’s welcoming speech at a Hillsborough tea party in 1955, left the impression of fighting talk. But the proposals she was attacking are not really part of the commission’s demands at all and Barnier sounded a conciliatory note as he offered to change the draft backstop proposal and to make regulatory checks as minimal as possible.As Westminster prepares to break up for the summer next week, the prime minister may have given herself room for manoeuvre on the backstop by erecting a straw man on customs and saying nothing about regulatory checks on either side of the Irish Sea.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They had been found guilty at Leeds Crown Court  of conspiracy to murder.The schoolboys hero-worshipped Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the American teenagers who carried out the infamous Columbine massacre in Colorado in 1999.Wyllie and Bolland, who were arrested when aged just 14, had devised their own plan for their school in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, drawing up a revenge “hit list” of students and teachers who had either bullied or wronged them. They had also downloaded bomb-making manuals off the internet and attempted to obtain guns and ammunition.Wyllie, who was given a 12-year jail term, was motivated by a far-Right “twisted ideology” and had set up a fake Instagram account with Nazi imagery.  Items including petrol, a bag of screws and a balaclava were found in an abandoned shed used by the boys as a hideawayIn a notebook recovered from the teenager’s home in October 2017, Wyllie apologised in advance for either committing “one of the worst atrocities in British history” or killing himself. He had kept a rucksack filled with screws, boards and flammable liquid at a secret hideout at Catterick Garrison. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, in lifting the order allowing the boys to be named, said in sentencing Wyllie: “You saw yourself as somebody outside the system, someone special. You modelled yourself on the apparent leader of the Columbine pair, Eric Harris and Alex Bolland was to take up the somewhat subsidiary role of Dylan Klebold.”Sentencing Bolland to a 10-year term, she said: “You were bullied over a period of years and it had a profound impact on you. The school authorities failed to take your complaints seriously and failed you badly.“But that was no justification for what you planned.”Wyllie wrote in his diary about his desire to carry out an attackOf their obsession on the ‘Dark Web’ with the Columbine massacre, the judge warned: “It is self evident that the unchecked consumption of such material on the internet is capable of poisoning young minds to such an extent that two disaffected murderers who killed themselves after ending the lives of innocent people can become the focus of adulation and imitation.”Both boys’ parents sat in the public gallery as sentencing was delivered. Only Bolland’s mother wept.According to Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, the bullying suffered by Bolland had motivated the plot, saying: “In other words, they were driven by a desire for revenge.”The planned attack came to the attention of teachers in September 2017 after a Snapchat conversation with a girl revealing the plot was brought to the attention of teachers. However, the pair were not arrested until October 2017, after Wyllie’s secret hideout was discovered by police.Wyllie was also convicted of the unlawful wounding of a teenage girl.In a statement after the boys were found guilty, North Yorkshire Police said it had instituted a review over its initial response to the allegations. Asst Chief Constable Phil Cain said: “We fully accept that standards of investigation and our initial responses to some of the incidents did not meet those standards that are expected of us.“A senior officer has since reviewed the issues and addressed these with a number of officers and staff.”Lone survivor of isolated Amazonian tribe captured on film for first time in decadesComment: Here it is: the exact moment that British politics lost the plot foreverComment: It\u0026#39s time to act to prevent children from accessing pornography onlineNeil Armstrong\u0026#39s personal collection of moon landing artefacts up for saleArchers cad returns: Anthony Head to play Robin Fairbrother in Radio 4 soapFacebook accused of censoring feminist campaign website concerned with transgender \u0026#34self-identification\u0026#34Goiat the brown bear facing explusion from Pyrenees after killing spree of horses and sheepLove Island, week 7 recap: Two love triangles, two walk-outs and a suitcase of groceriesThe three generations of one family killed in US \u0026#39duck boat\u0026#39 tragedyNine members of one family died in US lake tragedy, amid claims passengers were told not to worry about life jacketsFifty firefighters tackle Edmonton Tower block blaze in North London Donald Trump says American Football stars who protest anthem should be suspended for seasonMargaret Thatcher\u0026#39s famous Bruges speech was to have been much more critical before it was toned downMargaret Thatcher\u0026#39s teddy bears were so sought-after that officials had to turn down invitesGuides ditch the Hostess badge as girls to learn self-care, craftivism and mindfulness Denis Thatcher rejected Paul McCartney, David Attenborough and Paul Daniels for Tories\u0026#39 celebratory partyHamas spokesman says it has agreed Gaza ceasefire with Israel after day of bloodshedRussia fears leak of hypersonic missile secrets to West as security services searches space agencyAttack victim wins court review into closure of police station \u0026#39that saved his life\u0026#39Disney fires s of the Galaxy director James Gunn after old paedophilia jokes found on TwitterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"margaret thatchers famous bruges speech have much critical toned","story":"Margaret Thatcher\u0027s famous Bruges speech on the future of Europe was actually toned down and would have been much more critical, her private papers have shown for the first time. The 1988 speech, credited as a turning point towards Euroscepticism, had never been intended as the attack it was received as and personal references to Jacques Delors, then President of the European Commission, and “Euro waffle” were removed, drafts show. Furthermore, it has emerged that it was largely written by a Europhile, Hugh Thomas, who was “disappointed” with the reaction as it was seen as an an attack by Mrs Thatcher on the European project. The prime minister was in a fact an ardent supporter of the single...Register or log in to view this and other Politics articles.

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Vote Leave said the electoral commission’s\u0026nbspfindings were “wholly inaccurate”.Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who helped to coordinate the letter, said the watchdog\u0026nbspwas an “analogue regulator in a digital age” and warned that “dark money and dark data” could flood the system without reform.The suggested reforms include allowing the Electoral Commission to\u0026nbspimpose unlimited fines and to refer breaches to specialist police officers to investigate.MPs also called for campaigns to be forced\u0026nbspto declare their spending online, and outlined the need for tougher\u0026nbspregulation for digital political advertising – something the commission itself has backed.“Until these reforms are instituted, our democracy will remain susceptible to future abuses like these,” the letter said.Will the EU referendum be re-run after Vote Leave broke rules?Brexit referendum must be ‘rerun’ after Vote Leave fined for spendingIt’s a national embarrassment how bad Brits are at foreign languagesEU chief Brexit negotiator takes apart Theresa May’s new planMay insists chief whip not ‘trying to steal votes’ in ‘pairing’ row“Looking ahead, we cannot in good conscience have another election or referendum without ensuring our polls are free and fair.”Mr Kinnock said the democratic system was under attack from a mixture of foreign influence and abuses of the laws, describing the Vote Leave result as the “thin end of the wedge”.“The Electoral Commission is an analogue regulator in a digital age and is in desperate need of reform,” he said.“The commission’s fines are laughable and seen simply as the cost of doing business. I hope its recent call for reform will represent a fork in the road.“The government must act immediately otherwise abuse will continue and trust will decline – more dark money and dark data will flood the system and buy influence.”His concerns were echoed by Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, who said it was “fanciful” to suggest fines of £20,000 were enough to dissuade people from breaking the rules.She added: “I am not asking for a rerun of the referendum, but I think it strengthens the case for a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.”Kyle Taylor, director of the Fair Vote campaign group, which helped to organise the letter, said: “We cannot simply allow elections and referenda to be hijacked by illegal activity.“These elections decide the UK’s destiny and we the people deserve better.“Our politicians must now introduce measures to ensure this doesn’t\u0026nbsphappen again so we can be sure our elections are free and fair, and that the UK’s future actually reflects the true will of the people.”The Electoral Commission welcomed support from MPs\u0026nbspfor greater powers, as the organisation says it needs the tools\u0026nbspto regulate changes in political campaigning online.A spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We have been calling for parliament to make changes for over a decade and most recently set these out in detail in our digital campaigning report.“With the increasing use of online and targeted digital communications, action must be taken by the UK’s governments and parliaments, and by social media companies, to improve transparency for voters.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

Kosher meat requires all animals to be conscious at the point of slaughter.“We are checking whether the meat requirement can be linked to the place of residence,” he said, according to Austrian newspaper Wiener Zeitung.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesArab lawmakers stand up in protest during a Knesset session in Jerusalem.

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Schulmann\u0027s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his Teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote\u0026nbspthe Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles.

The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself.THERE’S no way of sugar-coating it — police just can’t be bothered investigating burglaries, along with much else.We’ve heard all the excuses: they’re hard to solve, we’re too short-staffed, “Tory cuts” and so on.But victim ­Izabela Siergiej gave them the criminal’s name, address and mugshot.

We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These were heavy things to say.Welsh dairy farmer Luke Winton went viral on Twitter last month after saying he had been threatened by another bunch of verbally abusive vegans.Ive had a number of threats on social media, and I know other farmers who have experienced the same thing, Luke tells Sun Online.It can be really scary. Recently, I had somebody threaten to come to the farm and shoot me - and Ive been called a rapist too.As a young person who has only been working in the industry a short time, I am terrified - and it seems the law isnt doing anything to help us.Im scared of vegans coming to the farm - and even stealing animals.They might think theyre saving an animal, but the truth is they might not know how to look after a cow properly, how to feed it or what injections it needs, says Luke.With the growing popularity of veganism, Luke says things have only been escalating - and he is constantly worried that somebody will come to his farm and attack him.Theres people trying to drive me out of my job. Some days, it makes you wonder why you do this - but Im trying not to let them stop me working.What activists such as Carbstrong would like to see is a move to a completely plant-based diet for everybody - something that would change the nature of farming and put many out of business.A spokesperson for The Vegan Society say they promote campaigns to help farmers transition to plant-based agriculture.Vegans rely on farmers for food and we want to work with farmers to see an end to animal agriculture as a whole, they say.However, farmers such as Luke Wilton remain concerned about their futures as more people adopt the diet.I see the vegans points, I really do, he says. But there is currently consumer demand for meat, eggs and dairy and we are providing the country with food.Its getting to the point now where I am getting used to the abuse.

The Government must now learn the lessons from this catastrophic failure as it faces the challenges of migration onto Universal Credit.The DWP will pay out the money over the coming months."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004209345301.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may should go home","story":"They did so by a huge margin. Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

Yes, the same offer already so over-generous it almost collapsed her Government.The Sun has never been more gloomy about the chance of a deal. There is nothing more Mrs May can compromise on.But Brussels is run by deluded bullies who apparently think they cannot lose.Martin Selmayr, the German who is effectively in charge, dislikes Britain and insists any deal must be punitive.The EU, while apparently negotiating with us, is also advising its members how to lure away our job-creating firms.Parliament, and its Remainers, must not be cowed. They must back Britain over Brussels. No Deal wasn’t our choice. But the EU is pushing us into it and telling its members to be prepared.Within eight months we must be fully ready too, economically and politically.THE huge surge in serious crime shames the supposed party of law and order.It is no coincidence murders, rapes, robberies and knife attacks are soaring with police numbers at a 36-year low.For years the Tories considered their necessary cuts to budgets safe enough. The evidence against is now irrefutable.But more cash is not the only answer.Many forces are appallingly led, obsessed with their image, with social media virtue-signalling and investigations driven by political correctness, all while ignoring the basics of keeping the public and their property safe.Home Secretary Sajid Javid must secure more money and reverse this horrific trend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite more sprouting up as the tournament went on, there’s been a noticeable difference.I think there is a reluctance to do so because shops may not want to feel they’re not being welcoming to members of the community, and perhaps Brexit has a part to play in that.Senior Labour figures have previously got in trouble for mocking the England flag.Emily Thornberry, one of Jeremy Corbyns closest allies, was forced to quit Ed Milibands Shadow Cabinet after posting a photo of a house in Rochester with St Georges flags flying outside."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421745708-e1532098297350.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"caravan bluebird penthouse high bickington devon taw valley","story":"The gleaming cabin complete with kitchen, bath and a wine cellar is a far cry from the abandoned wreck Ralph Westmacott stumbled upon three years ago.After discovering it on his father-in-laws farm in Devon, the innovater decided to give the old Bluebird a new lease of life and spent 2,000 man hours and several thousand pounds on turning it into a quirky holiday home with a 1950s theme.He sourced a vintage green and white kitchenette and other period decor to transform it into a charming bolthole that takes guests back to the halcyon days of post-war Hi-de-Hi-style holidays.It comes with a double bed, a bathroom and central heating that is powered by a biomass boiler.The walls are painted white and green, and the floor has a checked pattern in the same two colours.Outside is a unique hot tub that is set in the chassis of an old Land Rover.The caravan, called the Bluebird Penthouse, is located on Ralphs father-in-laws farm at High Bickington in north Devon which has stunning views over the Taw Valley.The incredible transformation cost Ralph several thousand pounds but he is now recouping the investment as the caravan is fully booked for the rest of the summer at £130 a night.There is also a service fee of £49, which goes towards covering cleaning costs in preparation for the next guests.Ralph said he and his wife Lucy are delighted with how business is going, even if it means they cant stay in the caravan themselves.He said: The whole idea started when my father-in-law was talking about scrapping an old caravan that had been wasting away on his farm.I thought it seemed pretty cool and eventually managed to convince him to allow me to restore it.It was a lot of work and I lost count of how many hours I put into it somewhere around the 2,000 hour stage.The hot tub was similar really, it was an old farm Land Rover that had not been used for years and was just rusting away.With a bit of clever design we managed to use it as the foundation for a hot tub, which has turned out to be an incredibly popular feature.We consciously didnt do too much work to the exterior, because the ever so slightly tired look helps it to blend into the hillside.Its taken off hugely this year, just getting bigger and bigger and were all delighted with how its going."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict0002431013921.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"yellowstone park state emergency supervolcano erupt latest","story":"In this terrifying video, a huge, steam-spewing fissure is visible on a volcano in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, near inspiration point and hidden falls.Park officials have since closed off two areas of the park, citing concern for peoples safety.The National Park Service said that its possible the crack could have been caused by regular seismic activity, but they arent sure of the exact causes and have launched an investigation.Superintendent David Vela said: Human safety is our number one priority, and with an abundance of caution we are temporarily closing this area until we can properly asses the situation.Rangers have not confirmed when the areas with reopen, but they are currently completing a risk assessment.Grand Teton National Park is around seven miles away from Yellowstone National Park and the Yellowstone supervolcano.If both volcanoes were to erupt, it could cause a massive explosion capable of wiping of millions of people.Earlier this year and abnormal river of lava was found underneath the Yellowstone supervolcano -

She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what does the future hold for the tribes in the face of deforestation and the growing use of technology?The Sentinelese are an uncontacted tribe living on North Sentinal Island, one of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean.They reject all contact with outsiders, according to Survival International, and are thought to have inhabited the island for nearly 60,000 years.They are known to throw arrows at low flying aircraft and after the 2004 Tsunami a photo showed one aiming an arrow at an emergency helicopter.The Kawahiva - a small group of uncontacted Indians living in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest - have survived numerous genocidal attacks.Survival International say very little is known about them, because they have no peaceful contact with outsiders.They live a nomadic lifestle - a result of violence and the destruction of their forest home.The Jarawas are an indigenous people of the Andaman Islands in India.They face many threats including a road built through their territory which brings thousands tourists into their land.They have largely shunned interaction with outsiders.The Dani tribe live in the highlands of Western New Guinea, Indonesia.They were unwittingly discovered by American philanthropist, Richard Archbold, after an expedition in 1938.They are well known for their unique practice of self-mutilation which involves cutting off the top part of their fingers when a loved one dies.The Lacandón people live in the Lacandon jungle in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.In 2015 there were less than 300 members remaining and they are direct descendants of the ancient Maya civilization.They cut all possible contact from the outside world and called themselves Hack Winik, meaning True People.The Mashco Piro - who live in the jungle in Peru - had historically rejected outsiders.But in 2015 they started to appear in populated areas.They are said to have been displaced by illegal loggers, gold miners and oil companies, as well as drug traffickers."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-ireland-border_4365627.jpg?20180719082223 ","title":"can the pm remould her brexit deal on the potters wheel in fermanagh","story":"No one wants a hard border, but six months from Brexit, there is no plan in place to prevent one.In his resignation statement, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the House of Commons the Irish border had become \"politically charged\".He added that the problem of the land boundary \"had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble\".When they needed agreement last December, the UK and EU found a solution - a safety net they call \"the backstop\".:: Northern Ireland \u0027unsupportive\u0027 of \u0027no deal\u0027 Brexit The EU understood it meant that, in the event of no deal, Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union.The issue is further complicated by the fact that most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.But the DUP campaigned to leave, their MPs vote with the Brexiteers, and the prime minister needs them right now.It is not by coincidence that Mrs May\u0027s visit will take in Fermanagh - Arlene Foster\u0027s own Stormont constituency.If \"no deal\" produces a hard border, it will not be better than a \"bad deal\" for people living here."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-now-thats-jonathan-isaby_4366423.jpg?20180719223257 ","title":"now thats what i call music is the soundtrack to my life","story":"Now 10, released in time for Christmas 1987, was the first one that I bought brand new - featuring the likes of China In Your Hand by T\u0027Pau, Love In The First Degree by Bananarama and Alone by Heart.And come Easter 1988, Now 11 hit the shelves, enabling me to add tracks like I Should Be So Lucky by Kylie Minogue and the Pet Shop Boys\u0027 brilliant cover of Always On My Mind to my collection.And just in time for the school summer holidays, I\u0027d purchased Now 12, including such gems as Mary\u0027s Prayer by Danny Wilson and I Think We\u0027re Alone Now by Tiffany.You get the picture.

He is Argentina\u0027s best open water swimmer.Jackie joined for the last 10 minutes and was magnificent. I was thoroughly impressed by her style and perseverance.She swam the longest Channel crossing at 28 hours and 44 minutes when she was 56 years old, and in my view, the person who swims slowest is the greatest as they need the most grit and are immersed in the cold for longest.After the swim we transferred from the Aquila to the Princess speed boat to rush to Plymouth for the lord mayor\u0027s tea reception to welcome me home.The sea state was slight to moderate, but combined with a force-three wind, there was kitchen cutlery and crockery flying everywhere and several people on the verge of being seasick over the side.The nasty chop in the sea meant the transfer nearly ended with several crew members overboard, with many wet feet and a couple of green faces.We are now all safely aboard the Princess and are speeding home to Plymouth ready for an afternoon of celebration.Aquila is sailing behind us and will take several hours to reach harbour. Me and the crew will be using the Princess for the next few days to continue swimming, as it is much faster.:: Day eight - 5.1 miles (8.3km)Especially large jellyfish were out on force this morning, with two new species spotted that looked particularly nasty.Another first for today was a shark sighting! We are unsure of the species, but the crew saw its fin pointing out the water about 30m from the starboard side (luckily opposite to me).Thankfully, it didn\u0027t seem to spot or be interested in me so we kept going and the crew only told me once I was out.I have developed a cold so the morning\u0027s swim was tough going. I am resting as much as I can now before the weekend, which sees me and the crew attending events in my hometown of Plymouth, so we have a jam-packed schedule.On our way back for our last day in Falmouth now.:: Day seven - 5.75 miles (9.26km)I was joined by my first guest swimmer today!Chris Coleman, who is deputy head of Taunton School, is a Channel relay swimmer and has championed open water swimming with his pupils.We are hoping some of the pupils might join us further into the journey.There was another sunfish sighting today, while some dolphins came right up to our boat\u0027s hull.For now, we are continuing with a strategy of one swim a day.:: Day six - 5.3 miles (8.5km)The morning swim today was great.I smashed out 5.3 miles (8.5km) and the plan is for this to be the only swim of the day.There were no wildlife spots this morning and only a very small number of jellyfish, but there were lots of fishing boats out that I had to navigate around.We are now motoring on towards Falmouth for a bit of a recovery day after all the excitement of meeting Prince Charles on Monday.:: Day five - 6.6 miles (10.6km)Met Prince Charles today - in my shorts and flip flops.I was a keynote speaker at the Ocean Plastics Solutions Day at St Agnes in Cornwall, organised by Surfers Against Sewage.The Prince of Wales listened attentively as I explained what we were doing, and why it is important to make sure the oceans are as clean as they can be, as we battle problems like single use plastics. Not ideal conditions today - there were lots of jellfyfish blooms and rain squalls along the way.Yesterday\u0027s final swim was a disappointment. We picked the wrong current to follow around the last section of The Lizard - the most southerly point in Great Britain - so after one hour and 20 minutes of hard graft, I\u0027d made virtually no progress.After the poor swim, we anchored out at sea so we could catch an early tide this morning. However, we finally found success! Our craft\u0027s skipper, Stephen Praetorius, and I managed to locate the missing offshore current, which meant I could fly 3.4 miles (5.5km) in one hour and 20 minutes.We are now back on track and we are definitely one happy crew again. My support vessel Aquila has travelled to Falmouth for much needed water and supplies. We are now down to our emergency water rations.I went out again this evening and swam straight into a good current, swimming 3.2 miles (5.1km).A pod of four dolphins including two young ones joined me for a few minutes, and were only metres away.I could hear their clicking under the surface.:: Day four - 4 miles (6.5km)Today was a crucial day for the first week of The Long Swim.I rounded Lizard Point, the most southerly point in Great Britain and a place renowned for its treacherous waters.Although things appeared calm on the surface, they were rather more turbulent underneath.Whirlpools and eddies caused an ols and eddies caused an up-swelling of cold water. The temperature when the swim began was 16C (61F), and when I came out of the water after 79 minutes it had dropped to 12C (54F).Although our images show me swimming straight towards the rocks, the tide was actually perpendicular, pushing me 90 degrees sideways.Big up to skipper Stephen Praetorius, who navigated our craft and me safely through on the morning spring tide.I have never experienced such strong currents. It was like swimming in a flooding river.This evening swim then started well - we saw pods of dolphins and a sunfish - but after that it didn\u0027t go to plan. I started swimming on the wrong current, which made me swim even slower than I would have done if there\u0027d been no current at all.After struggling against counter-eddies for nearly an hour and a half I had covered only a couple of kms.I made the call to stop and try again first thing in the morning - a move we had not planned. This means we couldn\u0027t motor to Falmouth for the evening to replace our water, power and get food. We have now run out of water and are on our emergency supply bottles, having anchored in the small village of Coverack.The plan for tomorrow is to do a swim early to make up for the lost time.:: Day three - 9 miles (14.5km)Glassy sea on a beautiful Saturday in Mounts Bay, with a perfect spring tide current, which helped propel me toward Lizard Point.The crew continued fine-tuning the jellyfish watch and are now on a rota. It is difficult to keep focus after 20 minutes and very easy to be hypnotised by the motion of the sea and you glaze over in the glare. I have an active mind while swimming and I like to keep track of my thoughts. Occasionally I stop to shout a word or phrase for the crew to write down - something to trigger my memory later.The stream of consciousness can get quite interesting!Today was the first time we have encountered big ships - there was a row of three oil tankers anchored on the eastern end of the bay. Now heading back to Mullion Cove again, we will be heading back out in the late afternoon to pick up the GPS point for the evening swim.Overall, a phenomenal morning swim and it feels as though we are banking kilometres. All happy on board. I am back in the water this evening and hopefully this will take us to the edge of Lizard Point.This evening was all about the Lizard. Do we shoot it tonight, making the best that the spring tide can give, or do we take a measured approach and leave it for the morning?Today\u0027s swim was shorter, but fast, sometimes I was swimming at over four knots - that\u0027s 7.2 kph.Overall another happy day, as we say goodbye to Mounts Bay.:: Day two - 8 miles (12.8km) Another two good sessions in the morning and evening, in very fair conditions. I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member.I was stung on my arms, which we treated with vinegar after I got out of the water - it made me smell of fish and chips!We ended up setting up a jellyfish watch, with spotters armed with whistles.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am. :: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top secret plans how","story":"NewsopinionRevealed: the top secret plans of how to prepare for a \u0027No Deal\u0027 BrexitYou\u0027re gonna need a bigger boat\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist12:50, 20 JUL 2018Updated13:18, 20 JUL 2018Newsopinion\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailToday, Theresa May will tell the European Union to give us a Brexit deal or else, and in the weeks to come she will be telling the country exactly what \u0027or else\u0027 means.  Every week, there will be a detailed bundle of advice published for citizens, consumers and companies about what they need to do to prepare for March 29, 2019, when Britain will cease to be a member of the EU and be flicked, like an unwanted beer mat, off Beachy Head into the arms of all those international trade deals we don\u0027t have.  We can only hope a civil servant has had the sense to write \u0027DON\u0027T PANIC!\u0027 on the cover. Of course they won\u0027t be necessary if the EU gives in and does what Jacob Rees-Mogg wants. And if they don\u0027t, there\u0027s a strong chance they\u0027ll just extend the Article 50 deadline, which would be useful if the headbangers hadn\u0027t insisted on legislation that named March 29 as B-Day. So what will they say, these worst-case-scenario papers that have suddenly become, with eight months to go, the increasingly-likely-scenario plan?  Even the most cautious types could tell you it\u0027ll mean a \u0026pound5.50 driving permit at Dover, a shortage of cucumbers and longer queues at airports. But the full truth is, in a post-Brexpocalypse world, it\u0027ll involve a lot of currently-unforeseen consequences of having made the EU an offer it can very easily refuse.  Dark and unpleasant things like this: 1. Cliff Richard will lose his human rights   Which will be annoying, as he\u0027s just spent around \u0026pound4million trying to improve them for people accused of terrible things. If we Brexit without copying the EU\u0027s Charter of Fundamental Rights, we\u0027ll lose rules on data protection, human trafficking, disability rights, equal pay and workplace discrimination, as well as the rights of victims of crime.  We\u0027ll still have the European Court of Human Rights, which is not part of the EU, but it\u0027ll take a six-figure sum and several years to take any complaints to it, so unless you\u0027re as rich as Cliff the chances are the ECHR will be as much use as a unicorn\u0027s nosebag. The government says all current laws we have as a result of the EU will remain in UK law - however, there\u0027s nothing to stop any future Parliament repealing them in the name of, say, trade deals with tyrants. 2. All medicine will be 30-year-old cough syrup from the back of the medicine cabinet   Goodbye, radioactive isotopes used in MRI scanners. So long, EU-regulated cancer medication, clinical trials and any confidence you currently have that a packet of paracetamol from the garage definitely does not include Spice. Hello again to whatever you can find in an exploration of the furthest reaches of your bathroom storage. Need opioids because mum broke her arm? Tixylix. Need an appendix removed? Vicks Vapour Rub, if you can get the lid off. And in the case of childbirth, you can forget a nurse, midwife or doctor and place your faith instead in the pain-killing, life-saving properties of a dusty packet of Strepsils.  You can say Oh, lime cordial! Delicious! all you please, but it has already been announced that from March next year and in the absence of a deal the UK authorities will no longer be able to engage with the EU medicine regulator.  May I suggest you start stockpiling Germolene. You are going to need it. 3. Kent will fill up with lorries and empty of people   Perhaps you don\u0027t live in Kent and couldn\u0027t care less. But 1,554,600 people do, and when the most rebellious county in Britain (a regicide, two peasant revolts, a saint who told a king to bog off and the woman who sparked schism in the church, and you\u0027re welcome) realises it has become a lorry park for an entire national motorway network they will up sticks and cross the Medway in droves.  Still not bothered? Ask yourselves this. Would 1.5m brown people suddenly arriving on the mainland be able to find a home, job and schools, and does the fact the Kentish ones are a mix of brown, white, chavvy, privileged, light-fingered and small-minded really make much difference to the answer? They\u0027re not all Pop Larkin, you know. And Catherine Zeta Jones was Welsh. 4. The end of the rule of law   WAIT WHAT.  Sorry, but yes. It\u0027s already begun. Law in this country is built upon convention and precedent, and in the past two years the convention that the Prime Minister is in charge of things has been tossed out of the window while precedent has been offered up like a sacrificial chicken on the altar of The People Voted For A Thing There Is No Precedent For.   We are now in a situation where thousands march because a Far Right idiot who admitted breaking the law, and imperilled the course of justice for everyone, is in in jail for it. We live in a land where seagulls are murdered for chips, children leave the house tooled up and we are perhaps 5 minutes away from someone claiming that the freedom to commit sexual assault is a human right.  When this all goes tits up next year the chances are your home will become your castle. Check the locks, barricade the windows, figure out your escape routes. If you\u0027ve got a garden, dig a bunker, and if you\u0027re near water build an ark. Once financial passporting is no longer allowed, and the City collapses, the countryside will be filled with currency and commodity traders roaming wild in their pink trousers, gorging on the proletariat while Jacob Rees-Mogg shepherds them along in an armoured Bentley with a Remainer stuck in the grille.   And perhaps you think this is all so much Remoaner panic, except for two things. Firstly, the government is about to drip-feed you a weekly diet of very similar, if worded differently, predictions. And secondly there are reports that Vladimir Putin has given a Far Right paramilitary motorbike gang in Slovakia some of his tanks. The Night Wolves paramilitaries and their friends say these are merely decommissioned vehicles hired for a new museum. But these guys are said to admire Stalin and fought on the pro-Russian side in Ukraine, where the US says they attacked the country\u0027s navy HQ.  Ukraine, incidentally, is the same place where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed by a Russian missile in 2014, which Putin\u0027s militia claimed credit for until they realised it was not a military transport but a holiday flight with 298 civilians on board.  So that\u0027s pro-Russian paramilitaries with Russian military kit inside the EU borders, but it\u0027s just for a museum honest even though they have a history of it actually being for killing.  As we head down the Brexit plughole there may yet be a last-minute rescue by way of an extension, a general election, or a people\u0027s vote. But the portents are bad - Mogg is no longer funny and there are sharks everywhere.  There is however one bright, shining light on the horizon, and that is if civilised society collapses it will be acceptable and indeed vital for the nation\u0027s recovery for a crew of plucky survivors to pull together, hunt down Boris Johnson, shave his head and dip him repeatedly in the nearest rancid pile of uncollected domestic refuse while telling him they will stop just as soon as he produces a Brexit dividend.  Which is something to look forward to. Pity the electricity will have been off for months by that point and no-one will be able to livetweet it, but beggars can\u0027t be choosers. As we are all about to find out.

Labour accused Government of “penalising ill people” by failing to inform them of entitlement after moving to the all-in-one benefit. Helen Goodman blasted the Department for Work and Pens\u0026shyions and called on Employment Minister Alok Sharma for refunds. Fines can be as high as \u0026pound100 per prescription. The MP said: “This is the minister’s fault. “They should not penalise ill people because of their shambolic rollout of Universal Credit.”  Not all claimants qualify for free prescriptions and eligibility can change based on how much they earned in a given assessment period. But there is no automatic system to tell them whether they qualify. Even ticking the wrong box on the form can lead to a fine.

(Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe ‘chat and cut’ and ‘sorry, sorry, sorry’ have been named as some of the underhand techniques Brits are using to jump queues. Researchers found more than one in four admit to cutting in front of someone in a line, with the ‘open invitation’ method – when a gap opens up which you can pretend you thought was the end of the line - the most popular. Others rely on the ‘chat and cut’ technique to push in, which involves finding someone in the queue to start a conversation with and staying at that spot in the line. Pretending to be late so others let you in ahead of them and apologising in a fluster are also popular among Brits.  Some even admit to heading to the front of the queue under the guise of having a quick question to ask a member of staff. The TripAdvisor research also found the British love of queuing is in sharp decline among the nation’s youth. Generation Z (18-24 year-olds) are more than twice as likely to push in front in a queue than Baby Boomers.  And despite more than two thirds of Baby Boomers saying they consider queue jumping the height of bad manners, just 28 per cent of Gen Z think the same. Baby Boomers are also twice as likely to confront a queue jumper in the act than they are to let it slide (31% v 15%). This is in stark contrast to Gen Z, with more than a third of 18-24 year olds taking a ‘no worries’ attitude to someone cutting in front of them compared to only a quarter who would confront the queue jumper. Hayley Coleman, serial queue jumper and TripAdvisor spokesperson said: “The British love of queuing is a clich\u0026eacute we all know, but in truth most of us hate being stuck in a queue – yet we spend two to three days a year waiting in line. “So, if you want to save time and skip a queue this summer, the message is simple: book online, and in advance.  “This is easier to do than many people think - TripAdvisor has more than 100,000 experiences, tours and activities available to book online – and you’ll even avoid the wrath of the dreaded hard stare from your fellow queuers.” With peak holiday season in full swing, and the hot weather likely to boost visitor numbers to UK attractions, the prospect of being caught in the middle of an awkward queue confrontation is greater than ever. Yet, only one in five attraction visitors heed advice to book ahead – even though many of the busiest attractions offer Skip The Line ticket options that can be booked in advance and which allow you to skip the queues altogether.  For example, the Coca-Cola London Eye, where queues can exceed one hour during peak times, offers a Skip The Line ticket option that lets you bypass the queues and can be booked on TripAdvisor for as little as \u0026pound33.30. Similar ticket options are available across the UK at sites like Warwick Castle, Spinnaker Tower and Edinburgh Castle. In a field test of the research findings, TripAdvisor set up a social experiment – filming YouTuber Zac Alsop undercover at attraction queues around the country.

If only we’d all take the time out to look at them, says Sir David Attenborough. The veteran broadcaster is backing the Big Butterfly Count, which launched on Friday and urges us all to spend the next three weeks recording the butterflies we spy in our gardens and further afield. Organised by Butterfly Conservation and sponsored by B\u0026ampQ, the count asks us all to record 17 species of common butterflies and two day-flying moths, not only to safeguard our own mental health, but to help protect the species in the future.   You can sign up here . But first, to help you take flight, here are ten common – and rarer – butterflies to watch out for.  Common British butterflies  Brimstone      The male is the only large, lemon-yellow butterfly in the UK, the female is cream-coloured. Less likely to see them in Scotland and N.Ireland.  The Speckled Wood      With dark brown wings speckled with cream dots, they have spread to East Anglia, the Midlands and the North in recent years due to climate change.  The Comma      Looking almost ragged, its orange and brown wings are heavily scalloped. When its wings are shut you’ll see a silvery comma shape on the underside.  The Holly Blue   The most common blue butterfly in woods and gardens. Unlike the Common Blue it has no orange spots on the underside of its wings. It is widespread in the south but spreading north.  Peacock      With reddish–purple wings with large eye-spot patterns, this is one of the UK’s most familiar butterflies.  The Small Tortoiseshell   With orange wings and black spots this is one of the most recognisable of all. It flies fast in bright sunshine but easy to spot when feeding.  The Large White      Our largest pure white butterfly, it’s a pest for cabbage growers, devouring the vegetable. Found throughout the UK.  Red Admiral      A large black butterfly with streaks of orange red and white spots, you can spot these into November and even over the winter months. Rarer butterflies  The Swallowtail      Pale yellow and black, with electric blue and a red spot on its hindwings, this is our largest native butterfly. The British race is the subspecies, britannicus, which you will find only in the fens of the Norfolk Broads.

Disturbing images show the boiling husky collapsed on the ground after being freed from the sweltering car as temperatures reached 29 degrees outside yesterday. Incredibly when the dog\u0027s owners returned they couldn\u0027t see what they had done wrong, a witness claimed. A parking ticket on the car led those who discovered the distressed dog to believe that it had been there for around two hours. Temperatures inside a locked car can soar to almost double in a matter of hours, and can be lethal to dogs .  Samantha Claire Hardwidge stumbled upon the boiling husky in Swindon, Wiltshire, with a fellow colleague and shared the pictures online yesterday.  Taking to Facebook , Samatha wrote: Shout out to the owners of this car who felt it appropriate to leave their husky in their car.  The parking ticket shows them arriving at 10:47am. The dog was found by me and my colleague in a poor state at 12:35pm - with the parking ticket showing they could park until 1:46pm.  The police were called and removed the dog from the car. The owners arrived back at the car and proceeded to shout and swear that they didn\u0027t see what the problem is. The owners refused to take the dog to the vets to be checked despite it being visibly distressed from being in the car for so long. The owners refused to pass their details to the police. The dog was seized so it could be checked by a vet. The photographs show the distressed husky inside the car, and later lying on the ground on it\u0027s side with a water bowl beside it.  The post has received more than 15,000 shares and nearly 5000 comments from furious social media users. Kay Sell said: Disgusting, the owners should be locked in the car for several hours and then go to jail if they are still alive. Susan Barker said: Bad enough to lock any creature in a car with this heat, let alone a husky type with their thick underfur. Morons. Ted Davis added: Stupid is not what I would say, so cruel. Bloody idiots. While Valerie Lorne said simply: Disgusting behaviour. Speaking to a local paper, a spokeswoman from Wiltshire Police said yesterday: When we arrived the dog was heavily panting and not responding. The window was slightly open but the dog was obviously in distress.

Kayleigh Snaith, now 16, has faced cruel comments from strangers and classmates telling her she’s ruined her life, would never achieve at school and even branding her ‘disgusting’. However with the unfailing encouragement from her parents and the added motivation of providing a good life for her little girl, Kayleigh has raised a happy, healthy tot and completed seven GCSEs. And Kayleigh, who is due to study music at college from September, couldn’t imagine a better way to celebrate finishing school than getting glammed up with her daughter. While the toddler couldn’t attend the party with her mum, Kayleigh bought Harley a gorgeous white lace dress and the adorable pair posed for photos before driving to prom together on July 3.  Kayleigh, who lives with her parents in Stanley, Co Durham, said: “I wanted to take Harley to my prom and get her all dressed up to show her that she is a princess in my eyes – and always will be. “I hope she grows up knowing that she deserves the best and never to settle for anything or anyone that makes her unhappy. She should be treated with love and care. “I also wanted to show everyone else who thought I would never make it through school being a young mum that I did it. Here I am celebrating finishing school with my daughter. “I wanted everyone to see that Harley comes first. Nothing is just about me anymore, it’s about me and Harley. I wanted her to feel as beautiful and loved as I did on my prom day. Kayleigh kept her pregnancy secret for six months as she was terrified how her parents Sharon Snaith, 48, and Tommy Snaith, 53, would react. But the schoolgirl’s stunned mum and dad promised to support Kayleigh no matter what and set about frantically preparing their house for their new granddaughter Harley Snaith.  The young mum admitted it hasn’t been easy. She said: When Harley was a newborn I would be up through the night with her, sometimes for two or three hours if she didn’t settle, and then I would go to school. “At home I’m a mother and an adult to my child but then in school I was suddenly a student, a child there to learn. “I was so tired all the time and I would have people telling me I was disgusting, that I’d ruined my life, I’d never be a good mum and I’d never achieve anything in life. It was really hard. “But knowing Harley was at home waiting for me and that I was working for our future really motivated me. All the tiredness was worth it to build the best possible life for my daughter. Kayleigh said that getting through GCSEs was tough. She admitted she was terrified that she wouldn’t be able to do them while raising Harley.  “I remember sitting and crying because I was worried I would fail and I wouldn’t be able to get a job and do the best I could for Harley she told. It was a lot of pressure. “But Harley inspired me to keep going and gave me the big push I needed. I\u0027ve worked really hard and I’m looking forward to getting my results in August. “I hope by sharing the pictures from my prom, other young mums and their parents will realise that having a baby in your teens isn’t the end of the world. “No matter what people tell you or think of you, if you push yourself and work hard you can still achieve all of your life goals. “Yes, it is a struggle and it’s life changing but being a new mum always is. There are mums in their twenties and thirties who find it scary. Your age doesn’t define whether or not you’re a good mum. “You learn to ignore the comments. Harley is a beautiful, cheeky and happy little girl. She is a ray of sunshine and I’m proud to be her mum. I’ll never regret having her or be ashamed.”  When she skipped her period and started feeling movement in her stomach, Kayleigh knew she was pregnant but struggled to share the news with her family. After many sleepless nights scared about what a baby might mean for her future, Kayleigh spoke to her head of year who called in her mum. During her pregnancy, the mum-of-one attended school part time and returned full time just four weeks after Harley was born on May 6, 2016, weighing 6lbs 13oz. Kayleigh admits that raising a baby and finishing school has been difficult and says she couldn’t have done it without the incredible support and parenting tips from her mum and dad. While it has been tough, Kayleigh says Harley has made her a better and happier person and hopes sharing her experience will make society more accepting of young mums.  Kayleigh said: “As soon as I missed my period I suspected I was pregnant but I told myself that it happens to some girls. “When I started feeling movement in my stomach it was obvious what was going on but I was terrified of telling my mum and dad. “All these things go through your head. I was worried they would kick me out or make me get rid of her. I spent so many nights awake worrying about it, I couldn’t focus on anything else. “When I started to get a bit of a bump I knew I couldn’t keep it secret anymore so I asked my head of year to call in my mum. I couldn’t stop crying when I told her, I was so scared. “My mum was really shocked but I remember her saying ‘if you want to keep this child, we will support you and do everything we can for you’. “She even offered to adopt the baby but I wanted to raise her. My dad was a bit more upset, it took him longer to adjust. I’m his little girl and it was hard for him. “But they have both been amazing, they’re so supportive. They got everything ready for Harley’s arrival in three months. It was manic but we just about scraped through. “They’re always trying to better me as a parent and give me really great advice. I am so lucky, I couldn’t have got through all of this without them.

Passengers are seen crying and visibly shaken in footage posted online by Israeli model and socialite Hofit Golan.

But before Kate and Meghan there was Fergie and Diana - the original \u0027Merry Wives of Windsor\u0027. Both young twenty-something women when they were hurled into royal life - and the limelight - the Duchess of York and the Princess of Wales had a clear rapport in the early years of their marriages. They even holidayed together and were infamously pictured at Ascot poking Fergie\u0027s schoolfriend Lulu in the bottom with their umbrellas.  Fergie has frequently described Diana as her best friend and has often spoken of her devastation at her tragic death, made all the more painful as the two were not on speaking on terms at the time. The Duchess of York never got to reconcile with her friend. Their fall-out was touched on in Fergie\u0027s tell-all book, Finding Sarah.  Diana was one of the quickest wits I knew nobody made me laugh like she did, she wrote. We took vacations together with our children. Sadly, at the end [of the Princess’s life] we hadn\u0027t spoken for a year, although I never knew the reason, except that once Diana got something in her head it stuck there for a while.

Victoria Williams was “disgusted and sickened when she found out an image of her daughter was circulating on Snapchat with the words ‘RIP Seren’. It said: “This gorgeous, independent, strong and loving girl took her own life due to years of depression and serious bullying. “I have been her friend for so long and her family and I are absolutely heartbroken. “Seren meant the most to all of us and all of us love you so much angel. “This message has been passed on by me on her social media so everybody is aware of why she will not be replying or posting.  “Thank you for everything you have done for us and what joy you have brought. “RIP my beauty.”  The mum-of-three from Wrexham, told the Daily Post she was “disgusted and sickened” when she got a phone call from a friend saying her child had seen the Snapchat post about Seren.  She said: “I had just dropped Seren at her friend’s house when I got the phone call off my friend. “I called her immediately and she told me she’d only just seen it for herself. “It made me feel sick to think that someone could do something like this and get away with it.” Victoria said her daughter, who attends Darland High School in Rossett has been having problems with bullies, which the school and police are investigating.  In a post on Facebook after the incident, furious Victoria wrote: “My daughter Seren is not dead, she has not killed herself.  “This is the kind of thing some kids will do these days to others, make up a vile Snapchat post saying that someone has killed themselves. “How insensitive, how horrendous, how hurtful to both my daughter and to me and her father. “I know that my daughter Seren would never ever do this to someone else as she knows right from wrong and has compassion for the feelings of others. “Luckily I’ve done a good job in forming her personality and I’ve given her coping skills to help her deal with the actions of lesser people she will unfortunately come across.  “Check up on what your children are faced with on social media. “Some kids won’t tell their parents like Seren does. Some kids won’t know how to deal with it and won’t be as strong as my amazing daughter Seren.” Victoria has since been monitoring Seren’s phone and has access to her passwords. She said: “It’s scary to think how few boundaries there are on social media. I’ve seen some things on there that have shocked me. “Seren uses social media responsibly so I’m not punishing her by telling her to come off it. “This is like a different type of bullying, this is very manipulative as youngsters are judged by their social media accounts and the amount of ‘friends’ and followers they have. “People don’t realise the impact something like this can have.

The Prince of Wales has recreated the look and feel of his home for the centrepiece exhibition of the summer opening of Buckingham Palace. Charles selected more than 100 pieces from private family paintings and photographs, major art from the Royal Collection and work by up-and-coming artists for the attraction, which marks his 70th birthday year. Personal touches in the exhibition include poignant family photographs, from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s recent wedding, Prince George\u0027s official christening image and a picture of Charles holding his first grandchild with the Duke of Cambridge beside him.  One of the highlights of Prince \u0026amp Patron is Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s red felt hooded cloak, a stunning artefact the heir to the throne knows well from Windsor Castle, where it was on display for a number of years. In audio commentary for exhibition visitors, Charles says about the cloak: Since, as a child, I first caught sight of this cloak in the Grand Vestibule at Windsor, I have been fascinated by the sheer magic of the colour, the dashing pattern of the lining and the enthralling story of Napoleon himself which it conjures up. It is said to have been worn by the Emperor during his Egyptian campaign and was taken from his carriage after the Battle of Waterloo 15 years later. The artwork is arranged on the walls of an octagonal room with tables filled with books by Charles, family snaps, vases and other decorative objects, while above are hung rows of paintings and other artworks, some with a tapestry as a backdrop. Vanessa Remington, senior curator of paintings at the Royal Collection Trust, said: It\u0027s a departure because it is not a standard museum display and the works aren\u0027t shown in isolation, they\u0027re shown in profusion very, very densely.  (Tables) are dressed with a range of objects and those are intended to show or give a flavour of the interiors of the Prince of Wales\u0027s own residences because this is a very personal show. The exhibition creates the impression of different areas of a drawing room from the prince\u0027s official London home Clarence House or his country retreat Highgrove in Gloucestershire. Ms Remington, curator of the exhibition, said the pieces do not have explanatory text next to them as they wanted to create a visual display rather than a museum display. In one section, painted oil sketches of William and Harry by Nicola Philipps are hung next to watercolours painted by Charles in the 1990s on the Queen\u0027s private Balmoral estate. Below are marble busts of the prince\u0027s great-great-great-grandparents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who themselves were well-known art lovers.  In the audio commentary, Charles says: I am very fond of the two preparatory oil sketches of my sons which I acquired from the artist, Nicky Philipps, in 2009. They were painted for a double portrait that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. Both are dressed in the regimental uniform of the Household Cavalry - the Blues and Royals - and are particularly good likenesses. The attraction also features work from students and artists from Charles\u0027s three arts organisations, the Royal Drawing School, the Prince\u0027s Foundation School of Traditional Arts and Turquoise Mountain, based in Kabul, Afghanistan. Some of their contributions feature Islamic-inspired artwork and other traditions from the Middle East, including a moving triple portrait of three Yezidi women painted in Iraq by Hannah Rose Thomas, after they had escaped Isis captivity.

And she\u0027s only three years old.  So far this year she\u0027s already made history by becoming the first British princess to retain her place in line of succession to the throne - despite the birth of her brother, Prince Louis .  She\u0027s also somewhat of a fashionista and often steals the show at royal events - take Louis\u0027 christening for example. And if there was any doubt as to just how fabulous the little princess is, it\u0027s about to vanish. That\u0027s because it\u0027s been revealed that Charlotte is worth more money than both of her brothers.   Reader\u0027s Digest have estimated the net worth of each member of the royal family.  Prince George is thought to be worth around \u0026pound2.7billion, with Louis, who was only born in April already predicted to boost the UK economy by \u0026pound50million before he turns one. However Charlotte takes the cake with a net worth of a whopping $5billion - that\u0027s \u0026pound3.8billion.  These calculations were based on the value the children bring to the economy, with the belief that the children have the potential to drive sales. The reason for Charlotte\u0027s incredibly high value is said to be predominantly due to her style influence, with people rushing out to buy the items she wears for their children. Often these pieces are purchased from high street brands and so are easier to get hold of and sell out in the blink of an eye - this is known as the Charlotte effect.

Happy and playful Daisy Dymyd had been playing with the two skipping ropes, which the inquest heard were her favourite toy, before the tragic accident. Her mum Charlotte had been doing some housework for around 30 minutes when she suddenly realised it was it was quiet upstairs. She went to check on Daisy and made the horrifying discovery at their home in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire. Daisy was freed by her mother who started chest compressions in an attempt to revive her.  Mrs Dymyd then dialled 999 for help and the phone operator gave her instructions as she continued CPR until a paramedic arrived to take over. Daisy was airlifted to Sheffield Children\u0027s Hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later, the hearing at Nottingham Council House heard today, Friday, July 20.  Assistant coroner for Nottinghamshire, Dr Elizabeth Didcock, concluded that it was an accidental death, reports Lincolnshire Live.  She told Daisy\u0027s father Luke: I extend my sincere condolences to you and those who knew Daisy. I am so sorry for your loss.  My findings are that there is absolutely no suspicion of any third party involvement. I wholeheartedly rule that out. There was no concern that she was anything other than a happy playful girl who enjoyed playing with toys. She liked to play horses and liked to play with animals. And she said the girl had not been left playing alone for a significant period of time. Evidence was given by detective chief inspector Peter Quinn, who was called in to investigate the incident, which took place in Daisy\u0027s home in Lincoln Road, Tuxford on February 18 this year.

At Dave Lancaster\u0027s heaviest, he had type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, joint pain, high cholesterol, the beginnings of gout and sleep apnoea – a condition which can see a person stop breathing in their sleep. He said his immobility turned him into a recluse and although he was getting bigger, he felt \u0027his world was shrinking\u0027. But the call centre manager joined Slimming World in April 2016 and began walking every day - clocking up the total of a distance greater than from San Francisco to New York and back again​. He has lost 20stone 8lbs and no longer needs any medication for his health conditions. And he doesn\u0027t have to worry about fitting in seats on public transport, breaking benches or garden furniture anymore. The 45-year-old has gone from 34stone 8lbs and wearing a size 8XL with a 66in waist to 14stone and wearing size L clothes with a 36in waist.  Dave said: “I found it difficult to walk to the end of my road, I went out so rarely except for work that I was close to becoming a recluse and I was nearing almost complete immobility. It felt as though as I was getting bigger and bigger, my world was gradually shrinking.” But after changing his lifestyle, Dave said: “I can fit in the seat of any car I like and on buses, trains and planes. I don’t have to worry about breaking benches or garden furniture anymore. I can buy clothes on the high street and put my own socks on easily I can walk miles and run up and down the stairs - the list is endless. Dave, who lives alone in his hometown of Warwick, had been overweight all his life, apart from a brief period aged 16 to 18. He tried a range of weight-loss methods, including losing 10stone on a meal replacement diet in 2007. But he says it failed to educate him about food and he regained the weight he lost soon after. It was in April 2016 when Dave decided to give Slimming World a try and joined the local group run by his former neighbour Angie Baker.  I got a huge shock when I stepped on the scales and discovered I was nearly 3stone heavier than I’d expected, he said. I couldn’t believe what I’d done to my body and that evening, I’m not ashamed to say, I cried.” The following day though Dave filled his cupboards with healthy ingredients, cooking a range of dishes including stir-fries, salads and pasta from scratch. He said: “I like the emphasis on eating food that you prepare yourself rather than ready meals and processed food. And I found that I could still eat hearty meals while losing weight.” As Dave became more confident in the kitchen, he also began to share his creations with the rest of his slimming group via social media and posted about his weight-loss journey online.  He says the support he receives from others in person and online is invaluable. Inspired by other slimmers, Dave also began to be more active. He started walking around his local park, going from one bench to the next until he could walk longer distances without needing regular breaks.

German police were waiting on the runway when the flight landed, according to one passenger. It is understood the man and another woman were taken off the flight. He was abusive and aggressive and the pilot took the decision to detour to Munich where we waited on the runway while he was removed and laid out on the tarmac, the passenger said.  The passenger said a family with young children were moved up the plane for their safety as his language and aggression were terrible and the kids started crying. She added: The hostesses were serving drinks and had moved half way down the aisle when suddenly people stared looking over their seats toward the back. This happened a few times, then an air hostess raced down the aisle. A passenger stood up and supported the air hostesses trying to calm him. The staff moved a young family who were sat nearby up to the front. Then the flight started to go down but no one had announced anything. Air staff then asked us to buckle seat belts and a lady nearby asked why we were descending and she said she couldn\u0027t say and pilot would make announcement but it was nothing to worry about. The pilot then asked everyone to return to their seats for an emergency landing. We didn\u0027t know where we were until some passengers identified it was Munich. When we landed there were lots of police on the runway.

The boys, aged just 14 when they put the plan together, had a hit-list of targets including students and teachers who had bullied or wronged them. Reporting restrictions have been lifted which means we can now name them as Thomas Wyllie, the older teen, and Alex Bolland, younger. The first page of a chilling diary recovered from the home of Wyllie read: Sorry if this is found I have committed one of the worst atrocities in British history or I killed myself. Police also discovered an arsenal of screws, flammable fluid and boards at his hideout. Today Bolland was given a 10-year prison sentence and Wyllie was jailed for 12 years.  Following their arrests in October 2017, both boys tried to claim the Yorkshire plot was nothing more than a fantasy. But sentencing the pair, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a firm plan with specific targets in mind using indiscriminate explosives. She described the pair\u0027s friendship as a noxious relationship, adding those two saw themselves as anti-heroes, with the power to choose who lives and who died. As well as professing his love of murderers in the book, Wyllie also drew a picture of what prosecutors described as the perfect school shooter. During a trial at Leeds Crown Court, prosecutors told how the pair were pupils at a school in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, in 2017.  They had hero-worshipped Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris - two teenagers who took up arms and killed 13 people in 1999 at the Columbine High School in Colorado. Jurors were told how the plans that the two put together went beyond the realms of fantasy as they downloaded bomb-making manuals, looked into purchasing weapons and warned friends of what was to come.  Wyllie, who has been described as the leader and main instigator, discussed his motivations for the attack in a diary which laid out what was later described as his twisted ideology. In a secret hideout in Catterick Garrison, he had kept a rucksack filled with screws, boards and flammable liquid, which prosecutors suggested were instruments for making an explosive device which was to be part of the killing. Prosecutors told how Wyllie had also warned his then-girlfriend that he wanted to murder her parents, so that he could run away with her and become a natural born killer.  The journal he kept also features a page of stuff we need to execute the plan, including napalm, firearms and pipe bombs. In it, he apologised for potentially committing one of the worst atrocities in British history. Bolland gave clear and unvarnished confessions of the plot to another friend, refuting suggestions that it was a joke and telling her: No one innocent will die. We promise.  When his co-conspirator lost interest in carrying out the plot, Wyllie described him to her girlfriend as his Dylan Klebold and repeatedly asked her to access her father\u0027s shotguns. In evidence, the girl\u0027s mother said: He\u0027s devious and primitive and had quite a lot of power and control over what, at the time, was our vulnerable daughter. Both were interviewed by North Yorkshire Police, who later accepted that they did not meet those standards that are expected in the way they dealt with the boys. Leeds Crown Court heard how Wyllie had started researching the Columbine massacre again within minutes of the officers leaving, despite having denied plans for the attack. In opening the case, prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said: Eighteen years after the Columbine Massacre and nearly 4,500 miles away, two young teenagers in North Yorkshire became fascinated with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. They intended a re-enactment of the Columbine High School Massacre although fortunately, in the result, they were stopped before their plans were put into action.

Laura Castillo and her US Army sergeant husband Eusebio, were arrested last year for the abuse of their adopted daughter Abigail Alvarado, now 28. Laura Castillo pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated sexual assault and was sentenced this week in a San Antonio court. She is said to have began abusing Abigail as a teenager. Talking about Laura\u0027s sentencing Abigail said: I was very emotional for the justice I\u0027m getting MySA reported. According to reports, Eusebio Castillo, previously a sergeant in the U.S. Army, was arrested in February 2017 on an aggravated sexual assault of a child charge in connection to the investigation.  He is still awaiting trial - years on from when Abigail reported the couple to the police in 2014. Eusebio is accused of abusing Abigail from nine years of age. Last year she waived her right to anonymity and opened up about the years of abuse to the San Antonio Express claimed to have suffered at the couple\u0027s hands. Abigail has said she feared coming forward about the abuse because Eusebio had repeatedly threatened to harm her children and kill himself Abigail ended up living with the Castillos, who are her aunt and uncle, in 1996. Child Protective Services in San Antonio took her, her younger brother and older sister away from their mother, Maria Rodriguez, due to her addiction to drugs and alcohol. They were eventually sent to live with Eusebio, Rodriguez\u0027s brother in Honolulu, Hawaii. Abby claimed the abuse began almost immediately after going to live with the couple.  She alleged to the American news outlet Eusebio began climbing into her bunk at night to molest her almost as soon as she arrived and when she told Laura, she ignored her. The family then moved to Texas when Abigail was a teenager. She alleges the abuse then escalated from molestation into rape with Laura Castillo beginning to help out with the sexual abuse. She also accused the couple of beating and physically abused her. When she became pregnant for the first time at 17 she claims she had to had to hide her pregnant belly at school and lie about who the father was. The abuse reportedly resulted in the birth of three children, who the Castillos raised to think Alvarado was their older sister and not their mother, according to reports. At 20 in 2008, Abigail says she was pregnant with her second child and three years later, she gave birth to her third child, a boy.

Shirley Potter got an eye infection after using the decades-old product she had in a drawer. She said she was unaware make-up carries an expiry date and it wasn\u0027t until her eye became sore she realised there was aproblem.  Now Ms Potter, from Adelaide, Australia, is expected to lose her eyesight within three years, according to Yahoo!7 .  Beauty expert Sally Nolan has warned against using out of date products - especially around the eyes.  She said: “A general rule of thumb is that product that you put around your eyes, they generally last about three to six months. Foundations and things like that, you can get about a year to 18 months out of them.” According to experts, if you are in doubt about how long you have had a product it\u0027s best to throw it away rather than take the risk. Earlier this year Theresa Lynch, 50, shared her story after finding out her sight was at risk from a common make-up habit.

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann says craig wighton needed half time telling off","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann revealed Craig Wighton needed a proverbial kick up the backside at half-time in the weekend victory at Stirling – and he won’t be letting him “rest on” his talent in the future either.After going in at the break 1-0 to the good, Wighton’s second-half performance did show more urgency, with the 20-year-old delivering a telling cross for Sofien Moussa’s second and a classy finish himself.That strike was the Scotland U/21 international’s first since a 5-1 win over Motherwell way back in February 2017 after a serious knee injury curtailed much of the last campaign.And his manager is looking forward to seeing what Wighton can bring to the side in the season ahead.Neil said: “I’m delighted for him.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens.

We’re very lucky to have Sir Tom Hunter supporting us, boosting your fund by 40%.“It’s a great way of raising un-restricted funds for local charities.“People still ask what causes they can support and the answer is simply any registered charity — and they will all get the 40%.“There’s still time to sign up but if you’re thinking of doing the 25-mile walk, I’d start training now.”The Tele is continuing backing Dundee’s Kiltwalk as a great way of raising money for good causes across Tayside — a fact that has not gone unnoticed.Paul added: “I have to thank the Evening  and its readers for their support.“It’s made such a difference for us and I can’t overstate the importance of DC Thomson, and the Evening  especially, to what we do here in Dundee.”United star Scott added: “It’s all for a good cause and it’s not every day you can say you’ve been for a walk of up to 25 miles. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for everyone that we get good weather.”As part of its partnership with the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board, the Kiltwalk team devised a road bridge ‘takeover’.Bridge staff have hung flags and banners promoting the Kiltwalk along the length of the crossing.Bridge manager Alan Hutchison said: “With the new space available to all the people of Dundee and the wider community it made sense to lend it to the Kiltwalk.”West End Liberal Democrat councillor and joint board member Fraser Macpherson said: “We’re all very supportive of the Kiltwalk and all the funds it raises for charities across Scotland.“It’s great to see the bridge staff taking such a proactive approach to getting involved and it’s fantastic that there’s such great support for it here in Dundee.”There’s still time to sign up for Dundee’s Kiltwalk — go online to thekiltwalk to find out more.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f07435f2ed-912x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people alyx set for world stage","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Monifieth street dancer is to represent Scotland on the world stage.Alyx Gray, 11, is through to the under-12 beginner/novice category at the UDO World Championships at the Hydro in Glasgow.She will also represent the country at the European Championships in the Netherlands next year.Alyx qualified after becoming Scottish champion.The former Seaview Primary pupil, who starts at Monifieth High this year, began dancing aged seven.She is coached by Laura Nisbet, who runs the Addicted 2 Dance studio in Dundee.Mum Jody said: “We are chuffed to bits.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set

Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly. That’s fantastic to see.“I gave away a pair of my boots and I think someone had them on running about the streets about 10 minutes later!”Allan Johnston’s Pars side will be looking to spoil Dundee’s return to the newly-named Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park by putting themselves into pole position in Betfred Cup Group D.And Kerr knows the Dark Blues will have to be right on their game to see off a Dunfermline side that swept past Peterhead in midweek.He added: “The game is on the TV as well which is good and the pitch is coming on really well, too. The groundsmen do a great job to give us a good pitch.“It’s always good to come out and have a game on the TV, it’s exciting, but Dunfermline are a side that will definitely try to push this year.“They’ve made some really important signings throughout their side and they’ll be a really tough test, so we’ll have to be firing on all cylinders.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/chelsea4.jpg-e1532095520810-772x564.jpg ","title":"inspirational dundee woman chelsea hoping mentor others and help to change their lives","story":"\t\t\t\t\tShe is the inspirational young woman whose harrowing open letter to her drug addict parents thrust her on to the national stage and led to her sharing a platform with the first minister.Now Young Scot of the Year Chelsea Cameron wants to use her experiences to mentor others and offer them the chance to do life-changing voluntary work.Chelsea, 20, a former head girl at Menzieshill High School, made headlines in January last year after she wrote to mum Tammy and dad Alexander about her upbringing in Menzieshill.Chelsea with First Minister Nicola SturgeonShe described her parents’ behaviour and the devastating impact drug addiction could have on families.Her life has changed dramatically since then and now she wants other young people to be given experiences and skills to build themselves a future.Chelsea, who works as a PA, said: “I’m looking to informally mentor and give a voluntary opportunity to a young person between the ages of 16-20.“If it turns out that I get a huge response I will need to sit down and work out how to make the selection.“It may be possible to take on more than one young person initially – maybe a boy and a girl.“Over the past year I’ve had so many opportunities to attend great events and meet so many incredible people that I used to think were so far out of my reach.“As Young Scot of the Year, I’m committed to helping another young person to have opportunities to broaden their horizons and realise the world is their oyster.“I attend many events ranging from speaking to young people, policy makers, politicians and everything in between – there was even royalty once.”Chelsea added: “I have given this a lot of thought and would love to hear from people who think they would like to take up this opportunity.“I feel a responsibility to do something to help someone else in the way I have been helped.“Along the way, I’d hope this young person develops self- confidence, good communication, presentation and public speaking skills, time management and how to prioritise.“This is a fantastic chance to develop some skills and build networking opportunities that can be advantageous for future employment.“All of this is combined with lots of fun and plenty of chocolate cake.

18-20 Castle Street, which served up the famous Wallace peh, was a household name in the city from the turn of the 20th Century until it closed down in the late 1970s.Owned by David Wallace, it was once part of a string of pie shops run by the family, also featuring a restaurant named Wallace’s Tea Rooms.Dundee-based Castle Development has now been granted planning permission to convert the C-listed bakehouse at the back of the former shop and tearooms into a two-bedroom home.The development will add to the ongoing conversion of the adjacent St Paul’s Church, which is being transformed from a pub into residential accommodation.The business originally opened in 1892 in the Vault under the Caird Hall, an area now being converted into trendy restaurants such as the recently-opened Brassica.In the early 1920s Mr Wallace moved to the building on Castle Street, when the Vault was due for demolition, as the building was big enough to open the tearoom as well as the two-floor bakehouse.During the Second World War it is reported the queues for pies and bridies used to stretch down to the bottom of the street as they were able to supplement the meat ration. Now hidden from street view, the bakehouse has not been used since it closed 41 years ago, in 1977.A pend between two shops allows access from the street, which then opens up into a large courtyard and the entrance to the bakery.A design statement submitted by RDA Architects, on behalf of Castle Development, says the history of the building will be incorporated.It states: “The proposals seek to highlight the historic elements on the replacement elevation highlighting the area from which the dilapidation began, visibly documenting the history of the site and ensuring the preservation of the remaining structure.“The materials have been carefully considered against the context of the former bakery, its perceived history and gradual dilapidation and eventual demolition of its western elevation.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"social enterprise conference to be held in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn event aimed at promoting social enterprise in Tayside and Fife is being planned.The inaugural Tayside and Fife Social Enterprise Conference will be held in Dundee this autumn.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Having teamed up with our partners Dundee Social Enterprise Network, Perth and Kinross Association of Voluntary Service and Perth and Kinross, Angus and Fife councils, we are looking to attract about 150 delegates from third, public and private sector organisations from across the regions with an exciting conference programme.“The conference focus will be inclusive growth, welcoming influential keynote speakers such as Will Tyler-Greig, head of social enterprise, social innovation and investment at the Scottish Government, and Aiden Pia, executive director at Senscot, with more speakers to be announced in the coming weeks.“There will be the opportunities for social enterprises to enter our awards.“The categories are best new start-up – under two years, best innovative idea, best social impact, best growth business and young social entrepreneur.”Nominations for the awards will open in August, with the winners being announced at the conference.Anyone wanting more information about the conference and sponsorship opportunities should email elaine.cox@dundeecity.gov.uk or admin@dundeesen.org.The conference will be held in the city’s Apex Hotel.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We are going for a victory.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8053922.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"g1-bosses-admit-to-breaching-workers-rights","story":"                          SCOTLAND\u0026rsquoS largest hospitality group this week admitted breaching employees rights after it refused staff at a Glasgow cafe access to trade union representation.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"bomb-squad-descend-on-south-side-street-after-suspicious-package-is-discovered","story":"                          Specialist officers swarmed a house in Drumoyne after a suspicious package was found."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8093156.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"one-down-three-to-go-what-next-in-celtics-bid-to-reach-the-champions-league","story":"                          BANANA skin dodged, Celtic continue in their quest to return to the group stage of the Champions League next week after emphatically seeing off the challenge of Alashkert."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8095010.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"celtic-defender-jozo-simunovic-wont-learn-full-european-fate-until-after-rosenborg-first-leg-game","story":"                          Celtic defender Jozo Simunovic will have to wait until next Friday before discovering the full extent of his UEFA punishment."},{"url":null,"title":"summer-garden-opens-in-buchanan-street","story":"                          IT\u0027S a summer garden in the heart of the city."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8095160.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"quarrybrae-primary-placing-request-snubbed-by-glasgow-city-council-leaving-mum-with-four-kids-at-three-schools","story":"                          A MUM has hit out at Glasgow City Council after a placing request refusal leaves her managing four children at three different schools."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7624296.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"toryglen-flats-saga-from-thistle-housing-and-e-on-continues-with-residents-claiming-turmoil","story":"                          RESIDENTS at the chaos-hit Toryglen renovation works claim the situation is still in \u0026lsquoturmoil\u0026rsquo."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8030619.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cadburys-to-reduce-chocolate-bar-sugar-content-by-30-per-cent","story":"                          A new version of the Cadbury Dairy Milk bar containing 30% less sugar is to go on sale from next year as part of industry efforts to respond to the obesity crisis."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7067570.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"further-blow-for-sauchiehall-street-traders-as-weekend-resurfacing-work-to-disrupt-traffic","story":"                          Businesses continuing to operate on Sauchiehall Street following two disastrous fires have been dealt another blow."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/6733940.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"from-kylie-to-blur-remember-when-t-in-the-park-was-held-at-strathclyde","story":"                          WHEN former festival T in the Park first launched in the 90s -

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else.

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:35

baffling","story":"\u0026nbsp\"BAFFLED\" councillors have hit out at plans to shut a key access to a popular Inverness beauty spot for up to six weeks at the height of the tourist season.The suspension bridge linking Bught Road with Whin Island will close this Monday for \"essential repairs\" as part of wider refurbishment of footpaths within the Ness Islands.The move will temporarily cut off access to the beauty spot from the west side of the River Ness at a time when visitor numbers are at their highest.And that decision has sparked questions from puzzled councillors, who have asked why work is beginning now \u0026ndash 13 months after the cash for it was signed off and three months after work elsewhere on the latest phase got underway.They have also criticised the short one week notice period given to the public.Inverness West councillor Alex Graham, said: \"It was very disappointing that [the public] were given such short notice of the work, particularly because it is used as the main access to the Ness Islands from the Bught side [of the river] and of course it\u0027 also part of the Great Glen Way route as well so it\u0027 important to tourists as well as locals.\"I accept that the work is necessary and has to be done and I\u0026rsquove been in touch with the council to see if work can be done as quickly as possible and in less than six weeks.\"But I\u0026rsquom a bit baffled as to why it has taken so long [to start], as there was approval in June 2017 for an extra \u0026pound73k for work on the bridges.\"Why has it taken a year between then and the work?\"Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister also raised concerns, and highlighted the impact the closure could have on people heading to and from local events, such as the open air Little Mix concert on Sunday, July 29.She added that if the work needed settled weather and low river levels, it could have been carried out months before now thanks to the exceptionally dry spring and summer the Highlands has experienced.\"I can\u0026rsquot understand it,\" she said. \"Why not start in April or early May \u0026ndash they could have had it done.\"I\u0026rsquom not happy with the timing, especially when we\u0026rsquove had such good weather. They could\u0026rsquove saved lots of hassle if they\u0026rsquod just got on with it.\"Someone probably needs to get their knuckles rapped. It\u0027 such bad timing. If it was that dangerous and bad why not carry out the work before. And if it\u0027 not dangerous why not leave it [to a quieter time]?\"\"They could easily do it in September.\"Highland Council insisted the timing was due to the need for a settled weather window, and that the Monday start date was designed to avoid this weekend\u0027 Inverness Highland Games.A spokeswoman said: \"The council apologises for any inconvenience that this will cause and is mindful of the fact that the closure is taking place throughout the summer, however the works are necessary for the essential maintenance of the bridge and the closure is for public safety.\"The timing of the refurbishment in the summer season is necessary as it provides the best weather conditions to get the work done safely with lower river levels.\"Meanwhile, the council has urged the public to stop attaching so-called \u0026lsquolove locks\u0026rsquo to bridges, and plans to remove any it finds during the repair work. It also called on people not to place stickers on lamps, benches or bridges.\"The padlocks cause rust and both stickers and padlocks damage paintwork,\" they said. \"All existing padlocks and stickers will be removed as part of the refurbishment works and the council\u0027 plea is to leave no trace.\"Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"cosgrove heads first aberdeen goal in 1 1 friendly draw with west brom","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStriker Sam Cosgrove headed his first Aberdeen goal as the Reds drew 1-1 with English Championship West Bromwich Albion at Pittodrie.The friendly was the Dons\u0026#8217 last game before they get their Europa League second qualifying round tie under way at Pittodrie on Thursday night.It looked to be a useful encounter for Derek McInnes and his side, providing an idea of standard they will come up against when the Clarets come to town.Cosgrove\u0026#8217s 37th minute goal, which he nodded past Jonathan Bond from a Gary Mackay-Steven cross, was cancelled out five minutes later by Jake Livermore\u0026#8217s tap in.Dons boss Derek McInnes gave Mikey Devlin, back from a groin strain, a start alongside Scott McKenna, while skipper Graeme Shinnie filled in for Andy Considine at left-back, with Shay Logan on the right as usual.New signing Dom Ball went straight into holding midfield behind Lewis Ferguson and Chris Forrester.Sam Cosgrove was up front, with Scott Wright and Gary Mackay-Steven on the flanks.Darren Moore’s team’s previous outing was a 3-1 win over Swindon, which saw Scotland international and free agent James Morrison play after 10 months out injured.Morrison, 32, is fighting for a new deal at the Hawthorns, but was left on the bench at Pittodrie for West Brom, relegated from the Premier League last term.Household names like Kieran Gibbs, Livermore, Chris Brunt and Jay Rodriguez did start.Aberdeen looked sharp and alert though, especially in central midfield, where Ball, Forrester and Ferguson already look in tune with each other.They were switching positions and closing down well and, on 25 minutes, the increasingly direct Ferguson robbed Sam Field in the Reds’ half and, seeing Jonathan Bond in no man’s land, his attempt to lob the keeper flew just over the bar.Cosgrove was wrongly flagged on 35 minutes when put in behind the defence and should have had his first goal for Aberdeen – and only his second in senior football.He got the goal 37 minutes though. Gary Mackay-Steven flying down the left wing before delivering a perfect cross, which Englishman COSGROVE nodded into right bottom corner past  Bond.Frustratingly for the Dons, LIVERMORE equalised five minutes later, slotting home after Edwards ‘ low point-blank shot from Rodriguez’s centre was saved well by Joe Lewis to his left.West Brom made defensive changes at half-time and before they could settle Cosgrove was in their faces, putting them under pressure and looking like he might just develop into the now-gone Adam Rooney of a few seasons ago, but with more physical threat.By 66 minutes, Moore had made seven changes, while Stevie May had replaced Cosgrove – Aberdeen’s best player, and trialist Krystian Nowak had come on for Devlin.This saw both sides become noticeably less cohesive and more reliant on long vertical passes.There were a few more changes for Aberdeen, and Graeme Shinnie almost nicked it, his close-range header being palmed away by appropriately named West Brom sub keeper Alex Palmer.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b502c170788f-940x537.jpg ","title":"26 bypass signs need altered or replaced after aberdeen exhibition centre renamed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than two dozen signs on the new bypass will need to be altered or replaced as a result of the new Aberdeen exhibition centre being renamed.There are 26 signs on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route directing traffic to the new complex on the A96 – which last week announced it would be renamed the Event Complex Aberdeen (TECA).That means all of the signs saying “AECC” will need to be altered or even replaced.It is understood the cost of making the changes will fall to the centre’s owner SMG Europe.However, it has not yet been decided if that will involve altering or removing the incorrect signs.Any changes can be requested by the developer – in this case SMG – and Transport Scotland, along with the local authority, will make the alterations.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The strategic signing policy was agreed with the local authority and any changes to the signage has to be agreed with them.”An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said changes “would have to be agreed with Transport Scotland” and referred inquiries to TECA’s operator SMG Europe.A spokeswoman for SMG Europe, which operates the venue, would only say: “Discussions are under way into this matter.”SNP group leader councillor Stephen Flynn said it would be “beyond embarrassing” if the signage was wrong.He said: “I agree with those folk who have said that TECA is a fairly uninspiring name change and would prefer not to see it on any sign.“However, if they are to press ahead with the new title then it would be beyond embarrassing not to have signage to match.“Ultimately, it’s really poor that there doesn’t appear to have been much, if any, communication between partners on such a simple issue and any changes shouldn’t be borne by the public purse.”Liberal Democrat councillor Ian Yuill added: “It is important that the signage is clear.“Given that SMG Europe decided on a different name for the AECC and that TECA will be its name going forward, it makes sense that the signs should use that name.“I do believe that SMG Europe should be fronting any costs to make those changes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/Cannonbawz-at-Ballindalloch-Castle.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"electrifying initiative links in with

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

John\u0026#8217s 72 was the best gross score on the day with Peter Mclean Jnr moving into third place when he recovered from a horror start to post a 76.The handicap trophy was another tight affair with Jimmy MacNab showing the youngsters how it is done with a superb net 64 taking a one shot lead over David Ronald and a two-shot lead over James Smyth.The John Reid Quaich which is played as part of the championship was won by Duncan Johnstone on 134, edging out Iain Macalister by one shot.Despite the weather conditions, the members gathered in good spirits for the final round of the championship, a day that everyone looks forward to and with all competitions very close an interesting days play lay ahead.In the leading group, play was a bit nervy with neither player at their best on the front nine with Iain reducing the deficit to one shot with eight holes left to play. John got one back at the 11th and then another two at the 12th before a birdie at the 14th pretty much saw him home and dry. In the end John\u0026#8217s inward nine of 35 and a final round of 74 saw him win by six shots.In the nett trophy 83-year-old Jimmy MacNab and David Ronald tied on 266 after scores of 69 and 68 respectively, David enjoying three birdies in a row at six, seven and eight.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a look at the advertiser of yesteryear","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 11:54 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowWith the success of the Islay Mòd still fresh in our minds, it is clear that taking part in regional and the national Mòd is a long-standing tradition for Mid Argyll youngsters.For more than 20 years Mid Argyll students have done us proud at the Gaelic singing competitions, as seen here in our edition from 1998, when singers from all over Argyll made their way to the Royal National Mòd on the Isle of Skye.The Lochgilphead Primary Gaelic Choir came fourth in their competition, with the Lochfyneside Junior Gaelic Choir gaining top music mark in their unison singing competition.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Catherine also works in the entertainment industry as a photobooth attendant for Foxy Photo booths. The couple are from Irvine and have two kids together, David, 9, and Darcy, 2. The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock.

Catherine said: “We were lucky enough that both sets of grandparents looked after the kids and we got a full seven nights in the Luxury Moon Palace Resort in Cancun, Mexico. “We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked off the plane - butler service, 24hr room service, chauffeur driven everywhere. “But, it rained 22 hours a day for almost six days out of seven so we were stuck inside felling like we were at Irvine beach not the Caribbean Coast! Hugh McFedries Photography and Magic Memories Videography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. Flowers were arranged by Myra Craigen @ Balloons and Blooms and their cake created by Not Just Cake, Bellshill.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"vandal hunt after cars vandalised","story":"NewsVandal hunt after cars are vandalisedNeighbours are furious about old cars the owner refuses to move\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston12:29, 18 JUL 2018Updated12:33, 18 JUL 2018NewsFour motors are always parked at Raithhill (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIT’S a highly curious tale that’s causing unrest in an Alloway neighbourhood. A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.

Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.

Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children.

Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

But according to reports the party may be taking place in the Caribbean, as William and Kate are rumoured to have taken their children on a summer break to the exclusive island of Mustique.  George has made a number of eventful public appearances over the past 12 months, from starting school to a cheeky moment on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony, as the royal family celebrated the Queen\u0026rsquos official birthday.  But he can sometimes appear a little shy and reluctant in front of the cameras \u0026ndash understandable for a young boy who is slowly getting to grips with life in the limelight.  Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge was born at the private maternity unit of St Mary\u0026rsquos Hospital, Paddington, the Lindo Wing, at 4.24pm on July 22, 2013, weighing 8lbs 6oz.  He made his public debut in front of the world\u0026rsquos media on the hospital steps one day later, wrapped in a white merino wool shawl, cradled in his proud parents\u0026rsquo arms.  A great-grandchild to the Queen, he will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England if, as expected, his reign follows those of the Prince of Wales, then William.  A few months after his last birthday George started his first day at school with his father, but without his mother, Kate. She was experiencing severe morning sickness as she was pregnant with Prince Louis.  The duke managed his parenting duties alone and said later: \u0026ldquoIt went well. There was one other parent who had more of an issue with their children \u0026ndash so I was quite pleased I wasn\u0026rsquot the one.  The youngster has just completed his first year at school, attending Thomas\u0026rsquos Battersea in south London.  He even played a sheep in his school\u0026rsquos Christmas nativity play, and loves helicopters, flying and is obsessed with all things police-related.  When baby brother Louis was born he joined younger sister Princess Charlotte outside the Lindo Wing in April as they visited their new brother with their father.  In June George and his family joined the Queen and other royals on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony as the monarch\u0026rsquos official birthday celebrations drew to a close with the traditional fly-past.  But the young prince was seen playing up with seven-year-old Savannah, the daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips, who jokingly put her hand over his mouth.  George was last seen at the christening of his baby brother Louis at the Chapel Royal at St James\u0026rsquos Palace on July 9, and in official photos marking the royal baptism."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7785087.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"humza-yousafs-thumbs-up-to-hilarious-memes-poking-fun-at-his-official-government-pictures","story":"  The internet has delighted in poking fun at the new Justice Secretary\u0026rsquos official \u0026ldquoserious and \u0026ldquosmiling Scottish Government by satirising them to illustrate good and bad news.

The new Dairy Milk bar will sit alongside the original on shelves and offer consumers greater choice, the company said.  Glenn Caton, Mondelez International president for Northern Europe, said the science behind the reformulation was a \u0026ldquotrade secret but said some of the sugar had been replaced with fibre to maintain the original bar\u0026rsquos structure and texture.  He described the taste of the new bar as \u0026ldquoincredibly similar to the original, saying: \u0026ldquoIt tastes very, very close to the original but a little less sweet. It\u0026rsquos been tested extensively on consumers and they love it.  Mondelez said a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers worked for almost two years at its Reading and Bournville units to cut sugar without adding any artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives.  The calorie content remains similar between the two bars, but the sugar content has dropped from 56g per 100g in the original bar to 39g per 100g in the new version.  Mondelez said it would look to apply the approach to other Cadbury Dairy Milk products if it proves successful with consumers.  It also unveiled plans for the next two years to release its Cadbury Boost+ Protein bar with 32% less sugar, 30% lower sugar versions of its Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums and Jelly Babies products and a line of its BelVita breakfast biscuits with 40% less sugar.  Longer term plans include a reformulation of Cadbury Brunch bars to cut sugar by around 20% and a lower sugar version of Oreo biscuits.  Mr Caton said the company recognised that consumers wanted to manage their sugar intake.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur brands have been around for hundreds of years. They are a part of British culture and heritage and play a special role in people\u0026rsquos lives as treats to be enjoyed during a moment of indulgence.  \u0026ldquoTaking sugar out of our products isn\u0026rsquot easy and will take time. Ultimately they are treats and people expect them to taste great, but we\u0026rsquore working hard to find innovative solutions that provide more choice without compromising on their world-renowned taste and quality.

Football experts have already \u0026ldquored flagged moves for two internationalists - France\u0026rsquos Florent Sinama Pongolle and Russia\u0026rsquos Konstantin Rausch - which involved payments to opaquely owned firms registered in Edinburgh and London respectively.  British shell firms - marketed off-the-peg across the former Soviet Union and beyond as vehicles for secrecy and tax avoidance - have been embroiled in numerous major fraud, corruption and money-laundering scandals in recent years.  The UK Government this weekend ends a consultation on how to reform the most notoriously abused British corporate entity, the Scottish limited partnership or SLP.  Russian investigative journalists have revealed secret payments to an SLP when Mr Pongolle, a former Liverpool striker, was transferred from Sporting Lisbon to FK Rostov in 2012.  More recently Moscow\u0026rsquos Dinamo has dismissed its general director after discovering payments made to an English limited liability partnership or LLP when it signed Mr Rausch, a wing back, from Germany\u0026rsquos Koeln earlier this year.    Konstantin Rausch  SNP MP and Motherwell fan Alison Thewliss has been leading attempts to in the House of Commons to convince the Conservatives to take a tougher line on SLPs and UK corporate governance.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt seems there are no limits to the areas where dirty money, laundered through Scottish Limited Partnerships, will go.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos particularly frustrating to see this money seeping into football and the purchase of players - we all want to see our team win, but this shouldn\u0026rsquot come at any cost.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on SLPs closes next week - they must use this opportunity to clamp down on dubious shell firms and protect the reputation of the beautiful game.    Alison Thewliss  Former Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish - a former professional footballer for Leeds United - has long been concerned about what he called \u0026ldquobackroom financial dealings in his sport.  Mr McLeish said: \u0026ldquoTo retain the trust and respect of supporters we must have probity and scrutiny. This extends to so-called shell companies  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government must clamp down on these structures. Football is global and so is finance. We have to be aware of what is happening in our sport: we need a clean game based on clean money.    Henry McLeish  Dynamo\u0026rsquos chairman Vladimir Strzhalkovsky discovered a payment of 1.25m euros to an LLP called Golden Toys, according to recent news media reports in both Germany and Russia. Mr Strzhalkovsky, a former KGB officer and tycoon close to Putin whose son bought a stately home in Scotland this year, is understood to have reported the matter to the authorities. There is no suggestion that Mr Rausch, who missed the World Cup through injury, was involved.  Moscow newspaper Novaya Gazeta uncovered a payment of 650,000 euros from Rostov to an SLP called Trademarket Networks as part of Mr Pongolle\u0026rsquos transfer. The paper cites bank records showing the money was passed on to a now closed English LLP called Drensler. From there, it alleges, cash ended up in the account of a club official.  Trademarket Networks, now dissolved was based at 78 Montgomery Street, Edinburgh, which hosts 3000 or so other \u0026ldquo. shells. The SLP was one of those used as part of the $1 billion robbery of three Moldovan banks. Densler also featured in the same case.

The organisers of the ECI cited Brexit as the reason for submitting the petition and the future possible loss of EU citizenship and rights by UK nationals.  \u0026ldquoThe main objective of the proposed initiative is to guarantee that European citizenship and its associated rights cannot be lost once they have been attained, the Commission said.  \u0026ldquoThe organisers cite in particular the context of Brexit and the future loss of EU citizenship and rights to UK citizens, it added.  A Commission spokesperson said that the decision to register the initiative concerns only the legal admissibility of the proposal and that it had yet not analysed the substance of the petition.    Petitioners will need to get a total of at least one million signatures\u0026nbspthat includes residents in at least seven EU nations.  The Commission can then decide either to back the request or not, and in both instances would be required to explain its reasoning.  The organisers say in the text of the petition that it aims to \"uphold the right of Union citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of member states under objective conditions of freedom and dignity\u0026nbspand to safeguard citizens of the Union from use as bargaining chips in negotiations under Article 50...\"  It requests the Commission \"submit a proposal to retain the rights of EU citizenship for all those who have already exercised their freedom of movement prior to the departure of a members state\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspleaving the Union, and for those nationals of a departing state who wish to retain their status as citizens of the union.\"  The organisers of the move which includes seven nationals from\u0026nbspBritain, France, Italy, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Greece and Belgium say a separate passport\u0026nbsp\"might be issued as a consequence of this\" if the suggestion is approved.  The organisers say: \"Retaining European Citizenship aims to appeal to all citizens of the European Union. Citizenship - and the rights and responsibilities that go with it - should not so easily be stripped away from European citizens.    \"We are concerned with those who wish to retain their citizenship, with EU nationals in the UK who face an uncertain future as a result of Brexit, with UK nationals residing in EU countries and with all those who want to defend their citizenship.\"  EU citizenship guarantees freedom of movement in the EU and other rights  Brits were expected to lose their EU citizenship after Brexit is in effect, either in March 2019 or at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  EU citizenship would not replace British nationality but would\u0026nbspbe additional to national citizenship.  It would grant specific rights such as the right to travel and live anywhere in the EU and the right to vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections where they are living.  It would also\u0026nbspallows EU citizens to get diplomatic protection and consular help from any EU country wherever they are in the world, even if their own country does not have a local embassy.  The petition asks that people who wish to retain their EU citizenship after Brexit be allowed to do so.  The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - two years after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the exit process by invoking Article 50.  And Westminster\u0026nbsphas been adamant that free movement would end at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  In a parliamentary answer on the citizenship question, Lord Ahmad of the Foreign Office said \"when the UK ceases to be a member of the European Union, British nationals will no longer hold EU citizenship, unless they hold dual nationality with another EU member state\".  Lord Callanan of the Department for Exiting the European Union said retaining EU citizenship for Britons post-Brexit had not been ruled out, but it \"would involve changing treaties\". \"The other side [EU negotiators] has shown no interest whatever in doing it,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-set-to-be-handed-powers-to-banish-lap-dancing-clubs","story":"  A new licensing regime would hand local authorities greater control over the number of sexual entertainment venues operating in their boundaries.

Violence Against Women Partnerships (VAWP) insisted the Scottish Government should work with councils to outlaw lap-dancing clubs.  But venue operators said it was \u0026ldquounfair and untrue to imply that lap-dancing is a form of violence against women.  Brightcrew, operators of Platinum Lace in Glasgow, argued its performers \u0026ldquoare all strong, independent, talented women who choose to work in sexual entertainment.  It added: \u0026ldquoIt is a well-remunerated occupation. It is a form of performance. It provides great flexibility in terms of hours and days of work, meaning that performers can work when they like, ensuring that they can find a balance between their work and other demands on their time, be it family, other work or studies.  The Scottish Government said it would consider the consultation responses before bringing in new rules.  Provisions to create a new licensing regime were voted through Holyrood in 2015 as part of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act.  The legislation allows councils to decide whether they want to licence sexual entertainment venues and set the number able to operate in their area.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoLicensing of sexual entertainment venues does not seek to ban lap dancing or strip clubs but to allow local licensing authorities to decide what is right for their area.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government accepts the freedom of adults to engage in legal activities and employment.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it will continue to promote, through all relevant means, gender equality and actions that tackle out-dated attitudes that denigrate or objectify particular groups or individuals."},{"url":null,"title":"bifab-workers-accuse-bosses-of-ditching-full-time-staff-in-favour-of-agencies","story":"  In a statement addressed to Scottish ministers, they said such a move would \u0026ldquoseriously damage any hope of winning new contracts.  It comes after BiFab ran into severe financial problems late last year, forcing the Scottish Government to step in and broker a deal with new Canadian owners DF Barnes.  Last week, unions warned the yards \u0026ndash located in Fife and Lewis \u0026ndash were now effectively closed with almost no workers left on the sites.  In their statement, the workforce said the new owners had not engaged with union leaders, and were instead seeking to replace experienced staff with agency employees.  The BiFab yards previously had a core workforce of 400 and a further 1,000 contractors.  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie insisted the claims raised \u0026ldquoserious questions about the SNP Government\u0027s recent handling of the crisis.  She said: \"Trade unions and the workforce deserve praise for their courageous fight to protect jobs.  \"Laying off the highly-skilled core workforce would devastate families and communities \u0026ndash and lead to a loss of skills and experience that would be impossible to replace.  \"The SNP government simply cannot be in a position where it has allowed itself to be a facilitator for making skilled workers redundant and replaced with insecure agency work.  \"That is an outrage and SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay must immediately address these reports and take swift action to ensure these skills are not lost for good.\"  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the SNP Government had been \u0026ldquoeasily duped by this company and has now cleared the way for the casualisation of the workforce.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard very little from the SNP since they press released saving the yard back in April. BiFab workers are right to feel betrayed.  But a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe are in regular contact with BiFab \u0026ndash including a meeting between ministers and senior representatives that took place this week.  \u0026ldquoWe have made a long term investment in the company, however we do not participate in operational management decisions.  \u0026ldquoIt was clear at the point new ownership was secured that conditions would remain challenging for the yards and new contracts would have to be won to secure future work.  \u0026ldquoThe workforce played a major role in securing new investment for the yards and the prospect of securing future contracts which DF Barnes is working toward.  \u0026ldquoWe have confidence that everything possible is being done to secure new contracts and restore employment to previous levels."},{"url":null,"title":"sixty-pianos-are-the-key-to-a-playable-fringe-venue","story":"  The Pianodrome, when constructed, will be placed on the Pyrus Lawn at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh for a series of shows from August 3 to 26 during the Fringe.

Speaking at the city\u0026rsquos Waterfront Hall, she is due to say that any such deal would go against the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland 20 years ago after decades of conflict.  Mrs May will say that following the publication of the Government\u0026rsquos white paper agreed at Chequers, it is \u0026ldquonow for the EU to respond.  She will add: \u0026ldquoNot simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind.  \u0026ldquoAnd, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.  The EU\u0026rsquos other 27 states will have a chance to examine and respond to the white paper when its General Council of ministers meets in Brussels on Friday morning.  They will also receive an update on negotiations from the European Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.  The Irish border issue is one of the most disputed parts of the Brexit negotiations.  In the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain, something Mrs May has repeatedly opposed.  The UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole.          I enjoyed meeting @MichelBarnier , discussing the progress we have made, and the outstanding issues to resolve across the Withdrawal Agreement and the Future Framework. I\u0026rsquom looking forward to stepping up the pace and energy in our negotiations. https://t.co/7v0D91sS8I          \u0026mdash Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) July 19, 2018  Her speech comes the day after new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab headed to Brussels for the first time to take part in talks with Mr Barnier.  Mr Barnier told reporters on Thursday that it was \u0026ldquoa matter of urgency to agree a legally operative backstop, saying: \u0026ldquoWe need an all-weather insurance policy.  Mr Raab said that he was looking forward \u0026ldquowith renewed energy, vigour and vim to seeing the detail of the White Paper hammered out after a gruelling Cabinet conclave at Chequers.  Brexiteer Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom put some pressure on Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan, saying the EU must be told the Chequers blueprint, which has divided the Conservative party, is the \u0026ldquofinal offer rather than an opening gambit.  However she also admitted quitting without an agreement would not be an \u0026ldquooptimal solution.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, meanwhile, insisted the deal is \u0026ldquoabsolutely alive despite the Government being forced to make concessions to Brexiteers.  Mrs May will again refuse to countenance any backstop that creates a divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoThe economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal \u0026lsquothird country\u0026rsquo customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept.  \u0026ldquoAnd as they made clear this week, it is not something the House of Commons will accept either.  As the EU warns member states to increase preparations for no deal, the Prime Minister is also due to insist that an agreement can be reached with Brussels \u0026ldquothat works in our mutual interest.  She will say the deal will put the UK on the way to \u0026ldquoa prosperous future, protecting jobs and boosting prosperity at the same time as honouring the 2016 referendum result, adding: \u0026ldquoI am passionate about that brighter future and the possibilities that are within our grasp.  Amid the ongoing power-sharing impasse at Stormont, Mrs May is meeting the five main political parties on her two day visit to Northern Ireland, which included her first visit to the Irish border since the Brexit referendum.  She held talks with her Westminster confidence and supply partners, the DUP, on Thursday evening, an engagement that included a private dinner with leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds in Co Fermanagh.  Mrs May also held talks with an SDLP delegation.  On Friday morning she will meet Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists and Alliance Party.  Ahead of the meeting on the outskirts of Belfast, Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald heavily criticised Mrs May\u0026rsquos handling of the Brexit process.  \u0026ldquoThe British government\u0026rsquos Brexit chaos has been marked by prevarication and stalling, ever changing positions and broken agreements, she said.  \u0026ldquoThis situation is intolerable and unacceptable.

The UK would be free to set its own controls on immigration by EU nationals.  \u0026ndash Delays to cross-Channel freight due to new customs, sanitary and phytosanitary checks could hit supplies of food and other goods. Britain could opt to waive checks to help keep traffic moving, but this may not be matched by the EU.  \u0026ndash Without a trade deal for goods, the UK would have to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, which require tariffs on products ranging from\u0026nbsp4% on liquefied natural gas to 9.8% on cars and 32% on wine. Britain would trade with the EU under the WTO\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquomost favoured nation status, preventing either side from imposing punitive tariffs, but the move away from frictionless zero-tariff trade is certain to drive up prices in the shops.  \u0026ndash Britain would be free to sign new free trade deals with countries around the world, and negotiations would get under way in earnest with states like the US and Australia. But these talks could last years, and in the meantime, the UK would lose access to free trade deals the EU has struck with dozens of countries, including Japan, Canada and South Korea.  \u0026ndash Opponents of a no-deal Brexit warn that major manufacturers in sectors like automotive, aerospace and pharmaceuticals would shift operations from the UK into the remaining 27 EU states in order to avoid delays and disruption to products and components crossing the border.  \u0026ndash Financial institutions in the City of London and other centres around the UK would lose their \u0026ldquopassporting rights to operate in EU countries, and could activate contingency plans to move some or all of their operations overseas.  \u0026ndash The UK\u0026rsquos annual contributions of around \u0026pound13 billion to EU budgets would cease, providing an instant windfall to the Government. But there would be pressure on ministers to make up the loss of Common Agricultural Policy subsidies totalling \u0026pound3 billion to farmers, as well as EU support for science and disadvantaged regions.  \u0026ndash New arrangements would have to be made to certify UK aviation for safety in order to ensure that planes are not grounded.  \u0026ndash Britain\u0026rsquos agreement to pay a \u0026ldquodivorce bill of up to \u0026pound39 billion would be void, and a House of Lords report has suggested that the money would no longer be payable. But some legal experts believe the EU could take the UK to the International Court of Justice to recoup the cash, which represents payments to which Britain committed itself while a member.  \u0026ndash Britain would no longer be bound by the rulings of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. But it would continue to be subject to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which is not an EU body.  \u0026ndash Professionals may find that qualifications obtained in the UK are no longer recognised in EU states, and may have to obtain new authorisations in order to continue to practise.  \u0026ndash Individuals and businesses could lose the right to apply for EU grants or tender for work with EU institutions.  \u0026ndash The status of the 300-mile Northern Irish border with the Republic would be unresolved.

And he indicated the EU was ready to amend its \"backstop\" proposals for the Irish border, which have become the biggest stumbling block in talks.  But the chief negotiator also made clear there were elements of the plan agreed by the Cabinet earlier this month, which the European Commission did not understand, and said further discussions would be needed over the coming weeks to establish how much \"common ground\" exists between London and Brussels.  Mrs May\u0027s proposal for a \"facilitated customs arrangement\" opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses, he claimed.  Mr Barnier was speaking shortly after the PM issued a challenge to Brussels to \"evolve\" its negotiating position in response to the publication of her Brexit blueprint.  He said the EU had always been \"creative and flexible\" in its approach to negotiations.  But he insisted that future talks would be based on the guidelines issued by the European Council in March - which included the controversial proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union - and not on Mrs May\u0027s document.  \"There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop,\" declared Mr Barnier.  \"It\u0027s not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop - the one that the Commission proposed on behalf of the Union.  \"Technically we feel that it\u0027s workable, we can improve it further, we can work on it. We are doing that work.  \"But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later.\"  In her first major Brexit speech since the wave of ministerial resignations which followed her Chequers deal, Mrs May described the White Paper proposals as \"a significant development of our position...a coherent package\".  And she said: \"It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.  \"And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.\"  Speaking in Belfast, the PM also took aim at critics from the hard Brexit wing of the Conservative Party, accusing them of being ready to \"betray\" the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic.  She took on the argument of prominent Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who say the UK should simply declare it will impose no checks on its side of the Irish border and leave it to Brussels to decide whether to require the Republic to erect barriers on the other.  \"The protection of the peace process and upholding our binding commitments in the Belfast Agreement are grave responsibilities,\" she said.  \"Not to seek a solution would be to resume our career as an independent sovereign trading nation by betraying commitments to a part of our nation and to our nearest neighbour.\"  And she took a swipe at former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u0027s claim - repeated in his resignation speech to the Commons on Wednesday - that technological solutions could be used to avoid the need for infrastructure at the border.  \"No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border,\" she said.  Mrs May restated her implacable opposition to the EU backstop, which she said would involve the creation of a customs border within the UK, which was \"something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept\".  Equally, she said that a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was \"almost inconceivable\".  Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, the return of any form of physical checkpoints or other infrastructure would be \"an alien concept\".  The PM said that her White Paper proposals, which would see the UK remain within the single market for goods and adopt a \"common rule book\" of regulations with the EU, represented a \"credible third option\" that would \"honour the Belfast Agreement, deliver on the referendum result and be good for our economy\".  In Brussels, Mr Barnier pointed out the Withdrawal Agreement could not be concluded without a legally binding backstop setting out the fall-back arrangements if a wider solution for the Irish border could not be found.  This, he stressed, would be based on the Commission\u0027s proposal but \"not necessarily\" stick precisely to the outline released in March."},{"url":null,"title":"dozens-of-major-scottish-infrastructure-projects-are-delayed-or-over-budget","story":"  Dozens of schools, hospitals, rail upgrades and roads have been subject to spiralling costs and overruns, sometimes racking up millions of pounds more than initially anticipated.  High-profile schemes to suffer setbacks include the \u0026pound1.35bn Queensferry Crossing, the new Aberdeen bypass and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children.  Meanwhile, the cost of the ongoing Edinburgh to Glasgow rail upgrade has soared by more than \u0026pound100m, the latest estimates show.  Impartial Holyrood researchers found 15 projects went over budget between November 2016 and March this year, while 29 had their estimated completion date pushed back.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the scale of the figures \u0026ldquoseriously calls into question the SNP\u0026rsquos handling of major infrastructure projects.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe already know the SNP government is putting billions of pounds of taxpayers\u0026rsquo money for public projects in the hands of private companies \u0026ndash and these figures show that people in Scotland are not getting value for money.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a wholescale review of public procurement in Scotland, including spending on major infrastructure projects.  \u0026ldquoPeople in Scotland deserve better than a policy that lines the pockets of shareholders only to leave important works delayed and over budget.  Research carried out by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), and commissioned by Labour, compared details for 48 major projects between 2016 and this year.  It found 33 of them saw their estimated budgets rise in that time or had their completion dates pushed back, or both \u0026ndash including 12 schools.  But the real figure may be even higher, as there are more than 80 schemes currently being advanced in which the Scottish Government is involved.  St Joseph\u0027s College in Dumfries cost \u0026pound10m more than expected in 2016, while Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh had its opening delayed multiple times and now needs a new extension because it can\u0026rsquot cope with booming school rolls.  Motorway improvement works on the M8, M73 and M74 cost \u0026pound13 million more, while a new hospital and healthcare facility on Orkney is currently \u0026pound10m over budget and delayed by five months.  Last year, NHS Lothian confirmed there would be further delays in the opening of the new Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh.  Of the projects examined by SPICe, only one \u0026ndash the A737 Dalry Bypass \u0026ndash saw its estimated cost drop between November 2016 and March this year. Two schools, Kelso High and Dunoon Primary, were completed earlier than expected.  Researchers said some cost increases could be due to a change in the scope of a project.  But Ms Baillie said the fact that financial and timescale details are only available for a limited number of schemes meant the figures \"could just be the tip of the iceberg\".  Ronnie Hunter, the former chairman of the Institution of Civil Engineers in Scotland, said there were a variety of reasons why projects might stumble into difficulties.  This could include bad weather, problems with ground conditions and late variations to a contract. Archaeological finds are also increasingly holding up work.  But Mr Hunter said in most modern contracts, the risk is increasingly borne by the contractor \u0026ndash meaning the public don\u0026rsquot shoulder the cost when things go wrong.  He said contractors are forced to pay \"liquidated damages\" if they run over agreed time frames.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no benefit to them of running over. There\u0026rsquos always a cost. It\u0026rsquos not in the contractor\u0026rsquos interests to be late.  \"The public are not paying for it \u0026ndash the public don\u0027t get use of the asset, but they don\u0027t pay for the cost of the overrun or the damages.  \u0026ldquoFor all these contracts that we have got, it\u0026rsquos not straightforward to say it\u0026rsquos a Scottish Government problem. It might be a contractor problem.  But he added: \u0026ldquoIt does seem quite a big number that do run over. That does seem odd.\"  He referenced the Queensferry Crossing, where delays incurred no cost to the public purse.  A Scottish Government spokesman said a number of \"significant projects\" were on course to be delivered this year.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to delivering critical infrastructure projects and have a strong record in this field, including major road improvements to the M8, M73 and M74, the Queensferry Crossing, which came in \u0026pound245m under budget and the new Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.  \u0026ldquoWhile it\u0026rsquos not uncommon to encounter challenges when delivering such a large number of ambitious projects of this size, scale and complexity, we have made excellent progress on our infrastructure plan, with further significant projects set to be completed this year. All of which is good for jobs, our economy and Scotland overall.  It comes amid widespread fears over the quality of construction work being carried out in Scotland.  A panel of experts recently found developers and contractors cannot be fully relied on to assess whether their buildings have been built to a high enough standard."},{"url":null,"title":"eus-michel-barnier-picks-major-holes-in-theresa-mays-brexit-plan","story":"  After Theresa May urged Brussels to \u0026ldquoevolve its thinking and stop coming up with unworkable proposals, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator underscored the fundamental obstacles to a Brexit deal with just 13 weeks of negotiating time to go.  Speaking after briefing ministers from the EU27 in Brussels, Mr Barnier opened his remarks by saying how the UK\u0026rsquos White Paper had created a way for \"constructive discussions\" on the post-Brexit relationship between Britain and the EU.  And he indicated Brussels was ready to amend its \"backstop\" proposals for the Irish border, which have become the biggest stumbling block in the talks.  But for most of his press conference the chief negotiator, without completely dismissing the Chequers Plan altogether, raised serious questions about key elements of it:  *noting how it only included alignment for goods checked at the border, he pointed out how rules on areas like pesticide used in the agri-food sector were not included. \u0026ldquoHow can we protect consumers in Europe?\" he asked.  *pointing to the plan to collect differing tariffs under the UK Government\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement, he asked: \"How can custom services verify the final destination of goods so that they apply the right tariff is there not a major risk of fraud?  *given the UK wants divergence on services \u0026ndash 80 per cent of its economy \u0026ndash how would the EU avoid \"unfair competition?\".  Mr Barnier declared: \"Our main aim is to protect the EU\u0027s single market to protect what we are.  Responding to the EU chief negotiator\u0026rsquos remarks, Labour\u0026rsquos Owen Smith, on behalf of the pro-EU Open Britain, said: \u0026ldquoMrs May\u0026rsquos July of horrors just got a lot worse as Mr Barnier made it clear her White Paper was a dead letter.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats claimed Mr Barnier had systematically torn apart the PM\u0027s White Paper and that the prospect of a \"catastrophic no-deal Brexit is becoming more concrete by the day\".  Earlier in Belfast, the Prime Minister insisted her compromise plan offered a \u0026ldquocoherent strategy and a \u0026ldquopractical working solution to delivering on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.  She made clear any UK Government could \u0026ldquonever accept that the way to prevent a hard border with Ireland is to create a new border within the United Kingdom to do so would also be a breach of the spirit of the Belfast Agreement, insisted Mrs May.  In Edinburgh, Jeremy Hunt diverged from his Cabinet colleague Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, who made clear that the Chequers Plan was the UK\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofinal offer and that if it were not accepted by Brussels, then there would be no deal.  The new Foreign Secretary described Britain\u0026rsquos White Paper as a \u0026ldquosubstantive offer, adding: \u0026ldquoIt should be the basis upon which a deal can be done. But it\u0026rsquos going to need imagination and flexibility to make sure that we continue to make progress.  Meanwhile, No 10 brushed aside the claim from Leo Varadkar that British aircraft would be barred from his country\u0027s airspace and \u0026ldquowould not fly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  A Downing Street spokeswoman insisted the Irish Taoiseach was \u0026ldquowrong, pointing out how so-called \"overflight rights\" were guaranteed by international treaties rather than EU membership.  Commenting on the day\u0026rsquos developments, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Council, tweeted: \u0026ldquoToday\u0027s aggressive comments by Messrs Varadkar and Barnier show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-michel-barnier-politely-but-forensically-picks-holes-in-theresa-mays-chequers-plan","story":"  The press conference began relatively well as the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator highlighted how 80 per cent of the deal with Britain had been done and that the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan had opened up the way to \u0026ldquoconstructive talks.  On that very fraught issue of the Irish border there were more positive-sounding words with Mr Barnier making clear what he was after might not turn out to be the EU\u0026rsquos offer but just a \u0026ldquoworkable plan.  He insisted the EU27 had no intention of creating a border down the Irish Sea \u0026ndash the reddest of Mrs May\u0026rsquos red lines \u0026ndash and stressed: \u0026ldquoWe can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop.  But after the positivity came the negativity and the chief negotiator\u0026rsquos catalogue of concerns from how the proposed reciprocity of tariff-collecting could lead to fraud and increased bureaucracy to how the alignment of rules on goods did not cover everything and so could endanger EU consumers.  There was also the little matter of how while the UK wanted divergence on goods, it did not want the same on services, which covered 80 per cent of its economy. Mr Barnier pulled out his mobile phone to illustrate how much of what this particular good contained was services.  If the Irish backstop is the fundamental element that could scupper the whole deal, then his promised flexibility on the issue might be a ray of sunshine that appears from behind a large dark cloud.  His key sentence was: \u0026ldquoThere will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop.\"  Indeed, the f-word was used by Jeremy Hunt, the new Foreign Secretary, who detracted from the take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum offered by his Cabinet colleague, Andrea Leadsom she had insisted the Chequers Plan was Britain\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofinal offer, rejection would mean no deal.  Mr Hunt told reporters in Edinburgh Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise was the \u0026ldquobasis upon which a deal can be done but added it was going to \u0026ldquoneed imagination and flexibility to make progress.  This weekend as Dominic Raab, the new Brexit Secretary, takes to the airwaves to emphasise his desire to \u0026ldquointensify the talks with Brussels, time is beginning to zip by - and with it the chances of getting a deal."},{"url":null,"title":"julian-smith-and-brandon-lewis-join-theresa-may-in-a-would-i-lie-to-you-special","story":"  The opposing team is conspicuous by its absence but there should be plenty here from Team May. They might all be on the same side \u0026ndash but you\u0026rsquod hardly know it.  Let\u0026rsquos introduce the players.  Captain first: Theresa \u0026ldquoHonestly, it was an honest mistake May. She\u0026rsquos determined to win \u0026ndash even if the losers are the British public.  She\u0026rsquoll be playing against her own side, but can her teammates convince her they\u0026rsquore playing it straight? Or only playing fast and loose?  First up, Esther McVey, former disability minister who pledged to root out the \u0026ldquobogus disabled. Ms McVey, now Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has said the Universal Credit system will create \u0026ldquoan agile service. As agile as her ability to present alternative truths.  Julian Smith, Chief Whip, joining them. Mr Smith seems to have no concerns about lying to a colleague who\u0026rsquos on maternity leave \u0026ndash so why the pregnant pause before Mrs May does the right thing and sacks him?  Brandon Lewis MP. You might have been trying to help, Mr Lewis, but you\u0026rsquove left your captain holding the baby.  And Andrea Leadsom. John Bercow has asked us to clarify that his words were \u0026ldquoa far from stupid woman. Mrs Leadsom\u0026rsquos new complaints scheme for MPs and peers grants anonymity to honourable members being investigated for wrongdoing, including harassment and expenses fraud.  Voting for legislation to cover up their own misdoings: what a beautiful demonstration of the current contempt politicians hold for their citizens.  Now for the Quick-Fire Lies round.  Ms McVey wilfully misled Parliament by insisting a highly critical National Audit Office report said there were no problems with the implementation of the Universal Credit system. Demonstrating agility, she has now admitted there are continuing problems.  \u0026ldquoWhere we need to put our hands up, she said, \u0026ldquoWe will do.  Mr Smith and Mr Lewis have insisted they broke the \u0026ldquopairing arrangement on a knife-edge Brexit customs union vote on Tuesday, which the Government won by six votes, in \u0026ldquoerror.  Mrs May said the agreement was broken in an \u0026ldquohonest mistake. Would the Prime Minister clarify \u0026ldquomistake, given she once said leaving the EU would be a mistake but now is Brexit champion?  To the Homes Truths round.  The foreign secretary tried to draw the limelight to himself during a constitutional crisis, even when a British citizen had been killed on home soil by an apparently foreign nerve agent.  A cabinet minister has deliberately given false information to parliament but escaped with barely a slapped wrist when the victims of her sustained bungling would have had their benefits sanctioned.  Two politicians have cheated a system of parliamentary fairness yet days later are still in post with the PM obfuscating about their actions.  While the Government is rapidly losing any respect from or credibility with the people it serves, MPs have voted to give themselves anonymity when investigated for wrongdoing.  This lackadaisical approach towards the truth, towards fairness and towards respect for its citizenry comes from a Government in need, more than ever, of facing up to inconvenient truths.  Who\u0026rsquos the winner? None of them, of course.

But according to reports the party may be taking place in the Caribbean, as William and Kate are rumoured to have taken their children on a summer break to the exclusive island of Mustique.  George has made a number of eventful public appearances over the past 12 months, from starting school to a cheeky moment on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony, as the royal family celebrated the Queen\u0026rsquos official birthday.  But he can sometimes appear a little shy and reluctant in front of the cameras \u0026ndash understandable for a young boy who is slowly getting to grips with life in the limelight.  Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge was born at the private maternity unit of St Mary\u0026rsquos Hospital, Paddington, the Lindo Wing, at 4.24pm on July 22, 2013, weighing 8lbs 6oz.  He made his public debut in front of the world\u0026rsquos media on the hospital steps one day later, wrapped in a white merino wool shawl, cradled in his proud parents\u0026rsquo arms.  A great-grandchild to the Queen, he will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England if, as expected, his reign follows those of the Prince of Wales, then William.  A few months after his last birthday George started his first day at school with his father, but without his mother, Kate. She was experiencing severe morning sickness as she was pregnant with Prince Louis.  The duke managed his parenting duties alone and said later: \u0026ldquoIt went well. There was one other parent who had more of an issue with their children \u0026ndash so I was quite pleased I wasn\u0026rsquot the one.  The youngster has just completed his first year at school, attending Thomas\u0026rsquos Battersea in south London.  He even played a sheep in his school\u0026rsquos Christmas nativity play, and loves helicopters, flying and is obsessed with all things police-related.  When baby brother Louis was born he joined younger sister Princess Charlotte outside the Lindo Wing in April as they visited their new brother with their father.  In June George and his family joined the Queen and other royals on Buckingham Palace\u0026rsquos balcony as the monarch\u0026rsquos official birthday celebrations drew to a close with the traditional fly-past.  But the young prince was seen playing up with seven-year-old Savannah, the daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips, who jokingly put her hand over his mouth.  George was last seen at the christening of his baby brother Louis at the Chapel Royal at St James\u0026rsquos Palace on July 9, and in official photos marking the royal baptism."},{"url":null,"title":"airport workers accept pay offer","story":"        Workers at Aberdeen International Airport have accepted a three per cent pay offer by company management.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility.

The association was formed in 1888.She also holds the mixed tandem record with Andy \u0026ldquoIron Man Wilkinson.Meanwhile, Moray long-distance runner Don Ritchie, who held the record between John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Land\u0026rsquos End, has died at the age of 73. He did the run in 1989 in 10 days, 15 hours and 27 minutes.The feat was achieved in what were described as \u0026ldquochallenging conditions. Mr Ritchie developed bronchitis and endured stomach and chest pains as well as regular nosebleeds as he ran his way into the record books.Mr Mowat said: \u0026ldquoHe was also the last Scot to hold the record which stood until 1996 when it was broken with a time of 10 days, two hours and 25 minutes by Richard Brown.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116742.jpg","title":"Prince Charles to visit Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspThe prince \u0026ndash also known as the Duke of Rothesay \u0026ndash is a regular visitor to the region, and last visited in 2017 when he did an impromptu tour of the various marquees at the Mey Highland and Cultural Games.Earlier this year, the future king declared himself a fan of the Groat, namechecking it as one of three newspapers he has \u0026ldquoenjoyed keeping in touch with.On Friday, the duke will visit Kongsberg Maritime, an important employer in Wick started by local entrepreneurs who trained at Dounreay.The company manufactures underwater cameras and harsh environment CCTV systems for subsea applications within different markets ranging from oil and gas, remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) technology, civil engineering and aquaculture.It employs and trains local people in skilled engineering and IT positions and was recently acquired by Imenco, a Norwegian company established in 1979.His royal highness will meet staff and have an opportunity to view the production process and see examples of the technology to learn about its application across the world.The duke is also scheduled to attend the young entrepreneurs and businesses event at Mackay\u0026rsquos Hotel.The event, organised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce and part of a series of events that take place throughout the year, aims to celebrate young entrepreneurs in the county and provide a networking opportunity with mentors and the agencies responsible for assisting and promoting business start-ups and entrepreneurship.There, he will meet civic leaders, chamber representatives, young business attendees and support agencies.In May, Prince Charles stressed his support for local newspapers, saying they \u0026ldquoprovide a vital service which is as important now as it has ever been.\u0026ldquoThese papers, and hundreds like them around the country, highlight so many of the important aspects of local community life in a way that no other media could hope to do, he said in a letter to marketing service Local Media Works.\u0026ldquoThere are countless examples of local newspapers acting as powerful and effective champions for their communities, and very often it is the local media that are first to a story and who stay with it long after the national media have moved on.\u0026ldquoLocal journalism is about giving communities a voice and empowering people with the knowledge to make informed decisions.\"Sometimes, a good local newspaper communicates the aspirations or concerns of the local community to a wider audience, putting local issues on the national agenda.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sutherland gets spaceport nod","story":"Sutherland has been selected as the site of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport.The UK Space Agency says the new site on the Mhoine peninsula - betweenTongue and Durness - was chosen as it is the best place in the UKto reach in-demand satellite orbits with vertically launched rockets.Initial funding of \u0026pound2.5 million will go to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) to develop the site, which will use a combination of proven and innovativerocket technologies to pave the way for a world-leading spaceflight market.It is expected to be up and running by the early 2020s and will createhundreds of jobs.The spaceport will develop the UK space economy through regular, reliable and responsible access to space.HIE Chief Executive Charlotte Wright has welcomed the decision, calling it \"tremendous news for our region and for Scotland as a whole\".\"The international space sector is growing and we want to ensure theregion is ready to reap the economic benefits that will be generated from thisfantastic opportunity.\"Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution Derek Mackay MSP said:\"The development of a small-satellite launch facility at Mhoine, Sutherland is a significant first step towards stimulating space sector activity across the whole of Scotland and beyond.\"This very exciting development will build on our existing strengthsand ensure we maintain momentum in the development of vibrant spaceindustry.\u0026nbsp\"A spaceport will open up a wide range of market opportunities and giveour businesses a competitive advantage to keep us ahead of the curve.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Saturday 21 Jul 2018 9:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaSaturday 21 Jul 2018 9:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770822.1531988489!/image/image.jpg","title":"business stream looking to make waves with sales and marketing director","story":"        Water supplier Business Stream has hired a sales and marketing director from a rival business.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771968.1532111485!/image/image.jpg","title":"jane bradley the sad end of this sporting life","story":"        Top athletes and sportspeople can find it difficult to come to terms with the end of their career, writes Jane Bradley.                It is Saturday morning. All over the country, right as you’re reading this, thousands of young people will be practising sport.            You may be a parent, grandparent or friend of one of the dedicated young sportsmen or women. You might have picked this up to help while away the time waiting for them in a leisure centre in Edinburgh, or Stirling, or Thurso - while your offspring completes lengths of the pool, swings in circles from a pair of gymnastics rings, or practices their double-handed backhand. You might be waiting by an ice rink in Dundee, watching sit spins and spirals or at the side of a rugby pitch in Melrose while your son or daughter launches themselves into a ruck.            While some of these young people are doing all of this entirely for fun or fitness,  others will harbour dreams of a sporting career. A proportion of those will dedicate their childhood and teenage years to trying to get to the top of their profession, while an even smaller number will actually make it to competing at a high level. For the ones who do make it to the Olympic Games, it is all too easy to assume they have made it, reached their final goal.Yet a first-person account from a retiring athlete made me think hard this week about the difficulties of what happens next. Most sports people – with some exceptions, showjumper John Whitaker is still contemplating the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, when he will be 64 – reach the pinnacle of their careers by their early 30s. The question is, then what?In a week when retired sprinter Usain Bolt looks set to sign for an Australian football club, Edinburgh-based Team GB Olympic swimmer Lizzie Simmonds published a blog post about retiring from competitive swimming aged 27.READ MORE: Justin Gatlin gatecrashes Usain Bolt’s farewell partyIn a piece called “How to be a real person”, Simmonds – who hit the headlines earlier this year after tweeting about an exchange with a woman in a swimming pool in the capital who had told her that she was so good she should consider joining a club team – writes of the struggles of moving from a regimented and focused daily life into the real world.            “Lots of athletes get into trouble when they leave elite sport, and it’s not too difficult to understand why. After being identified as ‘Lizzie the swimmer’ for so long, I’ve just morphed into ‘Lizzie the normal person’,” she wrote.“If, like me, an athlete has often defined themselves by their successes in sport, then it can be difficult to surrender their hard-won identity in the search for a new one.”She has a point. We see them, standing there on the podium, medals around their necks and assume that they have it made. Yet managing to merely financially survive in competitive sport is a feat in itself – for many without lucrative endorsement and sponsorship deals, there is little room for financial planning for the future.Athlete Jesse Owens, who scooped four golds at the 1936 Olympics, famously defended his decision to move into racehorse training for the money after retiring from running, saying: “I had four gold medals, but you can’t eat four gold medals.”            In addition, the psychological impact of carving out a life doing the thing that you love – and the only job you have known – then finding it has come to an end cannot be easy and sport as an industry is beginning to realise that. Sport Scotland employs dedicated ‘performance lifestyle advisers’ to help athletes through transitions, while Abertay University in Dundee two years ago appointed the world’s first ever professor of duty of care in sport.READ MORE: Olympic heroes, no 3: Jesse OwensThere are, of course, those who can keep on competing. Golfers, particularly, have access to a lucrative Masters tour, through which many can earn a decent amount of cash up to retirement age. But for long jumpers or javelin throwers, the spectator dollar is not likely to be as forthcoming.Some retired athletes manage to move on to teaching, training or reporting. They are elite athletes, with decades of experience in a very specific field. Yet, even for those who are able to remain within the sector in some way, life is never quite the same. While coaching – or joining sports-related organisations, or becoming commentators or pundits – might mean a chance to keep on wearing the trainers, kicking the ball, wearing the skates or at least talking the talk, it is simply not the same as actually taking part. Which is why many former athletes move into something else entirely.            Back in the days when rugby was non-professional – this only changed fully in 1995 – players would have kept “normal” jobs the whole time, which they could easily step back into after their sporting career came to an end. Many were dentists, lawyers or, like Scottish rugby player John Jeffrey, a farmer.In other sports, George Foreman is probably almost better known now for his cooking grill than his boxing success, while British hockey player Crista Cullen, who came out of retirement to take part in the Rio games in 2016 after winning gold in London 2012, now works in conservation in Kenya.My sympathy is with Simmonds as she transforms into a “normal person”. It can’t be easy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771972.1532111569!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment finally scotland has some good news to celebrate","story":"        Scotland had 3.2 million overseas tourists last year, equivalent to 60 per cent of its population.                In a time of Brexit, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, austerity and an economy that seems eternally peely-wally, it feels like a long time since Scotland had some really good news, something to celebrate.            But finally, we do, with the numbers of tourists flocking to Scotland last year almost appearing to be too good to be true.            There were a staggering 3.2 million overseas visitors to Scotland last year, setting a new all-time record. Just think about that figure – it’s the equivalent of almost 60 per cent of the Scottish population.And they spent a record £2.3 billion, up by 23 per cent on the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics, helping to sustain an industry that employs more than 200,000 people.The popularity of the TV series Outlander is said to be one reason why as people flock to see the castles and glens where the Jacobites and Hanoverians once fought to the death. But some might suggest a 17 per cent rise in the number of European tourists could be something to do with Scotland’s strong support for Remain in the EU referendum, particularly when the overall figure for the UK remained about the same.READ MORE: Donald Anderson: How a tourist tax would help Edinburgh stay great            However, while all this is good news for the economy, large numbers of people do bring some challenges. Congestion can be just as big a problem in popular rural areas during the summer as it is in the cities, perhaps even more so given it’s less expected.So the Scottish Government and local councils need to work hard to make sure tourist hotspots are able to cope with the extra influx of people. For example, if our transport network becomes overloaded, those tourists may decide to go elsewhere and local frustrations may grow. And more work could be done to encourage visitors to travel to less well-kent but equally beautiful parts of the country, which would benefit their local economies and take some of the pressure on the busiest places.And tourism isn’t only good business for hotels, restaurants and the like. It is also a key part of Scotland’s image on the world stage. A holidaymaker who has a lovely time visiting Edinburgh Castle, wild-swimming in Loch Ness and getting a selfie with the Harry Potter bridge – sorry, the Glenfinnan Viaduct – in the background might decide Scotland would make a great place to live, to be a student or to start a new business.READ MORE: Alexander McCall Smith: Save Edinburgh from tourism boom"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772007.1532114342!/image/image.jpg","title":"stay informed top 10 opinions of the week","story":"        The Scotsman is publishing a selection of its best opinion articles from the previous seven days to showcase some of the most insightful writing in Scottish journalism.                Ruth Davidson’s barnstorming attack on Donald Trump created headlines in other newspapers after she accused the US President of “desperate – and dangerous – sycophancy” towards Vladimir Putin.            “Nothing attracted a wannabe strong man, it seems, than thuggish strength,” she wrote, adding that Putin’s regime was “contemptuous of international law and our democratic way of life”.             But she said Trump would not bring about the end of Western democracy as we know it because those fighting to preserve our hard-earned freedoms would ultimately prevail.READ MORE: Ruth Davidson: Putin-sycophant Trump will never destroy Western democracyLesley Riddoch also had a thing or two to say about Trump, saying reports that he “totally hates” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were essentially a feather in her cap.“Whether the head of state is North Korea’s Kim Jong Un or Germany’s Angela Merkel, [Trump] flatters and insults by turn, aiming to destabilise rivals in the run-up to important trade talks. But hate? That’s an emotion largely reserved for his own former members of staff ... and now it seems the First Minister. That’s no mean feat.”By taking part in Scotland’s largest gay pride march in Glasgow during Trump’s visit, Sturgeon delivered an “indirect rebuke” to the US president as this allowed her to “contrast a society which ‘champions equality and fairness at all times’ with Trump’s America where transgender people are banned from the US military and LGBTI content has been removed from US government websites, including an apology to gay people persecuted in the 1950s and 60s”.

The need for unlikely alliances in these strange times was the theme of Joyce McMillan’s column.\u2028“We are ... in a situation where those who want to combat the rising tide of racism, xenophobia, institutional collapse and jingoistic brutalism across the West now have to shape up, pick their side, and put an end to pointless disputes about who, among the opponents of Trump, Brexit and all that they bring in their wake, has the best claim to perfect political virtue. “Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows,” says Shakespeare in The Tempest and all our futures may depend on our ability to see that new times also demand new alliances, and a willingness to stop being distracted from the main task by increasingly irrelevant arguments,” she wrote.READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliances vital to stop Brexit disasterDarren McGarvey, The Scotsman’s Orwell Prize-winning columnist, had an unusual take on the US President, warning that we all have an “inner Trump”.             “For me, Trump is a mirror, a mirror in which I see clearly the kind of man I am capable of being should I become unvigilant in the face of my glaring absurdities,” he wrote.And, with the searing honesty for which he has become well known, he added: “Drunk and sober, I’ve behaved poorly. I’ve lied to people to preserve a false self-image. I’ve mistreated those I love, whether family, friends or partners in relationships. I’ve engaged in ‘locker-room banter’ and co-signed misogynistic and racist ‘jokes’. For me to get up on stage and pretend I’m some paragon of virtue would be to engage in the very hubristic nonsense for which ‘The Donald’ is infamous.“I did all those things, without a modicum of self-awareness, because the ego I constructed to fortify my demoralising insecurities was so huge that when it came time to hear a bit of sobering truth, I was ill-equipped to take incoming calls. I wonder how many people, at these rallies across the country, are pondering similarly uncomfortable truths about themselves?”READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Beware your inner Trump, the monster inside us allJohn McLellan, a Conservative councillor and former Scotsman editor, pulled no punches as he tore into fellow Tory Ross Thomson on the issue of our times, Brexit. The Aberdeen South MP had attacked Theresa May’s Brexit plan, claiming it would turn the UK into a “vassal state”, and praised Boris Johnson and David Davis for “standing by their principles” and resigning from the Cabinet.             McLellan suggested this appeared to be “a pitch to be Scotland Secretary in PM Bojo’s Barmy Cabinet”. He pointed to a different take on Johnson’s character by Max Hastings, the ex-editor of the Daily , who wrote that it was a “common mistake to suppose Johnson a nice man ... he is a man of remarkable gifts, flawed by an absence of conscience, principle or scruple”.“The aim for Team May, if I may be so bold, should be to get Brexit over the line, and the word from people a lot closer to this than me beyond the Conservative Party is that the key principles laid out in the Chequers blueprint, like customs alignment for manufactured goods and the end of free movement, are very close to doing just that.”READ MORE: John McLellan: Bojo’s Barmy Army is polishing a t**dBrian Monteith, however, took a rather different stance. The public were being “taken for fools by the Prime Minister”, he wrote. \u2028“There are only two viable positions for our country, or indeed any country: being fully in the European Union or being fully out. Anything else is a self-deceiving construct that in time brings servitude to what the EU wants,” he argued.“May has failed to make Brexit mean Brexit. If she will not resign and go gracefully her colleagues must remove her.”READ MORE: Brian Monteith: If May doesn’t go, she must be removed – or voters will remove ToriesBut there were columnists who, somehow, managed to find things other than Brexit and Trump to write about. Susan Dalgety, on an epic clockwise trip around the entire mainland United States, arrived in New Orleans, a city that has an unusual attitude towards death. The Museum of Death warns visitors to prepare themselves as there have been a number of what it calls “falling down ovations” – people fainting. After recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the city has returned to being a place famed for its non-stop party atmosphere. “At four in the afternoon, the party was in full swing. James, squeezed into a silver, sequinned jacket three sizes too small, was drinking Bud from a champagne flute, while handing out stuffed toys from a large bag under his seat. ‘He always does that, he’s got a big heart,’ explained Cordell, who came back from the bathroom with a penguin,” wrote Dalgety in the latest instalment of what is a wonderful series of reports.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The party city where only musicians keep timeAdmitting this might be seen as “heresy” by some, Kenny MacAskill, Scotland’s former Justice Secretary, called for fellow Nationalists to push for a second Brexit referendum, which he was confident would be won by the Remain camp, before another one on independence.“The political circumstances of Brexit aren’t good for the independence cause and most certainly not a hard Brexit ... An implosion of the economy and collapse in living standards aren’t the best circumstances for a confident people to vote for independence. Suggestions that Scots will see no alternative to leaving the UK are offset by worries that when things are grim they ‘hold on to nurse for fear of something worse’. I’ve never believed that the worse it gets the more folk are likely to vote for independence. No! Sorry, the worse it gets, heads go down and hope fades!” he argued.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Nationalists must push for Brexitref 2 before Indyref 2Bill Jamieson had a fairly scary warning for the BBC – that it could cease to exist as we know it within five to ten years. The rise of Netflix, Amazon Prime and other global giants of entertainment posed an existential threat to Aunty Beeb, he claimed, while bemoaning the number of repeats.“The BBC’s ... authority has all but gone. Broadcast rivals are no longer reliant on advertising for their income but can raise massive amounts by subscription. The BBC and its £150.50-a-year license fee system has wilted under the assault. It still has the capacity to create stunning and opinion-changing programmes such as Blue Planet, and mount great documentaries and prize-winning historical drama. But why are viewers deserting in their millions? Netflix is capable of mounting first-class drama such as The Crown and House of Cards. Check into a hotel and the likelihood is your room TV will default to Sky News,” he wrote.

People drop names with charming regularity in the Mississippi Delta.            The bluesman who entertained us over breakfast in Clarksdale, birthplace of the blues, is friends with John Lennon’s sister.            “I got a lovely note from Paul McCartney congratulating me on my album of Beatles’ songs, he loved our version of Lady Madonna,” he smiled, before sliding into another three-minute classic.“I drive Carla Thomas a lot,” said Rufus (no relation), our cheerful cab driver in Memphis, “and if you’re around on Sunday, go down to Al Green’s church, he is still singing as well as preachin’.”Al Green, the man whose soulful voice has spread love and happiness across the world, is clearly very popular. “I spent five hours with Reverend Green yesterday,” said Gordon, the man we bumped into in BB King’s club on Beale Street.“And I was with Zelma earlier this week, talkin’ about her music academy. That’s Zelma Redding,” he added quickly, just in case we hadn’t worked out she was the widow of the legendary Otis Redding.There is music in the air in this sultry corner of the United States.            It was here, in the cotton fields of the south, that African American sharecroppers sang ancient rhythms in the blistering heat to ease their breaking souls, while their poor, white neighbours plucked country tunes on cheap guitars.It was in Clarksdale where one Robert Johnson, so the story goes, met the devil at a crossroads, and the blues was born. Muddy Waters was raised in the same small town, as was Ike Turner, the man credited with writing the first rock’n’roll song, ‘Rocket 88’.And it was in Memphis that an introverted, rather strange 19-year-old man picked up his battered guitar one summer’s night in 1954, sang an old blues number ‘That’s all right (Mama)’, and changed the world forever. They say all roads lead to Memphis, and in Memphis all roads lead to Graceland, the home of that young man, Elvis Aron Presley.            Elvis bought the modest mansion in 1957, and he lived there until his sad, lonely death only 20 years later at the age of 42. It is now one of most visited historical houses in America, second only to the White House.It is unexpectedly poignant. He had clearly tried to create a haven of peace here, a home where he and his family and friends could hide from the suffocating fame that eventually killed him. Even the vicious green shag-pile carpet in his infamous den seemed comforting.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The party city where only musicians keep timeGrowing up with the Beatles, then Bowie, I used to think Elvis Presley was an old-fashioned crooner, someone your auntie liked, a hillbilly rocker with greasy hair who starred in cheesy films.I had no idea that before Elvis, blues music was played by black people, country by their white neighbours, and gospel by both, but never together.            I was blind to the fact that, before Elvis, radio stations and record labels, like everything in the south, were divided by colour.It was Elvis, guided by the effervescent record producer Sam Phillips, who, as if by magic, merged the blues, country and gospel and created the soundtrack to the modern world.He didn’t “steal” black music, as some have accused him. He absorbed it from an early age, growing up in poor neighbourhoods in Tupelo, then Memphis.He lived and breathed rhythm and blues. He had soul. And a voice that Placido Domingo yearned for: “His was the one voice I wish to have had,” said the tenor.Memphis is also home to Stax Records, the label that produced some of the best soul music of the 20th century.Stax was home to legends like Isaac Hayes, Carla Thomas and her father Rufus, Booker T and the MGs, and the almost mythical Otis Redding.Otis died aged only 26 years old, when his plane crashed into a lake in Wisconsin. He had yet to finish his biggest hit, ‘Sittin’ on the Dock of a Bay’, but listening now the whistled verse seems an integral part of the classic record.And his legacy lives on, even beyond the beautiful music he made. The annual Otis Music Camps provide young people with soul and music education, and his wife, Zelma is opening a charter school in his birthplace of Macon, Georgia, later this year.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: USA – a land born of racism and slavery returns to its rootsIt aims to “empower students to maximise their full potential through integration of arts and academics”. Just as the Soulsville Charter school does in South Memphis. It is the legacy of Stax Records, which folded in 1975, and is now considered the best public school in the state.These schools may never produce another Elvis or Otis, but that is not their aim. They want to create “well-rounded and well-prepared leaders for a world of tomorrow” – leaders with soul.The man currently in charge of the country is creating a cacophony all of his own. Since Trump’s controversial meeting with Vladimir Putin on Monday, the airwaves here have been jumping. Words like treason and traitor are being used by respected, usually measured, commentators to describe the President of the United States.The former director of the CIA, John Brennan, was apoplectic at what he saw as his commander-in-chief’s betrayal, tweeting that Trump’s press conference with Putin was “nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???”The country is in the midst of a nervous breakdown. Not even the soothing tones of the Reverend Al Green could calm it down just now.But a few thousand miles away in sunny South Africa, a middle-aged, grey-haired African American got to his feet, and a familiar voice resonated across the oceans. “Keep believing. Keep marching. Keep building. Keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world,” said President Barack Obama, in his speech to mark Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday. “We don’t just need one leader ... what we badly need is that collective spirit. “Mandela said young people are capable when aroused of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom. Now is a good time to be aroused.”Amen brother, amen."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771902.1532102301!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit what happens if britain leaves the eu with no deal","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        With just months until Britain leaves the EU, political differences on the terms of Brexit are still rife and Scotland remains at odds with Westminster over the terms of any deal.                The UK faces crashing out without a deal if the bloc rejects its plans.             In fact, hardcore Brexiteers in Conservative ranks are increasingly saying a “no deal” Brexit would be better than a soft Brexit.             So possible is the outcome that both the UK and the EU have issued guidance on their preparations for a no deal scenario.READ MORE: Scotland’s Brexit battle with UK backed by Northern Ireland and WalesREAD MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliances vital to stop Brexit disasterWhat is a ‘no deal’ Brexit? A “no deal” Brexit does what it says on the tin. It means the UK and the EU would be unable to reach a withdrawal agreement.             If no agreement can be made, it means there would be no 21-month transition period, which Theresa May is currently proposing. If that was the case, consumers, businesses and public bodies would have to respond immediately to changes as result of leaving the EU.  “On 29 March next year, the UK would leave the EU and everything associated with that would come to an end,” says Dr Simon Usherwood, a reader in politics at the University of Surrey. “[A no deal] doesn’t stop the UK leaving but it means there is absolutely no clarity about what happens.”             While it is a possibility, in reality neither the UK nor the EU would favour a no deal because it signals a poor political relationship, he adds. One of the key issues with a no deal scenario is the uncertainty it would lead to for life and work in Britain.So what would actually happen with no deal? Trade The UK would revert to World Trade Organisation rules on trade.             While Britain would no longer be bound by EU rules, it would have to face the EU’s external tariffs. The price of goods in shops for Britons could go up as businesses would have to place tariffs on goods imported from the EU. Some British-made products may be rejected by the EU as new authorisation and certification might be required. Manufacturers could move their operations to the EU to avoid delays in components coming across the border. People The UK would be free to set its own controls on immigration by EU nationals and the bloc could do the same for Britons. There could be long delays at borders if passport and customs checks are heightened.  The fate of expats – there are 1.3 million Britons in EU countries and 3.7 million Europeans in Britain – in terms of their rights to live and work would be unclear. Professionals working in the EU might find their qualifications are no longer recognised, meaning they are no longer able to practice. Flights to the EU could be grounded as the necessary safety confirmations to cover both ends of the journey might not be in place. Laws Relevant EU laws would be transferred over so there would be no black holes in Britain’s lawbook. Britain would no longer have to adhere to the rulings of the European Court of Justice but it would be bound to the European Court of Human Rights, a non-EU body. Money The Government would not have to pay the annual £13 billion contribution to the EU budget. However Britain would lose out on some EU subsidies – the Common Agricultural Policy gives £3 billion to farmers. The Irish border The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic would remain unresolved. While physical infrastructure has been vetoed, the border would become an external frontier for the EU in the event of a no deal Brexit. There would be pressure to enforce customs and immigration controls.Would UK be able to broker trade agreements with other countries? The current deal on the table would allow Britain to start trade negotiations with other countries after 29 March 2019 but any deals would not be implemented until after the transition period of 21 months. With a no deal, Britain could implement the deals whenever the fine print is ready. But deals take years, not months or weeks, to broker. Therefore the UK is not gaining anything by having no transition period in this instance. “It’s worth making the point that trade deals are about agreements with states. If the UK left without a deal showing it was unable to have constructive conversations with close trading partners [the EU], it would not be a great incentive for third parties,” says Dr Usherwood.This story first featured on our sister site the i."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772027.1532118789!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may s brexit plans questioned by eu chief barnier","story":"        The EU\u0026#8217s chief Brexit negotiator has questioned whether the Prime Minister Theresa May\u0026#8217s proposals for customs arrangements are workable, in his first public response to last week\u0026#8217s white paper.                Speaking after briefing ministers from the 27 remaining EU states in Brussels yesterday, Michel Barnier said the white paper has opened the way for “constructive discussions” on the post-Brexit relationship between the EU and the UK.            He indicated the EU was ready to amend its “backstop” proposals for the Irish border, which have become the biggest stumbling block in talks.            He said there were elements of the plan agreed by the Cabinet earlier this month at Chequers which the European Commission did not understand, and said further discussions would be needed over the coming weeks to establish how much “common ground” exists between London and Brussels.Mrs May’s proposal for a “facilitated customs arrangement” opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses, he said.Tory arch-Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Barnier’s “aggressive” comments “show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union”.Mr Barnier was speaking shortly after Mrs May issued a challenge to Brussels to “evolve” its negotiating position in response to the publication of her Brexit blueprint.In her first major Brexit speech since the wave of ministerial resignations which followed her Chequers deal, the Prime Minister described the proposals as “a significant development of our position … a coherent package”.            And she said: “It is now for the EU to respond – not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.“And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.”Speaking in Belfast, Mrs May also took aim at critics from the hard Brexit wing of the Conservative Party, accusing them of being ready to “betray” the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic.She took on the argument of prominent Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who say the UK should simply declare it will impose no checks on its side of the Irish border and leave it to Brussels to decide whether to require the Republic to erect barriers on the other. Mrs May restated her implacable opposition to the EU backstop, which she said would involve the creation of a customs border within the UK, which was “something I will never accept”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772036.1532119195!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp slammed as queensferry crossing work to continue for another 18 months","story":"        Work on the Queensferry Crossing will not be completed until the end of next year, ministers have admitted.                The news follows drivers over the River Forth suffering months of delays from snagging work, which was due to be finished in September.            However, new transport secretary Michael Matheson has revealed that painting the underside of the road deck will not now be finished until December 2019.            This is because of delays installing a platform to ensure the safety of workers in all weathers.It means the finishing touches will not be put to the bridge until more than two years after it opened last August.Last November, it was revealed that off-peak lane closures would continue for ten months to finish the project.But Mr Matheson said the painting work would not affect drivers.He said contractors building the £1.35 billion crossing had “confirmed that undertaking this work will not compromise the use or integrity of the structure and traffic flow will not be impacted”. In a letter to Holyrood’s rural economy and connectivity committee, he said: “Whilst Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC) have provided their firm assurance that the work will be completed, they have requested a relaxation of the delivery timescale to deliver the work in the most economical manner possible, allowing them to better manage available resources.            “In this context, and in the knowledge the work will be completed at no additional cost to the public purse, I consider it appropriate that additional time is permitted to allow the contractor to work in the most economical fashion and to complete the works by the end of 2019.”Mr Matheson said his officials had been assured by FCBC they were on schedule to complete the rest of the 23-point snagging and finishing list by September. It includes lighting, drainage and concrete work.Last November, one carriageway was closed for five days for repairs after surfacing around expansion joints was laid too highTransport Scotland had said the snagging work would have a “minimal impact” on traffic.            However, drivers have complained that even late evening Edinburgh-Fife trips have taken twice as long as normal because of lane closures.John Baxter tweeted: “What’s going on with Queensferry Crossing? It’s back to looking like a building site. What a mess and many delays.”Peter C tweeted: “10pm. Long queue when you just want to get home! Finish this bridge!”Neil Greig, of motoring group IAM RoadSmart, said: “Despite assurances on traffic flow being unaffected, any activity around the bridge could cause delay due to distraction or extra works vehicle movement. Although it is absolutely essential the builders get everything right, these ongoing uncertainties are not good for people and businesses trying to plan ahead.“Traffic management around the bridge also needs to be constantly reviewed to maximise the benefits of the massive investment in this new iconic structure.            “So far, a few extra days of unlimited operation during high winds seems little reward for drivers who still find themselves in long queues every morning and evening.”Scottish Labour transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: “The Scottish Government have consistently claimed the crossing would be completed by September, so it is hugely frustrating this work will drag on for another year.“The SNP are quick to pat themselves on the back when it comes to the crossing, but they’ve been slow admitting to the yet more delays and the failure of the contract to deliver on time.”His Scottish Conservatives counterpart Jamie Greene said: “In its first year, the bridge has been subject to constant congestion and lane closures as contractors perform vital work that should have already been completed.“Minor works on infra-\u2028structure projects are expected, but given the time it is \u2028taking to complete them, it raises questions about whether the bridge was opened too early.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “It was always our intention to open the bridge at the earliest opportunity to ensure the benefits of a more reliable crossing over the Forth could be realised quickly.“FCBC has informed us they intend to complete all outstanding work, apart from under deck painting, by the end of September.“All of this work forms part of the original contract and there is no additional cost to the public purse.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772033.1532119050!/image/image.jpg","title":"girlguides ditch home making for mixology in culture change","story":"        Generations of Girlguides learnt how to be a hostess and operate a radio, but now these traditional badges are to be ditched in favour of 21st century pursuits such as vlogging, human rights, mixology and mindfulness.                In the biggest overhaul in Girlguiding history, traditional badges are to be consigned to the past, and replaced with 72 new ones designed to help young girls “take on the world”, the charity has announced.            The new programme of badges and activities fall under six themes – express myself, be well, know myself, skills for my future, have adventures and take action, it said.            Badges for Guides – girls aged ten to 14 – include mixology, which will involve using different fruits, juices, herbs and spices to create a drink. Others for the age group include vlogging, human rights and personal brand.One of the three archaeology badges for Brownies (seven to ten-year-olds) is to go on a dig, find three objects and think about who they may have belonged to.And the zero waste badge for Brownies involves coming up with ideas for how to save water.Other new badges for Brownies are aviation, mindfulness, my rights and baking, while Rainbows – the youngest Girlguiding group made up of five to seven-year-olds – could study for badges in healthy minds and recycling.Rangers – young women aged 14 to 18 – could study for a badge in women’s rights, festival goer or entrepreneur.            There are 12 new badges for Rainbows, 18 for Brownies, 24 for Guides and 18 for Rangers, and overall, there are 800 new badges and activities. As part of the revamp, traditional badges such as hostess are being retired, Girlguiding said, although some elements and activities will be included in the new badges and activities – for example, skills such as event planning and meal preparation.Volunteer Jess Bond, who worked on developing the programme, said: “We’ve really listened to what girls have told us they’d like to see and incorporated their suggestions, creating new badges and activities and updating others so they’re relevant now and in the future.“We’ve always moved with the times and we hope to welcome even more members to Girlguiding with this diverse range of activities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.

It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH1307NCA.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

We are looking to make this a regular occurrence which will benefit all agencies. Recruitment was also a priority for the agencies and we are keen to encourage new, keen local individuals to become part of our emergency services family. We look forward to hearing from interested members of the public who may become valuable members of the emergency services in the future.”\nAs far as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is concerned, Mr. Colliar said anyone is welcome to drop in when training is taking place at Skye fire stations.

We are not naieve to imagine that the British prime minister is in any frame of mind to listen much less to take heed to the needs of this island or the views of people here. \n\"Right across society, business, farming and community interests, north and south are dismayed at the fact that the British prime minister uses hard Brexiteer rhetoric designed for Brexiteers and the Brexiteers within the DUP. \n\n\"We need to reiterate again that Ireland will not be the collateral damage to the Tory Brexit, that there will be no hardening of the border on the island of Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct,\" she added. \nMary Lou McDonald also called on Irish government and the EU need to challenge the British government on its rhetoric and to fulfil the commitments it has already entered into. \n\"You cannot say there will be no hard border and then propose a course of action that will deliver a hard border. That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2705f.jpg","title":"65149  ","story":"    \nJUST one week after finishing his GCSEs, 16-year-old Gerard McLean put himself to the test once again. \nThe talented teenager, a member of Antrim Karate Club for the last seven years, headed off with the Northern Ireland Karate team to the European Open Championships in Resita, Romania.\nAnd the long journey proved to be a very successful one, with Gerard winning silver medals in both individual and team kumite (fighting) events.\nClearly a star in the making, the local lad has achieved a lot in the sport already - but pundits agree that the very best is yet to come.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2704f.jpg","title":"65150  ","story":"    \nAN Antrim hockey player will be gunning for World Cup glory with Ireland later this month.\nZoe Wilson has been included in the 18-player Irish squad for the tournament, which is being held this year in London.\nThe former Randalstown player and Ballyclare High pupil made her Irish senior debut in Spain in January 2016 and has already amassed 70 caps.\nShe had spent the previous season with Syracuse University where she won an NCAA Championship. \nOn her return, the 21-year-old spent a year playing professionally in Germany with before signing for Belfast Harlequins to play in the EYL.\u0026#160 \nZoe said: I am absolutely delighted and honoured to have the opportunity to play against the best players in the world at such a prestigious competition.\nIreland play in a tough pool with\u0026#160 games against USA, India and reigning Olympic champions, England.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a2701f.jpg","title":"65153  ","story":"    \nPRESSURE is mounting on disgraced former SDLP councillor Brian Duffin to walk away from political life after he became embroiled in a sex scandal.\nThe 73-year-old was found guilty last month of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl.
