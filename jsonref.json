Rusty said Angel saw the post and said: \u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027           In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Rusty Updegraff claims the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would leave town for ten days at a time and not call her children. He says seeing the emotional impact her behavior was having on Angel and even Phoenix, 19, spurred him to actJudge Mark Juhas imposed the strict regulations while he works out what to do over long term custody with her ex Belafonte.The order says Mel can, \u0027hire an acceptable nanny from a registered and bonded agency\u0027 to satisfy the requirement, but there must be someone \u0027present\u0027 so that the star is not left alone with her child unsupervised.Restaurateur Rusty says he is pleased with the outcome and it was never his intention to push for Mel to lose custody of her children.\u0027I did the job, you know, because it\u0027s about the kids, not about her,\u0027 he said.\u0027Those girls love their mom and Melanie loves the girls, but Melanie desperately needs help.\u0027I want her to be clean and healthy, because when she\u0027s healthy she can be a mom again. Right now she\u0027s the world\u0027s worst mom.\u0027Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.And during the shouting matches the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would often hit out at sports mad Angel calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant.He recalls: \u0027Angel\u0027s a tomboy, she doesn\u0027t like to shower, she\u0027s at that age, so Mel nicknames her smelly b***h, she\u0027s like, \u0027you want to be a smelly b***h? Everybody will call you smelly b***h\u0027 and she\u0027d just keep going.\u0027I pleaded with her, \u0027\u0027please don\u0027t say that to your daughter\u0027\u0027. She responded: \u0027\u0027Why? She is a smelly b***h… she stinks.\u0027\u0027\u0027Angel is 11 years old, that\u0027s going to stay with her, I know because my dad was like that...it just creates these insecurities in children as they get older.\u0027    Rusty claims that the singer cruelly bullied her 11-year-old daughter Angel (pictured together), calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant          Updegraff filed the bombshell deposition in regards to the America\u0027s Got Talent judge after witnessing her behavior while he was looking after her young children for nine months          Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot. Pictured: Mel B with Angel (left), Madison (center) and Phoenix, 19, (right) on Mother\u0027s Day           Updegraff shared texts messages he received from Mel B\u0027s best friend Charlotte, who tried to stage an intervention with the singer, which lists her numerous partners          The screenshots Updegraff provided also reveal an enormous tower of tequila boxes stockpiled in Mel B\u0027s homeOn another occasion one of the star\u0027s Instagram posts got the attention of Angel.Mel posed naked with hairdresser and BFF Gary Madatyan, who was also naked, in a swimming pool and posted the provocative photos on her social media feed.Rusty, 60, recalls the shocking moment Mel\u0027s daughter spotted the post.\u0027We were in Palm Springs and Mel had been drinking. I was on my last nerve and Mel had been on a roll in LA before she even went to Palm Springs.\u0027Then Angel saw an Instagram post of Melanie naked with Gary her hairdresser and she\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027\u0027\u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad.\u0027Angel was embarrassed that Mommy had done this. Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children          Last month when Mel revealed she was heading for rehab for PTSD, she admitted she was struggling to deal with her emotions - which lead her to seek solace in booze and sex.

The company has come under harsh criticism for its response to the disaster on Thursday Columbia Gas was due to start replacing its network of old pipes on Monday. It announced plans for the improved works on Thursday morning and said the network was \u0027ready to be retired\u0027. It\u0027s unclear as of yet whether the over-pressurized gas main, which has been informally blamed for the explosions, was one of the sets of pipes it needed to replace. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the company said: \u0027What happened in the Merrimack Valley yesterday was a tragic incident. \u0027We are saddened to learn of the death of a young man as a result of these events. Our thoughts and continued support are with those who have been injured and affected.\u0027           Massachusetts Gov Charlie Baker and Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera were both critical of Columbia Gas\u0027 response to the emergencyIt said its focus was on \u0027providing as much support as possible\u0027 but it offered no apology nor did it take any responsibility for the explosions. The company did not respond to DailyMail.com\u0027s inquiries about the disaster on Friday morning.            Another home in Lawrence, is shown on Friday, the day after the sequence of explosions. Officials are yet to confirm it but they believe the cause was an over-pressurized gas main           The top floor windows of a property in Lawrence were all blown out as a result of the explosions. The gas company whose pipes were the ones which blew were due to replace them over the next few weeks          Part of a home which was affected in Lawrence is shown on Friday. Residents were out walking the streets despite warnings about staying away from the areaSenator Ed Markey tweeted on Friday: \u0027Shortly before 5pm yesterday, gas explosions ripped across Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover, setting dozens of homes ablaze, injuring more than 20, and killing one.           Senator Ed Markey labeled the gas company\u0027s response to the disaster \u0027totally unacceptable\u0027 on Friday. Columbia Gas has not replied to DailyMail.com\u0027s inquiries \u0027Columbia Gas didn\u0027t post its first update until after 9pm, 4+ hours after the disaster. Totally unacceptable.\u0027  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed, 12 people were injured and 18-year-old Leonel Rondon was killed.According to the state fire marshal, which is still investigating the cause of the accident, it is likely that an over pressurized gas main is what caused it.It is not known if Columbia Gas was planning to replace it as part of its improvement works.In its announcement of the project on Thursday, the company said: \u0027As with many other types of infrastructure, like roads, dams, and bridges, deterioration occurs over time and repairs or replacement are eventually needed.\u0027The old gas pipes installed in your neighborhood generations ago served us well, but they are now ready to be retired.\u0027If we do nothing, the cost to maintain and repair these older pipes will be higher than the cost to replace them.           A home in North Andover, another town which saw explosions, is pictured on Friday, the day after the explosions           A house in Lawrence was taped off by police on Friday. Many residents were forced to leave as a safety precaution regardless of whether their home had been blown up \u0027That is why we are taking proactive steps today, reducing costs to our customers.\u0027 For the people driven out of their homes by the fires, it will be a long time before they can return to normal life, let alone their properties. On Friday, schools in the area remain closed. The explosions caused 18,000 people across the city to lose power.  Rondon was killed by flying debris which hit the car he was traveling in with two friends. He was out celebrating getting his driver\u0027s license at the time. Gov. Charlie Baker said on Thursday night that state and local authorities are investigating but that it could take days or weeks before they turn up answers.

But not any more.Now, one of the country’s top psychologists and behavioural geneticists, Professor Robert Plomin, of King’s College London, offers an emphatic conclusion.It is drawn from 45 years of research and hundreds of studies. He says the single most important factor in each and every one of us — the very essence of our iniduality — is our genetic make-up, our DNA.The basic building blocks of life that we inherit from our parents are what determine who we are — not how much they loved us, read us books or which school they sent us to.DNA accounts for at least half the variance in people’s psychological traits, much more than any other single factor. Put simply, ‘nature’ trumps ‘nurture’ every time, and not just marginally, but by a long, long chalk.Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits — from how tall we are to how much we weigh — but also to our intelligence and our psychology, from a tendency to depression to having resilience and grit.          Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits but also to our psychologyPlomin’s revolutionary conclusion — outlined in a challenging and thought-provoking new book, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are — is a game-changer, he claims, with far-reaching implications for psychology and for society.He turns much conventional thinking on its head, controversially calling into question many basic assumptions, such as the value of formal education to change people’s lives.It also undermines the parenting advice industry, the basis of all those groaning shelves of manuals telling us the right way to bring up our children and the disasters that will ensue if we get it wrong.These sell because every parent wants to think they can make a difference to their child, that they can help him or her with reading and arithmetic or teach them how to be kind or conscientious. But, says Plomin, there’s no hard evidence that this is true.On the contrary, our ability to read, to learn, to empathise and so on are all ruled primarily by our genes.Kate\u0027s mission to rescue kids at risk: Duchess of Cambridge...She\u0027s been criticised for taking a stance. But in a personal...Share this articleBeing a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNA.The raw material of our natural selves is what overwhelmingly determines what we can — and cannot — achieve, not how we are brought up. And all those parenting books that promise to deliver developmental outcomes for children are, he maintains, merely ‘peddling snake oil’.If Plomin is right — and he offers an impressive array of research over many years — then dear old Philip Larkin was a grumpy old man not because of his upbringing, but because that tendency was in the genetic blueprint he was born with. The good news, of course, is that his huge talent came from the same source.Chicago-born Plomin’s startling conclusions come from two of his long-term studies. Over the course of 40 years, he tracked 250 adopted children in Colorado along with the birth parents who gave them their genes, and the adoptive parents who raised them. After moving to London in 1994, he launched a 20-year study of more than 12,000 pairs of twins.From these studies, it was possible to unravel the relative importance of genes as opposed to environment when it came to their development.          Being a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNAMillions of pieces of data were amassed from the parents, teachers and the children themselves, about psychological traits such as hyperactivity and inattention, talents such as school achievement and the ability to learn languages, and physical characteristics, such as the propensity to put on weight and become obese.From all this, he found overwhelming evidence that adopted children are similar to their birth parents, not the parents who raised them. Identical twins (ie, from a single egg and therefore with the same DNA) develop much more similarly to each other as compared with non-identical twins (from separate eggs and with different DNA).The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn out.Even stressful life events such as relationship break-ups, financial difficulties and illness don’t have the impact that people generally assume.          The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn outIn fact, what really matters in such situations is our genes, because it is our genes that determine how well or badly an inidual deals with such setbacks. And whether we’re resilient to life’s catastrophes or cave in is determined by our DNA, too.Take orce. Even though the children in a family are all affected, how each inidual deals with it often differs. It is often harder on one sibling than the other(s) — and that difference is because of their different DNA.In fact, Plomin argues, there are genetic influences in virtually everything we do. Those differences determine how we perceive and interpret the world we grow up in, and how we modify our behaviour accordingly.In school, genetic differences in children’s aptitudes and interests, inherited from their parents, affect the extent to which they take advantage of educational opportunities. Similarly, genetic differences in our vulnerability to depression affect the extent to which we interpret experiences we undergo positively or negatively.          Parents, Plomin insists, need to realise ‘that they are not carpenters building a child from scratch‘We can try to force our dreams on them, that they become, for example, a world-class pianist or a star athlete. But we are unlikely to be successful unless we go with the genetic grain.’That, though, still leaves an important role for parents — to find out what their children do well and provide the opportunities for them to do it. What we should not do is try to change them into something they are not.‘Each child is their own person genetically. We need to recognise and respect their genetic differences. If we go against the grain, we run the risk of damaging our relationship with them.’This has positives for parents, too, relieving them of the anxiety and guilt piled on them in how-to parenting manuals.‘These can scare us into thinking that one wrong move can ruin a child for ever.’Plomin hopes his findings will ‘free parents from the illusion that a child’s future success depends on how hard they push them’.And the same, he insists, goes for schools — a theory that challenges the principles on which our education system is based.Schools, he says, matter in that they teach basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. They also dispense fundamental information about history, science, maths and culture. But choice of school makes very little difference to a child’s achievement.‘Genetics is by far the major source of inidual differences in school achievement.’This suggests we should ignore all those league tables of exam results and Ofsted ratings. Plomin argues that differences in schools have very little effect on outcome.This conclusion will inevitably trigger a great debate about the comparative merits of selective grammar schools and non-selective comprehensives.On average, GCSE scores for children in selective schools are a grade higher than in non-selective schools, and this difference is usually assumed to be because selective schools provide better schooling. Genetic research, however, shows that if the best pupils are selected according to the abilities they showed at primary school, they’ll inevitably get better GCSE results.This is because of who they are, not what they’ve learned in the classroom or the way they’ve been taught.Those higher grades are simply a self-fulfilling prophecy.Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16.The ‘value added’ — a measure used by many top schools — turns out to be very small.          The influence of our DNA is not completely confined to our early years when we’re growing upThe same principle applies in the debate about private and state schools. If, as Plomin claims, schools have little effect on inidual differences in achievement, then those 7 per cent of parents who pay huge sums to send their children to private schools in the belief that it will give them an advantage may well be wasting their cash.Plomin writes: ‘Expensive schooling cannot survive a cost–benefit analysis on the basis of school achievement itself.’If your genes fit, you’ll do well and, if they don’t, no amount of cash can change the abilities you’re born with.What all schools should aspire to, he maintains, is to be places where children can learn to enjoy learning for its own sake, rather than frenetically teaching pupils to pass the exams that will improve the school’s standing in league tables.Not that the influence of our DNA is confined to our early years when we’re growing up.Indeed, Plomin shows that it gets stronger as we get older. More and more, we revert to type. Yes, other factors impact on us, such as our relationships with partners, children and friends, our jobs and interests. All contribute to give life meaning.But they don’t fundamentally change who we are psychologically — our personality, our mental health and our cognitive abilities. Good and bad things happen to us, but eventually we rebound to our genetic trajectory. Many people, Plomin acknowledges, will be aghast at his ‘bold conclusion’.It seems to make us automatons, devoid of free will, victims of our DNA. And, indeed, this level of determinism could be an excuse for apathy, a refusal to take responsibility for oneself: ‘Not my fault, guv, it’s my genes!’However, he categorically rejects this notion.Just because you have a genetic propensity to put on weight, for example, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try to lose some pounds.You may have the devil inside you, but you can keep it at bay.Plomin found that his own genetic mapping threw up a surprise.‘I am genetically predisposed to put on the pounds and find it hard to lose them.‘It means I can’t let my guard down and, in those weak moments, give in to those siren snacks in the cupboard whispering to me.’          Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking Plomin said there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16The same applies to anyone with a genetic propensity to depression, learning disabilities or alcohol abuse.‘Genes are not destiny,’ says Plomin. You don’t have to succumb.Controversially, he can see a time soon when DNA information will routinely be on people’s medical records, though he acknowledges that this poses serious dilemmas.Do you want to know if your child has a high genetic risk for schizophrenia when there’s nothing you can do to stop it? On the other hand, he says, many psychological disorders, such as alcohol dependence and anorexia, are difficult to cure.Early warning is good, and preventing problems before they occur is much more cost effective, economically as well as psychologically.It’s also good, he argues, that we can know our limits — those things that our DNA just won’t let happen, however hard we try.Plomin quotes with approval the observation of American comedian W.C. Fields: ‘If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. There’s no use being a damn fool about it.’Because, ultimately, it’s more sensible to go with the genetic flow rather than trying to swim upstream.Equally, our DNA can tell us where our inborn talents lie, so that we do not waste them.There was a telling example this week when former England captain Alastair Cook retired from Test cricket. In tribute, commentator Mike Atherton declared: ‘He made himself the best player he could be he extracted every last ounce of his talent.’Plomin’s radical new world may force us to bow to our genetic limits but, on the plus side, it will encourage us, like Alastair Cook, to do the best we can with the talents we’ve been given.Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are by Robert Plomin will be published by Allen Lane on October 4 at £20. © Robert Plomin 2018.

It’s so sad, because he’s missing out on so much.’Part of the problem is, I believe, that even in the 21st century the image of retirement remains firmly stuck in the past. It feels out of sync in a world that places such a high premium on being purposeful and busy — and where being stressed out is not only the norm, but a marker of success.‘We have become so obsessed over the past few decades with working hard and the idea of being a “go-getter” that retirement — because it’s the antithesis of that — is seen as giving up,’ says Ian Stuart-Hamilton, professor of developmental psychology at the University of South Wales.‘There are more than enough role models now of people who are ploughing on long past retirement age, like the U.S. business magnate Warren Buffett, who’s 88.‘The danger is that once you get trapped into that mindset, retirement then seems like a kind of failure.’So what can we do to change that mindset? Today and next week I will explore how we can, with careful planning and honesty about our long-term goals, turn the potential negatives of retirement into positives.I will look at the thorny issues that trouble those about to retire: how and when to take that all-important step reinventing ourselves for the next phase keeping physically and mentally alert and, yes, rekindling our marriages, too.WINDING DOWN OR A LEAP IN THE DARK?TIME was when the decision about how and when to stop work was easy. The retirement age was fixed at 65 for men and 60 for women, and those milestones remained comfortably in the back of your mind for the whole of your working life.But with a change in the law in 2011 abolishing the default retirement age, the certainties have been swept away.In theory, we can all carry on till we drop. Indeed, the numbers choosing to work on after 65 have doubled to a record 1.19 million over the past ten years.So of all the numerous retirement options that now confront us, which one is best?Phased in: reducing your hours gradually by working part- time before leaving? Cliff-edge: stopping work overnight? Portfolio: a mixture of part-time, consultancy, self-employment andor voluntary work?The list goes on. Should I defer my pension? Should I take it as a lump sum, or as an annuity, or drawdown?Retirement has gone from being a single, easy-to-grasp concept to a mind-boggling mixed bag of possibilities.          So why is it that so many people find retirement unbelievably tough?On the face of it, stopping work overnight sounds like a seriously bad idea. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s true that many retirements get off to a bad start when the change is too sudden. Yet the surprising truth is that for others, it works very well.‘You remember that wonderful feeling when you were a child and the summer holidays seemed to stretch in front of you endlessly?’ says Lily, who took early retirement from the Department for Work and Pensions in Sheffield. ‘That’s how I felt the day after I left work.‘It was as though I’d been given a gift. To begin with it felt like annual leave. But after a few weeks came the realisation that I didn’t have to go back. It was wonderful.’The key to making cliff-edge retirement work is preparation, says Chris Phillipson, professor of sociology and social gerontology at Manchester University.‘The assumption that cliff-edge is bad is just that — an assumption,’ he says. ‘It may not be bad if you’re supported, or it may well be very bad if there is no support.’For others, the idea of weaning yourself off work gradually over a period of months or years is more appealing. There are two ways to do this: either by negotiating phased retirement with your employer, or by leaving your full‑time job and finding new part-time work or self-employment.‘On the whole, it’s been very good,’ says Irene, an administrative assistant who has reduced her days in preparation for her retirement. ‘If I had retired suddenly, it wouldn’t have given me a chance to see what I’m going to do with my time.\u0027I hope he burns in hell!\u0027: Jessica Chambers\u0027 mom visits...Hiic Taco Bell employee is FIRED after she refused to...Share this article‘It’s taken me a while to find new clubs and classes I really like and activities I want to do. Now I’m in the swing of it, I’m really looking forward to retiring.‘Also, if I’d gone for cliff-edge retirement, the money would have been cut off straight away. As it is, I’ve gradually got used to not spending so much.’But phased retirement is not without its flaws. For some people, it turns out to be an unsatisfactory limbo where they end up with a foot in both camps, and not enough time or energy to give their full attention to either.‘It can be difficult because your position in the workplace is immediately changed,’ says Professor Phillipson. ‘You’re half in and half out.‘Some people are comfortable with the changed relationship they have with colleagues, but some aren’t. If that’s the case, they are dragging out a change they might be best doing straight away.’What’s increasingly popular is a mixture of part-time work, paid or unpaid consultancy and volunteering — which hopefully leaves time to have fun, too.With this option there’s a flexibility that allows people to shift the balance between their different activities as their priorities change. Reducing your workload in your main career is a good way of moving into a mixed portfolio.          Look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up childrenSpecific ideas are more useful than vague ambitions. Where will you spend most of your time? What will you be doing? With which friends do you want to socialise? How will weekends differ from weekdays?If you plan to volunteer, work part-time or set up your own business, find out what skills or qualifications you might need.Finally, look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up children. Now is the time to revive them.MANAGE THE TRANSITIONTHE latest research suggests that the best way to cope with retirement is to treat it not as the end of the road, but as a major life transition, on a par with leaving home or facing up to an empty nest.And the good news is that by this stage in their lives, people have what it takes to cope successfully, according to psychology lecturer Dr Oliver Robinson.‘We can learn a lot from previous transitions,’ he says. ‘Many of the same issues come up in major life crises, such as identity, meaning, purpose. If you navigate through a crisis successfully and grow out of it, it should mean you’re well prepared for the next one.’Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, agrees. ‘Retirement can be a dirty word, because people see it as the end a phase where you do nothing,’ she says. ‘If you change jobs, you go from Job A to Job B. But retirement has no B attached. The antidote is to see retirement as a change, rather than a movement towards nothing.’This new and illuminating approach focuses on how the psychological qualities we have developed during previous transitions and throughout our working lives — attributes such as resilience, adaptability, flexibility, open-mindedness and a ‘can-do’ attitude — can stand us in good stead for the challenges of retirement.John, who took two extended breaks from work to go travelling, first in his 30s and then in his 50s, when he went to Barcelona for a few months to learn Spanish and ended up staying away for seven years, is a case in point.‘I think both experiences helped me when it came to preparing for retirement,’ he says. ‘You realise that you have to make things happen. You can’t be passive.’He is so right. It’s true that the happiest retired people are often the ones who are most proactive about looking for interesting stuff to do. If there’s no birdwatching or film club in their area, they don’t hang around they set one up.When one friend of mine retired to the countryside, she really missed her book group. So she bravely went up to anyone she liked the look of and asked if they would like to join hers.If you’re lucky enough to come across someone like this, see them as the true asset they are.IT’S TIME TO CREATE A NEW YOURETIRING involves one of the biggest shifts of identity we ever go through — as momentous as becoming a parent or leaving home. After years of being seen, and of seeing yourself, as a shopkeeper or a nurse or an engineer, you suddenly become an ex-whatever it was. It’s common to feel, as Nadia does, ‘that you’re 60 and you’re just not in the world any more. You don’t matter.’For her, the loss of status she feels is acute.‘I don’t like being invisible when I walk into a room,’ says Nadia. ‘At work you have a formal place to assert yourself. You get paid.          Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you‘Then all that structure is shipped away and you’re left just sort of flapping around, saying: “I used to be a . . .”‘Everything you’ve built up throughout your career disappears, and suddenly you’re just another old lady looking to do a bit of volunteering.’For women in particular, work bestows an independent identity quite separate from home and family life. When that disappears — and it often coincides with losing the hands-on parenting role — it can leave people feeling doubly discombobulated.It may be that you don’t even want to think about a new identity before you retire. But if you are aware that work dominates your life (or your partner’s) to the exclusion of other interests, it’s worth starting to develop at least one new activity beforehand.Supportive networks that run parallel to work and that will continue beyond it can be a huge help.People will start to see you not just as a brilliant brain surgeon, but as a wicked darts player or a fine guitarist.Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you.It’s also important to reinforce this new identity with other people. Rather than apologetically saying: ‘I used to be a . . .’ when asked what you do, it feels much more positive to say: ‘I’m studying astronomy,’ or ‘I’m planning to start a rag-rugging business.’Soon, other people in your immediate circle and beyond will get used to seeing you in a new light, and that, in turn, reinforces your own new view of yourself.Liz, who retired two years ago, got round the problem by telling people she was taking ‘a pause’, rather than that she had finished work. ‘If you tell people you’re retired, their eyes glaze over a bit — especially younger people,’ she says. ‘I didn’t enjoy the glazing.‘However, when I started exploring a new part of myself and tried out different things I really enjoyed, I became comfortable with the idea of a different identity. Now I’m happy to say I’m retired.’It’s a process that happens organically, but sometimes it needs a bit of a push.As your work persona gradually recedes, it leaves space for a different side of life to take centre stage, and you can spend more time on activities that resonate with your core values.

They may yet succeed. But I am beginning to doubt it.Indeed, I believe that Mrs May could be on the verge of securing the greatest triumph of her political career.Although cynics predict that her visit to Salzburg on Wednesday will end in tears, I have spoken to well-informed sources close to the British and European sides of the Brexit negotiating teams and detect signs of a breakthrough. There\u0027s a mood of optimism — of friendship even.Revealed: The election speech Theresa May wanted to deliver...Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleThere\u0027s a quiet, but growing, belief that the British Prime Minister is close to striking a remarkable deal. Of course, that won\u0027t happen in Salzburg. There could well be a confected row between the 27 other EU leaders and Mrs May. That would be designed to give the impression that Brussels won\u0027t be a pushover on Brexit.However, no one can deny that the rudiments for a deal exist. And it\u0027s one that would enable Britain to leave the EU on reasonable terms.Let me explain how this has been achieved. Until recent weeks, our negotiators have been struggling against a Brussels bureaucracy fronted by intransigent chief negotiator Michel Barnier, supported by the clapped-out Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.          Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May welcomes Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, to 10 Downing Street in London in June 25, 2018Confronting them has been like negotiating with a wall of flint.No wonder talks repeatedly foundered.It didn\u0027t help that Barnier\u0027s relationship with David Davis, before he stood down as Brexit Secretary, was toxic.For her part, Mrs May should be able to bypass the wretched Barnier and Juncker. She will deal directly with French leader Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Both of them are realists. Not only are they aware that it\u0027s in their countries\u0027 best interests not to treat Britain badly, but that Mrs May deserves decent terms for us departing the EU.Merkel has been told forcefully by Germany\u0027s manufacturers that it is vital for them not to face unnecessary hurdles selling products to their biggest market — Britain. If that means, for example, importing British-made Range Rovers and Nissans freely in exchange for exporting their own BMWs and Mercedes, so be it.Of course Mrs May will come under intense pressure to water down her so-called Chequers proposals. EU negotiators will endeavour to force Britain to keep access to European markets on condition that we sign up to European single market rules and regulations. Britain will also be told to keep paying tens of billions of pounds into EU coffers.But as far as Mrs May is concerned, some of these concessions would be worth it rather than risk Britain exiting with no deal.A successful outcome would be an unmitigated triumph for our embattled Prime Minister.It would also prove wrong all those who have likened her Chequers strategy to a dodo.Barnier, Juncker, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Blair, Vince Cable and her detractors in the media would all have to eat humble pie.          European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, (middle right) embraces British Prime Minister Theresa May (middle left) after a meeting at EU headquarters in Brussels Oct 16, 2017Some, such as the most dyspeptic hard-line Tory Brexiteers, would, of course, refuse. They would unsheath daggers at next month\u0027s Conservative Party conference and hurl shouts of \u0027betrayal\u0027.But the truth is that such a Brexit deal with the EU would honour Mrs May\u0027s promise to the British people that Brexit would mean a free trade area for goods no more free movement of people across our border leaving the Common Agricultural Policy taking back control of UK waters by quitting the Common Fisheries Policy supremacy for UK courts and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice.This weekend, the Tory Brexit rebels are gravely weakened. The first sign of this emerged when their European Research Group (ERG) faction failed to put forward cogent proposals for how Britain would survive outside the EU if Mrs May\u0027s Chequers deal collapsed. Also, all the foment about a leadership challenge to Mrs May proved to be nothing but a mirage.Furthermore, awkward questions are being asked about the funding of the ERG, with a possible investigation by parliamentary watchdogs into a secret bank account used to pay for wining and dining supporters.While these high-stakes politics are being played out, it is vital to remember that the referendum ballot paper in June 2016 asked voters to make a simple choice: whether they wanted to remain in, or leave, the European Union.There were no stated terms on which Britain might leave.Considering the way politics has descended into the gutter during the 27 months since then, Theresa May has climbed bravely to near the pinnacle of the mountain.How apposite that, next week, it will be beside the majestic Alps, in Salzburg, that she might start to believe that an honourable Brexit is finally within reach.  Cook\u0027s first-class retirement           Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket after playing for more than a decade at the top of his professionEvery leading politician should learn from the dignified way that Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket.After playing for more than a decade at the top of his profession, he will continue to turn out for his Essex county team for another three years.What a contrast with both Tony Blair and David Cameron, who abruptly abandoned the House of Commons after standing down as prime minister.This point was well made by Labour MP Chris Bryant, who said that the two men should have remained in front-line politics to offer the benefit of their years of experience.In previous ages, ex-prime ministers often stayed on as MPs. A notable example was first-class cricketer Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served as foreign secretary in the Heath government for four years after he lost the 1964 General Election as PM.Intriguingly it was Sir Alec who once famously said, years before Britain joined what was then the Common Market, that the embryonic union of European countries was \u0027a dead duck that could not quack\u0027!  Despite their shrill accusations about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, the Tories have a serious anti-Semitism problem of their own.This was disgracefully demonstrated by Conservative MEPs\u0027 support for the hard-Right Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, who has waged a long, vicious vendetta against the Jewish philanthropist George Soros, accusing him of plotting to take control of the country.Orban has made inflammatory comments about Muslims and hailed a Hungarian leader who collaborated with the Nazis during the Holocaust as \u0027an outstanding statesman\u0027.This week, Conservative MEPs opposed a motion in the European Parliament which condemned Orban for attacking minorities and suppressing free speech and press freedom. They were the only governing party in Western Europe to do so.Although Theresa May\u0027s spokesman dissociated her from her colleagues\u0027 vote, I cannot believe that Tory MEPs would have acted in this way without covert approval from No 10.If this is the case, it is a most misguided policy. For at a time when Brexit talks are in the balance, Mrs May needs every morsel of support from fellow European leaders, and must not offend them by linking Britain with the odious Orban. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/14/19DD622C00000514-0-image-m-19_1536930123649.jpg","title":"British intelligence chiefs thought former Labour leader Michael Foot paid Soviet informant","story":"    Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg GordievskyMI6 believed claims made by a Soviet defector that former Labour leader Michael Foot was a paid KGB contact, according to a new book.Intelligence chiefs were reportedly briefed on the politician’s KGB history in 1982 and were prepared to pass on the information to the Queen had he become prime minister after the following year’s general election.Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg Gordievsky, were first published in the Sunday Times 23 years ago. At the time he dismissed the claims as a ‘big lie’ and successfully sued the paper for libel.But documents, published in The Spy and the Traitor, show that MI6 thought the evidence presented by Mr Gordievsky was strong enough to pass on to the Queen.In a 1982 debriefing, the former agent allegedly said the KGB had paid Mr Foot the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money, according to the new book.Even though he was supposedly paid by the Soviets, Mr Gordievsky said that the politician was not a ‘spy or conscious agent’.Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleInstead he was allegedly a contact who was paid for ‘disinformation purposes’, meaning he might have been fed false information.Mr Foot lost the 1983 election to Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Party, helped in large part by Britain’s victory in the Falklands War.Author Ben Macintyre wrote: ‘Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election. It was agreed that should a politician with a KGB history become prime minister of Britain, then the Queen would have to be informed.’           The double agent (pictured) said that the Labour leader was an informant for the KGB  MI6 chiefs were so concerned about Michael Foot\u0027s (pictured, right) alleged links to the KGB that they were prepared to pass information onto the Queen  (pictured, left, in 1982) The journalist also revealed that the information was ‘too politically incendiary’ to show to Margaret Thatcher.The allegations made against Mr Foot were detailed in a 400-page file labelled ‘Agent Boot’.The word ‘agent’ is believed to have been later crossed out when Mr Foot was demoted to a ‘confidential contact’. The file claims Mr Foot was first contacted by Soviet intelligence while working at the left-wing magazine Tribune in the 1940s.Mr Gordievsky also made claims about how the Soviet secret services had infiltrated other factions of the Labour Party, which had become increasingly left-wing in the early 1980s.The party’s 1983 election manifesto, which outlined several socialist policies, was later dubbed ‘the longest suicide note in history’ by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Mr Foot resigned following the election defeat and three years as Labour leader. He died in 2010 aged 96.Trade union leader Jack Jones was also listed as an ‘agent’ by Mr Gordievsky. The spy claimed he met Mr Jones for lunch, but found him ‘absolutely useless’ as a contact.Mr Gordievsky became a double-agent for MI6 in the 1970s, later rising to be head of the KGB’s London station in the early 1980s. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/12/4EBC9D5E00000578-0-image-a-14_1533121538202.jpg","title":"New eSports degree university students play computer games coursework","story":"    Students at the University of Chichester will pay total fees of £27,750 before living costs  be required to play FIFA, Counter- Strike, League of Legends and Project Cars as part of the degree.

A home that, she says, holds so many happy memories.Josie today is a successful textile artist and she’s turned her old bedroom into a studio. She refuses to dwell on the horrific events that would seem utterly insurmountable to most of us: ‘I don’t remember very much, she said. ‘We just carried on with life.

But not any more.Now, one of the country’s top psychologists and behavioural geneticists, Professor Robert Plomin, of King’s College London, offers an emphatic conclusion.It is drawn from 45 years of research and hundreds of studies. He says the single most important factor in each and every one of us — the very essence of our iniduality — is our genetic make-up, our DNA.The basic building blocks of life that we inherit from our parents are what determine who we are — not how much they loved us, read us books or which school they sent us to.DNA accounts for at least half the variance in people’s psychological traits, much more than any other single factor. Put simply, ‘nature’ trumps ‘nurture’ every time, and not just marginally, but by a long, long chalk.Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits — from how tall we are to how much we weigh — but also to our intelligence and our psychology, from a tendency to depression to having resilience and grit.          Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits but also to our psychologyPlomin’s revolutionary conclusion — outlined in a challenging and thought-provoking new book, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are — is a game-changer, he claims, with far-reaching implications for psychology and for society.He turns much conventional thinking on its head, controversially calling into question many basic assumptions, such as the value of formal education to change people’s lives.It also undermines the parenting advice industry, the basis of all those groaning shelves of manuals telling us the right way to bring up our children and the disasters that will ensue if we get it wrong.These sell because every parent wants to think they can make a difference to their child, that they can help him or her with reading and arithmetic or teach them how to be kind or conscientious. But, says Plomin, there’s no hard evidence that this is true.On the contrary, our ability to read, to learn, to empathise and so on are all ruled primarily by our genes.Kate\u0027s mission to rescue kids at risk: Duchess of Cambridge...She\u0027s been criticised for taking a stance. But in a personal...Share this articleBeing a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNA.The raw material of our natural selves is what overwhelmingly determines what we can — and cannot — achieve, not how we are brought up. And all those parenting books that promise to deliver developmental outcomes for children are, he maintains, merely ‘peddling snake oil’.If Plomin is right — and he offers an impressive array of research over many years — then dear old Philip Larkin was a grumpy old man not because of his upbringing, but because that tendency was in the genetic blueprint he was born with. The good news, of course, is that his huge talent came from the same source.Chicago-born Plomin’s startling conclusions come from two of his long-term studies. Over the course of 40 years, he tracked 250 adopted children in Colorado along with the birth parents who gave them their genes, and the adoptive parents who raised them. After moving to London in 1994, he launched a 20-year study of more than 12,000 pairs of twins.From these studies, it was possible to unravel the relative importance of genes as opposed to environment when it came to their development.          Being a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNAMillions of pieces of data were amassed from the parents, teachers and the children themselves, about psychological traits such as hyperactivity and inattention, talents such as school achievement and the ability to learn languages, and physical characteristics, such as the propensity to put on weight and become obese.From all this, he found overwhelming evidence that adopted children are similar to their birth parents, not the parents who raised them. Identical twins (ie, from a single egg and therefore with the same DNA) develop much more similarly to each other as compared with non-identical twins (from separate eggs and with different DNA).The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn out.Even stressful life events such as relationship break-ups, financial difficulties and illness don’t have the impact that people generally assume.          The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn outIn fact, what really matters in such situations is our genes, because it is our genes that determine how well or badly an inidual deals with such setbacks. And whether we’re resilient to life’s catastrophes or cave in is determined by our DNA, too.Take orce. Even though the children in a family are all affected, how each inidual deals with it often differs. It is often harder on one sibling than the other(s) — and that difference is because of their different DNA.In fact, Plomin argues, there are genetic influences in virtually everything we do. Those differences determine how we perceive and interpret the world we grow up in, and how we modify our behaviour accordingly.In school, genetic differences in children’s aptitudes and interests, inherited from their parents, affect the extent to which they take advantage of educational opportunities. Similarly, genetic differences in our vulnerability to depression affect the extent to which we interpret experiences we undergo positively or negatively.          Parents, Plomin insists, need to realise ‘that they are not carpenters building a child from scratch‘We can try to force our dreams on them, that they become, for example, a world-class pianist or a star athlete. But we are unlikely to be successful unless we go with the genetic grain.’That, though, still leaves an important role for parents — to find out what their children do well and provide the opportunities for them to do it. What we should not do is try to change them into something they are not.‘Each child is their own person genetically. We need to recognise and respect their genetic differences. If we go against the grain, we run the risk of damaging our relationship with them.’This has positives for parents, too, relieving them of the anxiety and guilt piled on them in how-to parenting manuals.‘These can scare us into thinking that one wrong move can ruin a child for ever.’Plomin hopes his findings will ‘free parents from the illusion that a child’s future success depends on how hard they push them’.And the same, he insists, goes for schools — a theory that challenges the principles on which our education system is based.Schools, he says, matter in that they teach basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. They also dispense fundamental information about history, science, maths and culture. But choice of school makes very little difference to a child’s achievement.‘Genetics is by far the major source of inidual differences in school achievement.’This suggests we should ignore all those league tables of exam results and Ofsted ratings. Plomin argues that differences in schools have very little effect on outcome.This conclusion will inevitably trigger a great debate about the comparative merits of selective grammar schools and non-selective comprehensives.On average, GCSE scores for children in selective schools are a grade higher than in non-selective schools, and this difference is usually assumed to be because selective schools provide better schooling. Genetic research, however, shows that if the best pupils are selected according to the abilities they showed at primary school, they’ll inevitably get better GCSE results.This is because of who they are, not what they’ve learned in the classroom or the way they’ve been taught.Those higher grades are simply a self-fulfilling prophecy.Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16.The ‘value added’ — a measure used by many top schools — turns out to be very small.          The influence of our DNA is not completely confined to our early years when we’re growing upThe same principle applies in the debate about private and state schools. If, as Plomin claims, schools have little effect on inidual differences in achievement, then those 7 per cent of parents who pay huge sums to send their children to private schools in the belief that it will give them an advantage may well be wasting their cash.Plomin writes: ‘Expensive schooling cannot survive a cost–benefit analysis on the basis of school achievement itself.’If your genes fit, you’ll do well and, if they don’t, no amount of cash can change the abilities you’re born with.What all schools should aspire to, he maintains, is to be places where children can learn to enjoy learning for its own sake, rather than frenetically teaching pupils to pass the exams that will improve the school’s standing in league tables.Not that the influence of our DNA is confined to our early years when we’re growing up.Indeed, Plomin shows that it gets stronger as we get older. More and more, we revert to type. Yes, other factors impact on us, such as our relationships with partners, children and friends, our jobs and interests. All contribute to give life meaning.But they don’t fundamentally change who we are psychologically — our personality, our mental health and our cognitive abilities. Good and bad things happen to us, but eventually we rebound to our genetic trajectory. Many people, Plomin acknowledges, will be aghast at his ‘bold conclusion’.It seems to make us automatons, devoid of free will, victims of our DNA. And, indeed, this level of determinism could be an excuse for apathy, a refusal to take responsibility for oneself: ‘Not my fault, guv, it’s my genes!’However, he categorically rejects this notion.Just because you have a genetic propensity to put on weight, for example, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try to lose some pounds.You may have the devil inside you, but you can keep it at bay.Plomin found that his own genetic mapping threw up a surprise.‘I am genetically predisposed to put on the pounds and find it hard to lose them.‘It means I can’t let my guard down and, in those weak moments, give in to those siren snacks in the cupboard whispering to me.’          Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking Plomin said there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16The same applies to anyone with a genetic propensity to depression, learning disabilities or alcohol abuse.‘Genes are not destiny,’ says Plomin. You don’t have to succumb.Controversially, he can see a time soon when DNA information will routinely be on people’s medical records, though he acknowledges that this poses serious dilemmas.Do you want to know if your child has a high genetic risk for schizophrenia when there’s nothing you can do to stop it? On the other hand, he says, many psychological disorders, such as alcohol dependence and anorexia, are difficult to cure.Early warning is good, and preventing problems before they occur is much more cost effective, economically as well as psychologically.It’s also good, he argues, that we can know our limits — those things that our DNA just won’t let happen, however hard we try.Plomin quotes with approval the observation of American comedian W.C. Fields: ‘If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. There’s no use being a damn fool about it.’Because, ultimately, it’s more sensible to go with the genetic flow rather than trying to swim upstream.Equally, our DNA can tell us where our inborn talents lie, so that we do not waste them.There was a telling example this week when former England captain Alastair Cook retired from Test cricket. In tribute, commentator Mike Atherton declared: ‘He made himself the best player he could be he extracted every last ounce of his talent.’Plomin’s radical new world may force us to bow to our genetic limits but, on the plus side, it will encourage us, like Alastair Cook, to do the best we can with the talents we’ve been given.Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are by Robert Plomin will be published by Allen Lane on October 4 at £20. © Robert Plomin 2018.

It’s so sad, because he’s missing out on so much.’Part of the problem is, I believe, that even in the 21st century the image of retirement remains firmly stuck in the past. It feels out of sync in a world that places such a high premium on being purposeful and busy — and where being stressed out is not only the norm, but a marker of success.‘We have become so obsessed over the past few decades with working hard and the idea of being a “go-getter” that retirement — because it’s the antithesis of that — is seen as giving up,’ says Ian Stuart-Hamilton, professor of developmental psychology at the University of South Wales.‘There are more than enough role models now of people who are ploughing on long past retirement age, like the U.S. business magnate Warren Buffett, who’s 88.‘The danger is that once you get trapped into that mindset, retirement then seems like a kind of failure.’So what can we do to change that mindset? Today and next week I will explore how we can, with careful planning and honesty about our long-term goals, turn the potential negatives of retirement into positives.I will look at the thorny issues that trouble those about to retire: how and when to take that all-important step reinventing ourselves for the next phase keeping physically and mentally alert and, yes, rekindling our marriages, too.WINDING DOWN OR A LEAP IN THE DARK?TIME was when the decision about how and when to stop work was easy. The retirement age was fixed at 65 for men and 60 for women, and those milestones remained comfortably in the back of your mind for the whole of your working life.But with a change in the law in 2011 abolishing the default retirement age, the certainties have been swept away.In theory, we can all carry on till we drop. Indeed, the numbers choosing to work on after 65 have doubled to a record 1.19 million over the past ten years.So of all the numerous retirement options that now confront us, which one is best?Phased in: reducing your hours gradually by working part- time before leaving? Cliff-edge: stopping work overnight? Portfolio: a mixture of part-time, consultancy, self-employment andor voluntary work?The list goes on. Should I defer my pension? Should I take it as a lump sum, or as an annuity, or drawdown?Retirement has gone from being a single, easy-to-grasp concept to a mind-boggling mixed bag of possibilities.          So why is it that so many people find retirement unbelievably tough?On the face of it, stopping work overnight sounds like a seriously bad idea. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s true that many retirements get off to a bad start when the change is too sudden. Yet the surprising truth is that for others, it works very well.‘You remember that wonderful feeling when you were a child and the summer holidays seemed to stretch in front of you endlessly?’ says Lily, who took early retirement from the Department for Work and Pensions in Sheffield. ‘That’s how I felt the day after I left work.‘It was as though I’d been given a gift. To begin with it felt like annual leave. But after a few weeks came the realisation that I didn’t have to go back. It was wonderful.’The key to making cliff-edge retirement work is preparation, says Chris Phillipson, professor of sociology and social gerontology at Manchester University.‘The assumption that cliff-edge is bad is just that — an assumption,’ he says. ‘It may not be bad if you’re supported, or it may well be very bad if there is no support.’For others, the idea of weaning yourself off work gradually over a period of months or years is more appealing. There are two ways to do this: either by negotiating phased retirement with your employer, or by leaving your full‑time job and finding new part-time work or self-employment.‘On the whole, it’s been very good,’ says Irene, an administrative assistant who has reduced her days in preparation for her retirement. ‘If I had retired suddenly, it wouldn’t have given me a chance to see what I’m going to do with my time.\u0027I hope he burns in hell!\u0027: Jessica Chambers\u0027 mom visits...Hiic Taco Bell employee is FIRED after she refused to...Share this article‘It’s taken me a while to find new clubs and classes I really like and activities I want to do. Now I’m in the swing of it, I’m really looking forward to retiring.‘Also, if I’d gone for cliff-edge retirement, the money would have been cut off straight away. As it is, I’ve gradually got used to not spending so much.’But phased retirement is not without its flaws. For some people, it turns out to be an unsatisfactory limbo where they end up with a foot in both camps, and not enough time or energy to give their full attention to either.‘It can be difficult because your position in the workplace is immediately changed,’ says Professor Phillipson. ‘You’re half in and half out.‘Some people are comfortable with the changed relationship they have with colleagues, but some aren’t. If that’s the case, they are dragging out a change they might be best doing straight away.’What’s increasingly popular is a mixture of part-time work, paid or unpaid consultancy and volunteering — which hopefully leaves time to have fun, too.With this option there’s a flexibility that allows people to shift the balance between their different activities as their priorities change. Reducing your workload in your main career is a good way of moving into a mixed portfolio.          Look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up childrenSpecific ideas are more useful than vague ambitions. Where will you spend most of your time? What will you be doing? With which friends do you want to socialise? How will weekends differ from weekdays?If you plan to volunteer, work part-time or set up your own business, find out what skills or qualifications you might need.Finally, look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up children. Now is the time to revive them.MANAGE THE TRANSITIONTHE latest research suggests that the best way to cope with retirement is to treat it not as the end of the road, but as a major life transition, on a par with leaving home or facing up to an empty nest.And the good news is that by this stage in their lives, people have what it takes to cope successfully, according to psychology lecturer Dr Oliver Robinson.‘We can learn a lot from previous transitions,’ he says. ‘Many of the same issues come up in major life crises, such as identity, meaning, purpose. If you navigate through a crisis successfully and grow out of it, it should mean you’re well prepared for the next one.’Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, agrees. ‘Retirement can be a dirty word, because people see it as the end a phase where you do nothing,’ she says. ‘If you change jobs, you go from Job A to Job B. But retirement has no B attached. The antidote is to see retirement as a change, rather than a movement towards nothing.’This new and illuminating approach focuses on how the psychological qualities we have developed during previous transitions and throughout our working lives — attributes such as resilience, adaptability, flexibility, open-mindedness and a ‘can-do’ attitude — can stand us in good stead for the challenges of retirement.John, who took two extended breaks from work to go travelling, first in his 30s and then in his 50s, when he went to Barcelona for a few months to learn Spanish and ended up staying away for seven years, is a case in point.‘I think both experiences helped me when it came to preparing for retirement,’ he says. ‘You realise that you have to make things happen. You can’t be passive.’He is so right. It’s true that the happiest retired people are often the ones who are most proactive about looking for interesting stuff to do. If there’s no birdwatching or film club in their area, they don’t hang around they set one up.When one friend of mine retired to the countryside, she really missed her book group. So she bravely went up to anyone she liked the look of and asked if they would like to join hers.If you’re lucky enough to come across someone like this, see them as the true asset they are.IT’S TIME TO CREATE A NEW YOURETIRING involves one of the biggest shifts of identity we ever go through — as momentous as becoming a parent or leaving home. After years of being seen, and of seeing yourself, as a shopkeeper or a nurse or an engineer, you suddenly become an ex-whatever it was. It’s common to feel, as Nadia does, ‘that you’re 60 and you’re just not in the world any more. You don’t matter.’For her, the loss of status she feels is acute.‘I don’t like being invisible when I walk into a room,’ says Nadia. ‘At work you have a formal place to assert yourself. You get paid.          Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you‘Then all that structure is shipped away and you’re left just sort of flapping around, saying: “I used to be a . . .”‘Everything you’ve built up throughout your career disappears, and suddenly you’re just another old lady looking to do a bit of volunteering.’For women in particular, work bestows an independent identity quite separate from home and family life. When that disappears — and it often coincides with losing the hands-on parenting role — it can leave people feeling doubly discombobulated.It may be that you don’t even want to think about a new identity before you retire. But if you are aware that work dominates your life (or your partner’s) to the exclusion of other interests, it’s worth starting to develop at least one new activity beforehand.Supportive networks that run parallel to work and that will continue beyond it can be a huge help.People will start to see you not just as a brilliant brain surgeon, but as a wicked darts player or a fine guitarist.Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you.It’s also important to reinforce this new identity with other people. Rather than apologetically saying: ‘I used to be a . . .’ when asked what you do, it feels much more positive to say: ‘I’m studying astronomy,’ or ‘I’m planning to start a rag-rugging business.’Soon, other people in your immediate circle and beyond will get used to seeing you in a new light, and that, in turn, reinforces your own new view of yourself.Liz, who retired two years ago, got round the problem by telling people she was taking ‘a pause’, rather than that she had finished work. ‘If you tell people you’re retired, their eyes glaze over a bit — especially younger people,’ she says. ‘I didn’t enjoy the glazing.‘However, when I started exploring a new part of myself and tried out different things I really enjoyed, I became comfortable with the idea of a different identity. Now I’m happy to say I’m retired.’It’s a process that happens organically, but sometimes it needs a bit of a push.As your work persona gradually recedes, it leaves space for a different side of life to take centre stage, and you can spend more time on activities that resonate with your core values.

They may yet succeed. But I am beginning to doubt it.Indeed, I believe that Mrs May could be on the verge of securing the greatest triumph of her political career.Although cynics predict that her visit to Salzburg on Wednesday will end in tears, I have spoken to well-informed sources close to the British and European sides of the Brexit negotiating teams and detect signs of a breakthrough. There\u0027s a mood of optimism — of friendship even.Revealed: The election speech Theresa May wanted to deliver...Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleThere\u0027s a quiet, but growing, belief that the British Prime Minister is close to striking a remarkable deal. Of course, that won\u0027t happen in Salzburg. There could well be a confected row between the 27 other EU leaders and Mrs May. That would be designed to give the impression that Brussels won\u0027t be a pushover on Brexit.However, no one can deny that the rudiments for a deal exist. And it\u0027s one that would enable Britain to leave the EU on reasonable terms.Let me explain how this has been achieved. Until recent weeks, our negotiators have been struggling against a Brussels bureaucracy fronted by intransigent chief negotiator Michel Barnier, supported by the clapped-out Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.          Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May welcomes Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, to 10 Downing Street in London in June 25, 2018Confronting them has been like negotiating with a wall of flint.No wonder talks repeatedly foundered.It didn\u0027t help that Barnier\u0027s relationship with David Davis, before he stood down as Brexit Secretary, was toxic.For her part, Mrs May should be able to bypass the wretched Barnier and Juncker. She will deal directly with French leader Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Both of them are realists. Not only are they aware that it\u0027s in their countries\u0027 best interests not to treat Britain badly, but that Mrs May deserves decent terms for us departing the EU.Merkel has been told forcefully by Germany\u0027s manufacturers that it is vital for them not to face unnecessary hurdles selling products to their biggest market — Britain. If that means, for example, importing British-made Range Rovers and Nissans freely in exchange for exporting their own BMWs and Mercedes, so be it.Of course Mrs May will come under intense pressure to water down her so-called Chequers proposals. EU negotiators will endeavour to force Britain to keep access to European markets on condition that we sign up to European single market rules and regulations. Britain will also be told to keep paying tens of billions of pounds into EU coffers.But as far as Mrs May is concerned, some of these concessions would be worth it rather than risk Britain exiting with no deal.A successful outcome would be an unmitigated triumph for our embattled Prime Minister.It would also prove wrong all those who have likened her Chequers strategy to a dodo.Barnier, Juncker, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Blair, Vince Cable and her detractors in the media would all have to eat humble pie.          European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, (middle right) embraces British Prime Minister Theresa May (middle left) after a meeting at EU headquarters in Brussels Oct 16, 2017Some, such as the most dyspeptic hard-line Tory Brexiteers, would, of course, refuse. They would unsheath daggers at next month\u0027s Conservative Party conference and hurl shouts of \u0027betrayal\u0027.But the truth is that such a Brexit deal with the EU would honour Mrs May\u0027s promise to the British people that Brexit would mean a free trade area for goods no more free movement of people across our border leaving the Common Agricultural Policy taking back control of UK waters by quitting the Common Fisheries Policy supremacy for UK courts and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice.This weekend, the Tory Brexit rebels are gravely weakened. The first sign of this emerged when their European Research Group (ERG) faction failed to put forward cogent proposals for how Britain would survive outside the EU if Mrs May\u0027s Chequers deal collapsed. Also, all the foment about a leadership challenge to Mrs May proved to be nothing but a mirage.Furthermore, awkward questions are being asked about the funding of the ERG, with a possible investigation by parliamentary watchdogs into a secret bank account used to pay for wining and dining supporters.While these high-stakes politics are being played out, it is vital to remember that the referendum ballot paper in June 2016 asked voters to make a simple choice: whether they wanted to remain in, or leave, the European Union.There were no stated terms on which Britain might leave.Considering the way politics has descended into the gutter during the 27 months since then, Theresa May has climbed bravely to near the pinnacle of the mountain.How apposite that, next week, it will be beside the majestic Alps, in Salzburg, that she might start to believe that an honourable Brexit is finally within reach.  Cook\u0027s first-class retirement           Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket after playing for more than a decade at the top of his professionEvery leading politician should learn from the dignified way that Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket.After playing for more than a decade at the top of his profession, he will continue to turn out for his Essex county team for another three years.What a contrast with both Tony Blair and David Cameron, who abruptly abandoned the House of Commons after standing down as prime minister.This point was well made by Labour MP Chris Bryant, who said that the two men should have remained in front-line politics to offer the benefit of their years of experience.In previous ages, ex-prime ministers often stayed on as MPs. A notable example was first-class cricketer Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served as foreign secretary in the Heath government for four years after he lost the 1964 General Election as PM.Intriguingly it was Sir Alec who once famously said, years before Britain joined what was then the Common Market, that the embryonic union of European countries was \u0027a dead duck that could not quack\u0027!  Despite their shrill accusations about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, the Tories have a serious anti-Semitism problem of their own.This was disgracefully demonstrated by Conservative MEPs\u0027 support for the hard-Right Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, who has waged a long, vicious vendetta against the Jewish philanthropist George Soros, accusing him of plotting to take control of the country.Orban has made inflammatory comments about Muslims and hailed a Hungarian leader who collaborated with the Nazis during the Holocaust as \u0027an outstanding statesman\u0027.This week, Conservative MEPs opposed a motion in the European Parliament which condemned Orban for attacking minorities and suppressing free speech and press freedom. They were the only governing party in Western Europe to do so.Although Theresa May\u0027s spokesman dissociated her from her colleagues\u0027 vote, I cannot believe that Tory MEPs would have acted in this way without covert approval from No 10.If this is the case, it is a most misguided policy. For at a time when Brexit talks are in the balance, Mrs May needs every morsel of support from fellow European leaders, and must not offend them by linking Britain with the odious Orban. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/14/19DD622C00000514-0-image-m-19_1536930123649.jpg","title":"British intelligence chiefs thought former Labour leader Michael Foot paid Soviet informant","story":"    Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg GordievskyMI6 believed claims made by a Soviet defector that former Labour leader Michael Foot was a paid KGB contact, according to a new book.Intelligence chiefs were reportedly briefed on the politician’s KGB history in 1982 and were prepared to pass on the information to the Queen had he become prime minister after the following year’s general election.Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg Gordievsky, were first published in the Sunday Times 23 years ago. At the time he dismissed the claims as a ‘big lie’ and successfully sued the paper for libel.But documents, published in The Spy and the Traitor, show that MI6 thought the evidence presented by Mr Gordievsky was strong enough to pass on to the Queen.In a 1982 debriefing, the former agent allegedly said the KGB had paid Mr Foot the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money, according to the new book.Even though he was supposedly paid by the Soviets, Mr Gordievsky said that the politician was not a ‘spy or conscious agent’.Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleInstead he was allegedly a contact who was paid for ‘disinformation purposes’, meaning he might have been fed false information.Mr Foot lost the 1983 election to Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Party, helped in large part by Britain’s victory in the Falklands War.Author Ben Macintyre wrote: ‘Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election. It was agreed that should a politician with a KGB history become prime minister of Britain, then the Queen would have to be informed.’           The double agent (pictured) said that the Labour leader was an informant for the KGB  MI6 chiefs were so concerned about Michael Foot\u0027s (pictured, right) alleged links to the KGB that they were prepared to pass information onto the Queen  (pictured, left, in 1982) The journalist also revealed that the information was ‘too politically incendiary’ to show to Margaret Thatcher.The allegations made against Mr Foot were detailed in a 400-page file labelled ‘Agent Boot’.The word ‘agent’ is believed to have been later crossed out when Mr Foot was demoted to a ‘confidential contact’. The file claims Mr Foot was first contacted by Soviet intelligence while working at the left-wing magazine Tribune in the 1940s.Mr Gordievsky also made claims about how the Soviet secret services had infiltrated other factions of the Labour Party, which had become increasingly left-wing in the early 1980s.The party’s 1983 election manifesto, which outlined several socialist policies, was later dubbed ‘the longest suicide note in history’ by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Mr Foot resigned following the election defeat and three years as Labour leader. He died in 2010 aged 96.Trade union leader Jack Jones was also listed as an ‘agent’ by Mr Gordievsky. The spy claimed he met Mr Jones for lunch, but found him ‘absolutely useless’ as a contact.Mr Gordievsky became a double-agent for MI6 in the 1970s, later rising to be head of the KGB’s London station in the early 1980s. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/12/4EBC9D5E00000578-0-image-a-14_1533121538202.jpg","title":"New eSports degree university students play computer games coursework","story":"    Students at the University of Chichester will pay total fees of £27,750 before living costs  be required to play FIFA, Counter- Strike, League of Legends and Project Cars as part of the degree.

A home that, she says, holds so many happy memories.Josie today is a successful textile artist and she’s turned her old bedroom into a studio. She refuses to dwell on the horrific events that would seem utterly insurmountable to most of us: ‘I don’t remember very much, she said. ‘We just carried on with life. We went out and did normal teenage stuff. I’m not a victim, I’m not a survivor. I’m just me.’Asked how she overcame the tragedy she added: ‘I think being really, really busy. I just get on with life and just carry on. I love my job, it’s all fine. Happy.’Josie’s story came in the week one report said that a quarter of teenage girls are suffering from depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. Another shockingly revealed that one in four 14-year-old girls self-harm.I am not for a moment denigrating these girls who are clearly suffering, subjected as they are to many pressures — not least the constant hateful judgment of their peers on social media.My point is that Josie gives them hope. She proves you can overcome adversity, no matter how terrible. Far from indulging in victimhood and self-pity, she is determined to make the best of her life.Her greatest joy today, apart from planning life with her fiancé, is her Mum’s pony, Rosie, which she used to ride as a child. ‘Now Rosie’s quite old, I take her for walks,’ she said.What a tribute she is to her father Shaun. And what a role model for troubled young girls everywhere.  Asked what her favourite shops in London are, Victoria Beckham says her own, of course. And Daunt Books. Posh reading anything but fashion glossies? Give me a break. Or is this her famous sense of humour?   Just Dance, KateWhen Strictly began it was about the dancing, not the sob story. Now we have lovely Kate Silverton (left) pleading special privileges because, at 48, she’s ‘a late-in-life mum and recently menopausal’.

Of the Princess, he said: ‘I told her before anything had happened it would end in a lot of pain for us both, but it would be a lot of fun along the way.’ Fun for the women-magnet Hoare perhaps, but not for the two women he left heartbroken.   Joanna still Ab FabBefore she took to the Silk Road on ITV this week, some wondered how Joanna Lumley (below), now 72, would manage the gruelling 7,000-mile journey from Venice to China.She was, as always, sublime. From Purdey in The New Avengers back in the Seventies to Ab Fab’s Patsy in the Nineties, we’ve remained entranced by her.Forget TV ageism.

She clutched her 11-week-old baby to her bosom in the chamber.She didn’t make a speech, as it happened — although her virtue-signalling on behalf of the sisterhood spoke louder than words.          Is it any wonder these pampered politicians are now considered so out of touch with real folk?Imagine what would happen if a young mum arrived at Tesco’s for her eight-hour shift on the tills with a baby strapped to her chest.  In a self-selecting survey, today’s pious 18-year-olds say they are less likely to drink than the previous generation, yet are much more lonely.

I’ll drink to that.   As the new face of M\u0026ampS, Holly Willoughby proudly wears clothes from the High Street giant, despite being worth £21million.

Here are 10 of the most mind-meltingly, brain-bogglingly, heart-stoppingly creative records to have ever been nominatedPrimal Scream (1991) For the two albums that came before Screamadelica, Primal Scream were just another fey and jangly Scottish indie band. Enter DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall, who harnessed Bobby Gillespie and co’s interest in London’s buzzing late-80s acid house scene and helped turn it into a euphoric, hedonistic and era-defining record. Loaded is the hit, Slip Inside This House the inspired cover version and Don’t Fight It, Feel It the definitive instruction on how to do ecstasy-inspired raving properly.Spice Girls (1996)A short list of people who grew up listening to the Spice Girls: Little Mix, Charli XCX, Katy Perry, Adele. And Spice was the wildly enthusiastic in-yer-face dance-pop record that – thanks to enormohits Wannabe, Say You’ll Be There and Who Do You Think You Are – launched Ginger, Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and the “girl power” slogan into the mainstream quicker than you could say “zig-a-zig-ah”.Massive Attack (1998) Deep, dark, doomy and graceful, Mezzanine is trip-hop’s crowning glory. Teardrop is the most famous track, but Inertia Creeps, Risingson and Angel are just as harrowingly atmospheric. Made at a time when the mood within the Bristol band was terse, Massive Attack’s third album pongs of alienation, isolation and fear, and the trio became a duo shortly after the release when Andrew Vowles, aka Mushroom, jumped ship (or was pushed off).The Streets (2002) On which 23-year-old Birmingham boy Mike Skinner takes the sound of two-step UK garage and decorates it with often funny, frequently poignant and always relatable raps about, as he puts it on Has It Come to This?, a “day in the life of a geezer”. Booze, drugs, clubs, pubs, PlayStations, heartbreak, the quantity of fried tomato a fry-up requires – it’s all on there, still sounding fresh. Put on your classics and have a little dance. Dizzee Rascal (2003)Until the release of Skepta’s Konnichiwa in 2016, Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner was the grime album. Released when the genre was still relatively young, it’s a frighteningly raw and angry take on the realities of growing up as a working-class kid in east London. Looking at the artist Dizzee has become, it’s hard to remember the shy teenager who raps so furiously about knife crime (Stop Dat), underage sex (I Luv U) and everyday violence (Seems 2 Be) over ice-cold beats that reflect the hopelessness of his situation. But he’s there, and he’s a genius.MIA (2005) There’s a lot to get your head round on the debut album from the London via Sri Lanka rapper. The title: MIA’s dad’s codename when he was in the Tamil Tiger militant group, given to the record in the hope he would one day Google himself and see what his daughter had made (he did). The sound: multicultural trans-global party music that nicks bits from all over the world, most notably hip-hop and dancehall. The lyrics: explorations of politics, culture, food, sex, war and revolution. Truly invigorating.The xx (2009)Listen to this debut album now, and you might think you’ve heard it all before. But none of London Grammar, Banks, Alt-J, Lorde or James Blake sounded like that before xx. Really, the only band that sounded remotely like the xx before the xx were late-70s Welsh post-punks Young Marble Giants. But the genius of the London band’s update on YMG’s minimal guitar sound is the use of cutting-edge production to create 11 spooky mini-epics that tell late-night tales of love, lust and longing.PJ Harvey (2011)From the moment she announced Let England Shake on the Andrew Marr Show in April 2010, telling the presenter: “My biggest fear would be to replicate something I’ve done before”, you knew Polly Jean Harvey’s eighth album would be special. Suspicions were confirmed when, 10 months later, an ambitious portrayal of the horrors of world war one and its aftermath appeared, featuring lyrics about soldiers falling “like lumps of meat” (The Words That Maketh Murder) and a country whose “fruit is deformed children” (The Glorious Land) in songs that took in folk, rock and pop, mostly made with guitars but with dashes of harp and sax in there too. PJ wasn’t done there though, and asked war photographer Seamus Murphy to make a video for every track to complete a fantastically creative vision.FKA Twigs (2014)Four years since Tahlia Barnett released her debut album, there’s still nothing quite like it. In a way it’s doomy alt-R\u0026ampB but just like, say, Bjork in her pomp, there are so many risks, ideas and moods on LP1 it would be unfair to label it. There are sad songs (Pendulum), sexy songs (Two Weeks), romantic songs (Hours) and vulnerable songs (Closer), a mega list of producers (Clams Casino, Sampha, Twigs herself and more) and a whole load of vocal experimentation. Yet it comes together because FKA Twigs, alien pop star extraordinaire, is right at the heart of all of it.J Hus (2017) The way J Hus’s debut brings together grime, garage, bashment, dancehall, afrobeat and early 00s hip-hop is as exciting as British music gets. Tunes like Bouff Daddy, Did You See and the title track are carnivals of ideas, and the east Londoner is comfortable rapping sensitively, playfully or aggressively over any style he’s given. The focus, though, is always on his extraordinary life that’s featured a multiple stabbing. It’s the unique sound of modern multicultural London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9084b03d7a1a74cabac4ba6cf26774ce5e230eee/0_285_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1d0b3ada2008017d7468e03a305943b","title":"conrad shawcross review victoria miro gallery london","story":"Victoria Miro Gallery, London Science smashes into art in this staggeringly ambitious attempt to map out reason itselfI can’t remember the last time an artist explained a body of work to me by referring to Thomas Kuhn’s 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Come to think of it they never have before. According to Kuhn, the history of science progresses not through evolution but sudden “paradigm shifts”. One line of thought is developed until it hits the buffers and slips sideways into a new way of thinking. Or as Conrad Shawcross put it while we looked at his latest abstract sculptures: interlocking tetrahedrons are stacked up as high as they go until they reach the point of overbalancing.According to Shawcross, who talks intensely and eloquently about his own work, he is modelling scientific thought, reason itself. Interesting stuff – but what does it add up to artistically? I dismiss the artist so I can look properly at his art.Like Islamic tiles tessellating in infinite mathematical patterns, the columns rising all around are made of flat shapes that float in dreamlike symbiosis, their glancing planes supported by tree-like armatures. They suggest natural forms both organic and inorganic: the multifacted brilliance of minerals, the interlocking cells of plants. Shawcross is clearly fascinated by the idea of a structure that expands from nothing in defiance of gravity. In these variations on a geometrical theme he uses contrasting metallic surfaces – rusted, wiry, mirrored – and allows them to hang free in space. It is as if a solid compact structure is dissolving before your eyes. I suppose that’s why the exhibition is called After the Explosion, Before the Collapse.Shawcross is infectiously exhilarated by science and maths. His art mirrors the wonders of life and space. A series of photographic images he calls Aberrations bring to mind early astronomical photographs, or even the drawings the 19th-century scientist Michael Faraday made of iron filings radiating around a magnet. Black wisps and waves, shadows and stains spread in a white emptiness. These are arresting abstract mappings of force, energy, gravity – and chaos.The universe is being born and it is dying in Shawcross’s art. Atoms are coming together to create structures of astonishing elegance and complexity. And yet they are about to be blasted apart, the laws that bind are on the cusp of failing. Order must come to chaos so that chaos can cohere into something new.It’s refreshing to see an artist taking on such intelligent themes without descending to easy figurative gimmicks (you know who you are, Antony Gormley). Abstract art can explore places other art cannot reach. It can map the cosmos and glimpse quantum reality.In a window of the gallery two perforated metal discs revolve against each other to create an ever-changing pattern of lights. Like a clear midwinter night sky, it is a starry glimpse of the infinite. Shawcross is making art that very nearly keeps up with the beauties of contemporary science."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee79cff6e75c1916c086b36353b873bd13af01d4/0_547_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a6d989d4c535f986617e4f52f0c952d","title":"a history of herbie the vw beetle over the years in pictures","story":"The car pioneered in Nazi Germany and immortalised in Hollywood will cease production in 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d056d4540e3ee5800f5f38dc8a21fd35b0d43f5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cd3b0a1d4becd93a9505d62355e4a81","title":"jeff bezos low income people pay amazon workers better","story":"Always a pleasure to hear from rejected Paul Verhoeven villain Jeff Bezos, who this week announced an initiative designed to cast him as Earth’s first trillion-dollar sociopath. OK, I’ve paraphrased slightly. The Amazon boss has launched something called the Day One fund, which feels like the will-this-do title for the will-this-do initiative it is. Bezos has long been criticised for his glaring lack of a philanthropic arm, long after he became the richest man in modern history. A year ago Jeff seemed at such a loss as to how not to be an unmitigated arse that he was asking internet users for ideas. He seems to have ignored all the respondents who said, “Stop treating your workers like rubbish.”Do you remember the beginning of Verhoeven’s Robocop, before things started to go really tits-up in increasingly automated future Detroit? There’s a company that basically does everything, called Omni Consumer Products. They begin providing services that might reasonably be imagined the job of the state. A movie ensues. Anyway, here we are. Fresh from announcing that Amazon’s getting into healthcare, Jeff has decided to help homeless people and low-income communities with donations and not-for-profit schools.“We’ll use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon,” he explains, encouragingly. “The child will be the customer.” Mmm. Customers who bought this nonsense also bought the line that Elon Musk is a humanitarian, and that Mark Zuckerberg went to crucial early-primary states last year because he wanted to “share stories” with ordinary Americans.Off the top of my head, Jeff has already had two very clear chances to help homeless people and low-income families. The first was in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, and where the firm recently killed a proposed city tax on big firms to alleviate the homeless crisis by threatening to halt a building project. The second was by simply paying his own low-income workers better. As the old saying goes, charity begins in aisle 89 of the Amazon warehouse, where workers are so terrified of being docked points for nipping to the bathroom that they’re pissing in bottles.But guys like Jeff don’t want governments, or properly paid worker ants, taking credit for what is, after all, his bounty. The rule you learn on Day One of being a billionaire philanthropist is that you don’t give money via pay packets to the poor people who literally already work for you. They’d only spend it poorly. However, if they want to humbly queue up and apply for it via some thinly disguised hardship grant that you take the applause for, that’s a different matter. Dignity is something you hand out, not something that others get to earn. I missed this bit in The Wealth of Nations I guess there’s a sealed section.And the warm glow doesn’t even end there for you. There is an entire industry of confected philanthropic awards set up to honour givers such as Jeff. The rest of us need simply wait for the first story of an Amazon worker who has to throw themselves on the mercy of Bezos’s charitable arm in order to bump themselves up to living-wage territory. Consider that the ouroboros of giving a toss. Maybe the story will appear in the Washington\u0026nbspPost, the totemically revered newspaper Bezos owns, and which he receives a ridiculous amount of credit for simply leaving editorially alone. And maybe it won’t.There is, of course, a third way in which all the tech gazillionaires who want to make the world a better place could do so, but from which they all somehow seem to recoil: tax! Last year Amazon’s UK profits trebled but its tax bill fell.How can anyone who doesn’t pay decent tax be referred to as a “philanthropist”? Sorry to bring Jeff and all the others down to the level of the little people – the nurses and teachers and bricklayers and so on – who do pay a proper whack of their meagre salaries toward the societies in which we all, including Jeff, live. But you don’t get to order turbo-accountants to chisel every last legally loopholed cent off your responsibilities, then swan in with a tiny percentage of what you’ve saved and expect to be treated like the effing messiah.Looked at in the round, Jeff is just another emissary of that specific class who make you ill just so they can sell you the cure. See also Gwyneth Paltrow, whose Goop website is always detailing madam’s various health issues, then trying to flog the fringe lunacies that presumably cause half of them. And see also the Conservative party, who’ve spent the past few years breaking everything then telling you only they can fix it.The greatest trick all this lot ever pulled is convincing\u0026nbsppeople that they are the answer, as opposed to the problem. Incredible to think that as recently as 10\u0026nbspminutes ago, people were still chummily tweeting Musk along the lines of, “Counting on you to get us to Mars and escape Trump, dude!”Guys? Elon’s not going to save you. Elon’s going to call you a “pedo” if you have the temerity to rescue some kids without using his non-bendy mini-submarine. Elon is – how to put this? – an intergalactic shit. In the fantasy realms where he has the ability to colonise Mars, he’s going to take fellow intergalactic shits like Jeff up there, in a sort of tech-bro version of the Rapture, and the last thing the rest of humanity is going to see as he blasts off is the word PEDOS, spelled out in a nuclear-firework goodbye.

That’s the striking consequence of a high court decision from this morning.Late last year, the Good Law Project (GLP) – of which I am director – sued the Electoral Commission in the high court on two grounds. First, it challenged the adequacy of the commission’s investigation into spending by Vote Leave. And second, it said that the EC had got the law wrong around donations.Having initially said that both grounds were “without merit and not conceded in any respect”, the commission agreed to reopen its investigation into Vote Leave’s spending. It ultimately agreed with GLP that Vote Leave and Darren Grimes – founder of youth group BeLeave – had broken the law. Both have now been referred by the commission to the police.This morning’s high court judgment deals with the second strand of GLP’s case – that the commission got the law wrong in taking the view donations could not count as spending.Back in September last year, in a now deleted tweet, Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, admitted that the commission had given Vote Leave the “extremely surprising” ruling that it could donate surplus monies to other leave campaigners.And Vote Leave went on to do exactly that.Because Vote Leave was up against its spending limits, it couldn’t spend in its own name. But the commission ruling opened the door for it to donate £620,000 to Grimes to pay for advertising services he purchased from AggregateIQ – the same data analytics and online advertising firm Vote Leave had been using for similar services – and to donate £100,000 to Veterans for Britain (which was also spent with AIQ).Stronger In was also up against its spending limits. But because it didn’t get the advice from the commission, it had to stop spending. And this morning the high court decided that advice given to Vote Leave by the commission was wrong. The consequence is that the commission unlawfully tilted the playing field.What does all this mean?First, the commission – charged by statute with ensuring campaigners complied with the law – instead allowed Vote Leave to break it. The high court decision is absolutely excoriating: the commission was “unconstructive”, its actions lacked “any rational basis” and were “arbitrary”, and its approach to the law was a “recipe for abuse of the spending restrictions”. Heads must roll, beginning with that of Bob Posner, the commission’s legal counsel.Second, the inevitable consequence of the high court decision is that Vote Leave has broken the law in two different ways: once with “common plan spending” with Grimes – the matter already referred to the police, and where Vote Leave acted without commission sign-off – and once by following the commission’s unlawful and “extremely surprising” advice.And fourth, there may be profound implications for the Democratic Unionist party. A BBC investigation by Jim Fitzpatrick suggests that the Constitutional Research Council – which donated £435,000 to the DUP to spend on “Vote to Leave” ads in the  newspaper (which is not published in Northern Ireland) and on AIQ – also controlled how that donation was spent.If that is the case, a consequence of the high court’s decision will be that the council will have unlawfully incurred referendum expenses substantially in excess of the £10,000 limit, and so will have committed a criminal offence. The Good Law Project intends to write immediately to the EC inviting it to commence an investigation into the CRC – and threatening further judicial review proceedings if it will not.These are not the findings of a government agency. These are the conclusions of the high court – and an immensely powerful court at that. One of the judges was a court of appeal judge at the time of the hearing, and the other is a court of appeal judge now. They have concluded that the regulator mismanaged the referendum. And the consequence is that Vote Leave has broken the law.The government regulator in charge of ensuring the referendum was fair itself acted unlawfully and tilted the playing field in favour of leave. This isn’t democracy: it’s an embarrassment.• Jolyon Maugham QC is the director and founder of the Good Law Project"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e322856cb1f17f9ce218c1148182795a69c8ce45/49_0_2414_1448/master/2414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14a455bb2d91cc08c6968faf74b7586a","title":"lies russia rt salisbury suspects putin","story":"Comedy is now diplomacy by other means. A mighty nation has taken to conducting a grave international dispute by means of humour, expecting a similarly comic response in kind. How else are we to view the interview granted with RT, the state propaganda outfit formerly known as Russia Today, by the Morecambe and Wise of the east, the two men who identified themselves as Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov?Posing as Russian sports nutritionists, a professional fraternity whose record is not entirely unblemished, the\u0026nbspcomedy duo told the channel that they were indeed\u0026nbspthe men the UK authorities had identified as visiting Salisbury in March, but they hadn’t made the trip\u0026nbspto kill the former spy Sergei Skripal. On the contrary,\u0026nbspthey were there as wide-eyed tourists, lured by the prospect of seeing a cathedral “famous for its 123-metre spire”. Wasn’t it odd that they had visited Salisbury so briefly on the first of two consecutive day trips?\u0026nbspNot at all, the TV funnymen insisted: these strong sons of the Russian winter had had to abandon their first attempt to see the sights, deterred by the impassable Wiltshire slush.Titter ye not, as fellow TV comedian Frankie Howerd might have put it. But titter we have, as the Boshirov \u0026amp Petrov show has spawned a thousand parodies. Their purported explanation was laughable and we have duly laughed. But is it the right response?What is the best way to deal with these egregious assaults on truth by two of the world’s most powerful men, one an authoritarian autocrat, the other a would-be authoritarian autocrat?Laughing in their faces has great appeal. It avoids dignifying garbage with a serious reply and rightly pricks the bubble of grandiosity that envelops all dictators, both actual and aspiring. But it comes at a cost. Lost in all the spire gags, for example, is the fact that the two Russians are credibly accused of using chemical weapons on British soil – and that a woman, Dawn Sturgess, is dead from novichok poisoning.More to the point, and though it sounds po-faced, to laugh at the RT interview is to risk collusion with it. Putin surely knows this alibi of his is absurd and easily debunked, and yet he offers it anyway. Part of that is the usual Kremlin trick: the weaponisation of doubt, throwing up enough chaff to enable Russia’s defenders to say the picture is unclear, the truth is elusive and no one can ever really know for sure.But it’s also more brazen than that: offering up a risible explanation whose very implausibility confirms\u0026nbspthat Moscow simply doesn’t care. The humour is intended to humiliate Britain: we killed on your territory and now we are laughing at you. To which Downing Street’s unsmiling condemnation of Russia’s\u0026nbsp“lies and blatant fabrications” may well be the right reaction.In that spirit, perhaps the best way to reply to Putin and Trump is with a calm, methodical debunking of their falsehoods. In the Salisbury case, CCTV sightings of the two men have made that easy. This approach has the virtue of winning over the undecideds, including within international opinion, as they watch Moscow and London slug it out. There is also a moral dimension: lies should not be allowed to stand without rebuttal.But here too there are problems. Defeated on the first hundred facts, the most ardent defenders of the Kremlin narrative will simply move on to the next hundred: their ingenuity in explaining away hard evidence is a bottomless well. It also risks a descent into what my colleague and longtime Putin-watcher Luke Harding calls “Versionland”, in which there is no single truth grounded in fact but competing versions.At best, even if you regard debunking as a necessary exercise it is hardly sufficient. The media has a special responsibility here, and there are small, specific actions we should take. Denying a megaphone to the likes of Alex Jones – who claims, without evidence, that the Sandy Hook massacre of elementary school children was faked – is a welcome first step.But news organisations need to drop the assumption when covering either Trump’s White House or Putin’s Kremlin that they are dealing with actors who play by the accepted rules of fact and veracity. That means you can’t simply tweet out a headline saying “Trump: 3,000 did not die” without effectively spreading his lies for him. And it means you can’t give the 8.10am interview slot on Radio 4 to a man presented as a fellow journalist when that man is in fact a functionary of the Russian state. Still, we will have to go further.In a thoughtful new book, Denial: The Unspeakable Truth, Keith Kahn-Harris draws a useful distinction between traditional denialist movements – which sought to construct “towering edifices of pseudo-scientific evidence” to support their claims – and what he calls post-denialists, who are much more cavalier. Rather than make a detailed case like, say, the climate-change deniers of old, post-denialists simply assert.Putin on Salisbury and Trump on Puerto Rico are perfect examples of this new post-denialism, says Kahn-Harris. They are in the business of “asserting their power to shape reality according to their will”. Casting aside the niceties of facts and evidence, post-denialists are inching closer to saying what they really think: while an old-school Holocaust denier would say Auschwitz never happened, a post-denialist might say it did – and that it was good. On this reading, Putin is getting closer to saying: “Sure, we did Salisbury: what of it?” With Trump, it’s, “Puerto Rican lives matter to me less, because their skin is the wrong colour.”If this is what’s happening, it requires a different response. It means getting to the heart of the matter, tackling the underlying, if repugnant, belief rather than focusing on the facts, or gags, that lie on the surface. It means responding to Trump not with data, but with a moral argument for the equal worth of all human life – and to Putin with the moral case against chemical weapons.Perhaps that does not feel like the struggle for today. But it is fast becoming one of the urgent questions of our time: how do we defend the truth in a world of lies?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24755184fe1077c4446c4b4f9ea2130","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Jerry Brown announced plans for the satellite on the last day of a climate change summit hosted by San Francisco, in a final rebuke to President Donald Trump’s denial of man-made warming.“With science still under attack,” Brown said “we’re going to launch our own satellite, our own damn satellite, to figure out where the pollution is.” Brown said the satellite will help pinpoint the source of planet-warming emissions.California will team up with Planet Labs, a company run by ex-Nasa scientists. The data collected, including on carbon dioxide emissions and methane leaks from oil and gas operations, could be made public as part of a partnership with the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund. The new project comes as Trump has proposed slashing Nasa climate research mission budgets. It is one of dozens of commitments of mixed significance unveiled by states, cities and businesses at the event.Despite the optimism on show at the summit, Kerry said climate efforts must ramp up.“I am going to tell the truth, and the truth is we are not anywhere near where we need to be with respect to the overall challenge of climate change,” said Kerry, who worked to secure the 2015 global Paris climate agreement under former president Barack Obama.Kerry blasted Donald Trump for deciding to leave that deal, calling it “one of the single greatest acts of irresponsibility by a president of the United States anywhere at any time.”Leaders of the countries already suffering most from sea-level rise and ocean acidification echoed Kerry’s concerns, saying that international action is slowing.“The world has lost, all of us have lost, momentum since Paris in 2015. Although the rate of increase has slowed, we’ve not yet peaked our global emissions. But we must do so by 2020. We really cannot afford to wait any longer,” said Mia Mottley, prime minister of the Caribbean island nation of Barbados.Mottley’s country is in the direct path of hurricanes that are growing in strength and may narrowly avoid a more direct hit from tropical storm Isaac this week.The world is set to watch temperatures rise 3C above pre-industrial levels by the time a child born today is old, Mottley said, even if countries adhere to the goals they said.Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, said countries need to speed their work.“We all know that the levels of ambition in our national plans need to be ramped up because we are not on track to meet the targets of the Paris agreement,” Bainimarama said.Former US vice-president Al Gore struck a more positive tone.“We must do it. We can do it. I’m convinced ever more because of the success of this summit here in San Francisco that we will do it,” he said, reminding that the US has not technically left the Paris deal yet and that a new president could re-enter.The warnings were at odds with the overall atmosphere of the summit.On the eve of the gathering, California governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that would make the state’s electricity supply carbon-free by 2045. A separate executive order by Brown is more sweeping, committing to net zero emissions across the entire California economy, also by 2045.Other cities and regions from around the world have followed this with various pledges, with New York City promising $4bn to renewable energy and clean water and cities including Los Angeles, Tokyo, Honolulu, Oslo and Greater Manchester pledging to build energy efficient buildings or deploy fleets of electric buses.A group of 29 philanthropists committed $4bn over five years to combat climate change, the largest such investment of its kind, while companies such as Ikea, Walmart and Unilever promised to reduce emissions through measures such as electrified trucks for deliveries and action to prevent deforestation in the tropics.Jonathan Pershing, the State Department’s climate negotiator under Obama, said the summit brings hope to the climate cause.“The story here is optimistic. The question here is does the optimism translate, and can this message get out globally,” Pershing said. “There is a good broad cross-section of people from around the world, but it’s just a few thousand people, and it’s a problem that’s going to require engagement by millions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309b93271c7f9d750ae9526cef526a929b652398/1924_0_1337_802/master/1337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f5e59c9ec6383e389dedc6a388b664","title":"gel like see through fish discovered 75km down on pacific ocean floor","story":"Scientists have been surprised to find three new kinds of snailfish thriving deep in the Atacama trenchScientists have discovered three new species of “hardcore” fish living in one of the deepest parts of the ocean, the see-through, scale-free creatures perfectly adapted to conditions that would instantly kill most life on Earth.An international team of researchers used state-of-the-art underwater cameras to find the new fish at the bottom of the Atacama trench in the eastern Pacific ocean at a depth of 7,500 metres (24,600 feet) – and were surprised at their abundance in such an inhospitable environment.“These things are right on the limit of what all fish can take so you might expect at that depth you’d maybe be lucky to see one or two eking out an existence,” Alan Jamieson, senior lecturer in marine ecology at Newcastle University told AFP on Friday.“But there’s a whole heap of them sitting there.”Temporarily named the pink, blue and purple Atacama snailfish, the previously unknown creatures are 20-25cm (8-10 inches) long, translucent and have no scales.They appear to be uniquely adapted to conditions four-and-a-half miles beneath the ocean surface, where the days are permanently pitch black and water temperatures barely top 2C (36F).At such depths, the pressure is so great that larger animals would be crushed under their own mass.“It’s the equivalent of having an 800kg weight placed on your little finger,” Jamieson said.Researchers believe the fish may have evolved to live on the sea floor to avoid larger prey.“The hardest structures in their bodies are the bones in their inner ear, which give them balance, and their teeth,” said Thomas Linley, a Newcastle research associate who went on the expedition.In fact, being made almost entirely of a gel-like substance, the fish would die without the crushing pressure holding them together.“Their bodies are extremely fragile and melt rapidly when brought to the surface,” Linley said.The Atacama trench runs almost 6,000km along the west coast of South America and bottoms out at 8,000 metres.Jamieson said the team’s discovery should give hope to researchers working to uncover new species in some of the least-explored corners of our planet.“The finding of new species is not limited to small stuff in the mud or tiny jellyfish, here there are three species of fish about 20-25cm long,” he said.“The Atacama trench is the same size as the Andes mountain range. If we can put a camera down and pick out three new species within a matter of days ... these things are not rare – they are just out of reach.”With more than 300 known varieties of snailfish, Jamieson said it has adapted to a wide variety of conditions, some extremely tough to survive in.“Most of them live at shallow levels – we even get them up the Tyne river in Newcastle. They’re an amazing family that has sort of evolved to fit every niche, every corner of the planet,” he said.He nevertheless admitted to being impressed with the newly discovered varieties and their ability to thrive in some of the harshest environments on Earth.“The water temperatures in these trenches are always less than 2C – that in itself is pretty hardcore, let alone slamming 800-bar pressure on it and hardly any food,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76e9f3ef46f6099b05e55d4d68410dd97c9292d0/0_39_3604_2164/master/3604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0287f3c791969aa6437f620fb0c7590f","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A cuddly lion and a rescued baby gibbon are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb48e248d1d433fed0802a46fadc2e257f50e7bb/0_187_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c9f43ce1e214a2ece30bbc5916045c2","title":"batsheva hay prairie dresses new york fashion week","story":"Batsheva Hay, whose dresses have been worn by Natalie Portman and Amandla Stenberg, became fashion’s unlikely new name with her showcase at a Tribeca dinerNew York’s churches and art galleries begin readjusting back to their more humdrum daily life as New York fashion week comes to an end on Friday and the baton is hurled over to London. The biggest shows were marked by a sense of futuristic escapism and dominated by celebrities: Migos rapper Offset, the Hadid sisters and Rihanna – who had her own Savage X Fenty show – stole the majority of the headlines.Yet there was one event that felt not just more old-fashioned, but positively pre-Raphaelite. Held in a diner in Tribeca, it showcased new pieces by Batsheva Hay, the New York fashion designer whose ankle-length, Orthodox Judaism-inspired prairie dresses have made her the unlikely hottest new name in US fashion.Hay grew up in a secular Jewish family and married Alexei Hay, a fashion photographer who lives as a devout Orthodox Jew, in 2012. She worked as a corporate lawyer, but in 2016 her life changed when she needed to get an old Laura Ashley dress that she loved repaired. Inspired by the modern Orthodox women of New York who were increasingly in her life, as well as mother’s love of prairie dresses and what she describes as the “kinderwhore” aesthetic of Courtney Love, she decided to make some addendums to the dress: a higher neck, more corseted waist and sleeve ruffles. While she was there, she had a few other dresses remade in a similar pattern, using second-hand fabrics she’d bought on eBay. When she wore the dresses, she says she received tons of compliments and began making more to sell online.Her frum fashion house quickly took off, counting Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, Amandla Stenberg and Erykah Badu among its famous fans. The New Yorker recently ran a profile on her, in which Hay gladly describes the dresses as “frumpy”. In the same piece Lena Dunham, another devotee, sums up why they are so popular: “They really look like the party dresses that you would’ve wanted when you were six, or like the dresses that characters in your favorite book would have worn.”This week’s diner show was Batsheva’s first time exhibiting at one of the major fashion weeks, although there was not a catwalk in sight. Instead models ate food and drank milkshakes, while journalists and guests were invited to do the same. The show was well received although occasionally damned with faint praise: the influential fashion journal Women’s Wear Daily said there was something “strangely compelling about Hay’s audacious treatment of a look that should have no place in modern society”.The highest flattery, one might argue, has been imitation. Recent shows by Coach, Erdem and other big-name brands have started to draw on the Amish prairie orthodox look. She’s also a finalist for the CFDAVogue Fashion Fund, perhaps the most influential prize for new designers. Not content with ruffling sleeves, Batsheva Hay seems to be ruffling feathers in the fashion industry too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97102ac1f4cee0062fd9a724cff17e7cadd68a5/0_189_2259_1355/master/2259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=189d10a0c4bbf540fa73b131adf111c4","title":"alex chung makes london fashion week debut designer british fashion","story":"It’s all change this season as a new mood of bankability resonates through British fashionNine years ago, Alexa Chung was at London fashion week as a Mulberry muse, watching from the front row as the £750 Alexa satchel named after her starred on the catwalk. This weekend she is back in a different guise, taking her first bow as a designer, when her Alexachung label takes to the catwalk in Bloomsbury on Saturday morning.It is all change on all fronts at London fashion week. A shake-up has resulted in the most radically different schedule in years. Chung’s debut is followed by the first London catwalk show by Victoria Beckham, a trophy transfer from New York fashion week. Monday will be dominated by the debut at Burberry for Riccardo Tisci. The multiaward-winning fashion designer, with a cult following and an appetite for controversy, has promised to reinvent London’s biggest luxury brand – a reboot with the potential power to change what British fashion stands for. There is a new mood of bankability in British fashion. “The latest statistics are unequivocal. The industry is now worth £32.3bn, and growing three times faster than the rest of our economy,” said Justine Simons, the deputy mayor of London on Friday, before taking her seat for J JS Lee, whose show took place alongside those of fellow designers Bora Aksu, Matty Boven and Ashley Williams on the first full day of fashion week.Last week’s announcement that Chanel is to move its centre of global operations to London has further bolstered commercial confidence, and a Downing Street reception for fashion week on Tuesday is expected reflect a newly businesslike mood. What is more usually a cocktail-hour celebration of design talent and creative excellence will this time be an afternoon reception “focusing on the fashion business and the importance of international trade”. Talking about her transition from muse to founder and creative designer of a label, with a team of 30 employees, Chung said: “It might look like a weird trajectory from the outside, but it’s no surprise to me that I’m in this position now.“What it signifies is that people are more openminded about what being a fashion designer means. We are less hung up on provenance. If a person wasn’t trained to make a dress, does that put you off the dress? Does it matter, if it’s a beautiful dress and it makes you feel great when you put it on?”Prepping for the show from her office in Dalston, east London, Chung namechecked Beckham and Kanye West as designers from non-traditional backgrounds who have made an impact on fashion week.Holed up in her Hammersmith headquarters in west London with two days to go before her show, Beckham pronounced herself “delirious” with nerves at being in the London fashion week spotlight. Some of her most loyal customers are flying in from Australia and Mexico for the occasion. “I’m always under scrutiny. And yes, I always feel it, but I try to ignore it and to focus and do the best job I can. And I try to keep my sense of humour, because that helps,” she said.Marking her 10th year as a designer, Beckham is ready to put her “foot on the gas” and expand her brand, with a beauty range in the planning stages. “I have learnt a lot being at New York fashion week, where we were surrounded by very business-minded brands,” she added.Chung’s latest collection is based on what people wear in transit. “Airports are such emotionally charged places. I travel a lot, and I people-watch.

Professor Tim Spector, author of The Diet Myth, has a theory that the French are slimmer because they eat funky cheeses full of good bacteria that are vital for a healthy digestive system.The aftercare of cheese is as important as the making, and my local cheesemonger’s advice is to keep it wrapped in wax paper in a container in the bottom drawer of the fridge, where there’s higher humidity (cheese likes to breathe, so doesn’t like plastic), and to scrape off any mould that forms, to prolong its life.Cheese is expensive, so it makes sense to enjoy it in its entirety. The rind can be powerfully flavoured, and most (except on waxed cheeses such as gouda) is edible. I leave the rind on when I take a slice of cheese, because it adds flavour, but some nubbins inevitably end up lost at the back of the fridge, slightly dry and without a home.If you have a similar collection of cheese ends, don’t feed them to the compost monster. Instead, put them in a jar and make a classic fromage fort. My friend Fadi Kattan, a Franco-Palestinian chef, taught me his own potent version: “Squash the old cheeses with a fork, add three bottle caps of armagnac per 250g cheese ends, mix and put in a jar. Leave to ferment for two to three weeks, adding more armagnac if it becomes dry. Then enjoy!” If you’re short of time, try my quick method.Blend cheese ends with half the amount of wine, a slice of garlic and a sprinkling of leek tops. Serve on toast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85776e1b7cf98fd815fda0bf89c14f712f93519a/0_0_4919_2952/master/4919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=625c60af4e8429cd1fbb9043e4d04fbd","title":"watford javi gracia premier league","story":"This week Troy Deeney let slip details of the system of fines introduced by Javi Gracia this season. “They used to be done by the players,” he said. “This year the gaffer took charge and he’s made it so all the fines are very steep and nobody’s messing about. I think everybody likes their money too much.” By way of example he said that latecomers to training are now penalised at the eyebrow-raising rate – even if it still is not the stiffest such penalty in the ision – of £100 a minute.“I think the group needs discipline,” says Gracia, who has alsoramped up fines for a variety ofoffences including missing physiotherapy appointments and not turning up for yoga. “For me it’s most important to convince the players we don’t need the rules. If we have good behaviour, if all of you are thinking in the same way, we don’t need the rules. Then it’s perfect. But you need to show them the way and they have to respect that. If one of them makes a mistake then they pay, but the objective is not to take away money. The objective is they respect the rules.”Watford have won all four of theirleague games, using a team composed almost exclusively of players who wereat the club a year ago, and with the same manager who oversaw the final 15 games of the last campaign without great success. But it is a squad, and a manager, in many waystransformed, utilising a different formation, pressing higher and faster, more disciplined off the pitch and on it.Gracia was appointed in January with the team in freefall as Marco Silva’s spell unravelled ignominiously, and was thrown into the pell-mell pandemonium of the English mid-season, one he faced with the added complication of an injury crisis. “When I arrived for my first training session, I remember there were 15 players injured or out of the team,” he says. “And it’s not easy to manage that situation. Back then I can’t say I prefer to play this way or the other way. The most important was to see the players I have. And with these players, what can I do? We needed points, and I tried to look for the way.”The Spaniard experimented with a variety of formations and permutations. His team played with three at the back and with four, with Tom Cleverley in the middle or on the left, with Richarlison on the left or in the middle, with Troy Deeney as the lone striker or with Andre Gray. On one occasion, just for an hour, he tried both strikers together. This season the starting XI has not changed, with Roberto Pereyra and Will Hughes deployed, curious as the concept sounds, as narrow wide midfielders, and Deeney and Gray in partnership.“Time is the most important thing,” Gracia says. “When I arrived we only had three or four days to prepare for the next game. Pre-season was very good for the players, for me, to know each other more and to prepare for the competition. Time together is the key, because training is the only time when you can improve the level of the players, the level of the team.”Their pressing is excellently organised and in certain situations, such as when opponents have throw-ins in their own half, extremely aggressive.“We have a different squad,” Gracia says. “Maybe I am a different coach, because I try to change day by day. I don’t want to waste time waiting to see what happens. I want to look for something, to look for a way to improve, a way to do better today than yesterday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ffe56e2e206bc25462697bdfa4ef30722edbe5/345_531_1568_941/master/1568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f9717cca27fd5dbb11cb1012a3b5446","title":"a lurking beast polio casts shadow over papua new guinea independence day","story":"Sunday should be a day of celebration but the outbreak has brought anger at a lack of health funding while millions are spent on the Apec summitAt a waiting room in Port Moresby’s Gerehu general hospital red, gold and black balloons – the colours of the country’s flag – deck the walls in the build-up to independence day.Around the back in the stifling heat, nurses are administering vaccine drops from cool boxes. About 30 adults and children are queuing under a canvas tent, awaiting their dose to protect against polio, a disease Donald Lippert, a Catholic bishop from the Southern Highlands, characterised as “a beast lurking in the darkness, ready to spring forth”.The number of confirmed cases has risen to 12 up from 10 earlier in the week, and health authorities have confirmed the disease has reached the capital, Port Moresby, after the diagnosis of a six-year-old boy in an area called Five Mile. The other children affected are in remote parts of the country, and the first case surfaced in June.The health crisis has cast a shadow over the developing Pacific island country as it prepares to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of its independence from Australia on Sunday. Tribal dancing, agricultural shows and flag raising ceremonies are among festivities scheduled.Nason Aguleko, an accountant, has brought his 16-year-old daughter Catherine to be immunised along with her grandmother.The family plan to travel to Australia at Christmas to spend time with relatives. A polio vaccination is now part of visa requirements.Aguleko recalls the lives ruined as a result of the disease when he was growing up. “I’ve seen quite a number of people paralysed from polio over the years,” the father-of-three tells the . “If someone is affected you can’t support yourself, there is no independence and dreams and aspirations are lost.”The World Health Organisation declared PNG polio free in 2000. For Generation Y Papua New Guineans, like architect Rita Karaie, 27, there isn’t much awareness about the consequences of the disease. “I don’t even know what the symptoms are,” she says, as she lines up for her turn.Sister Kenegalato Waligia is a nurse at the hospital and her team has vaccinated 50 to 80 babies each morning this week. “When the outbreak came up we started to see a lot of panicked mothers,” she says. She says more resources are needed to increase PNG vaccination rates.Over recent years there have been funding cuts to mobile clinics travelling to settlement areas and remote villages to vaccinate children. However, these clinics are set to receive a major boost in the coming months.The PNG government has instigated a program to vaccinate 3.3 million children under 15, starting in the capital on 24 September and rolling out nationally from 1 October.There has been some community resentment over healthcare funding being stretched, while the PNG government ploughs millions into hosting world leaders for the Apec summit in November.Jennifer Elsibai, Save the Children’s Pacific regional director tells the . “I think that the country is facing really incredible fiscal constraints, and Apec is a very obvious use of the government’s budget and it’s an easy place to direct your anger, especially if you’re a member of a community that is faced with a health facility that isn’t adequate to meet your needs.”Polio is an infectious disease transmitted through contact with food and water contaminated with the faeces or saliva of infected people. It’s rare in most parts of the world because of the success of immunisation programs but Somalia, Kenya, Congo and Nigeria have recently experienced outbreaks.Efforts to eradicate polio from Afghanistan and Pakistan have been thwarted because of political instability."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9885be5398f4aa0270d132126b30af1237354deb/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da2e3258af98e7f2f2db315c6fbd0ccc","title":"blind date amber ellie","story":"What were you hoping for?My future life partner and co-parent to our children.

How I had cancer a few years ago, and how we tried and failed to have children and lost pregnancies through IVF. I wonder if we maybe looked like a sad couple who needed saving, or people so desperate we couldn’t contain ourselves?As it turned out, you’d apparently wanted to be a surrogate since you were little, had loved more than anything the experience of your own pregnancy, but didn’t want more children, so this was, well, ideal.I think what stings the most is not that you couldn’t do it in the end, but that you sought us out, telling us you really wanted this, for you, for us. Did you just like the sound of your own voice saying you were going to be a surrogate? Had you not thought through any, all, of the details at this point?On finding out about you through a mutual connection, and sharing the news with my husband, I felt a palpable sense of joy from him. One I hadn’t seen in a long, long time. I think he’d given up hope, and given up wanting hope, because it was too painful to be let down. The three of us had positive and exciting conversations. We arranged to meet, the date was on. Just you and me, because that was easier – let’s not make it too massive at this point, was the thought. Only it was, already, from the minute you appeared: how could we not think this ridiculous option might be our chance?

I wish it hadn’t even been on the table.When a door to your dream home opens, how can you not start checking out the floor plan?

I have to suppress an urge to runI visit our nearest shop, on average, twice a day: in the morning voluntarily and again later, because I’ve been sent. You might imagine that I’m on friendly terms with the staff by now, but I conduct my business with a certain distracted urgency, like a ghost who is double parked. If I went missing, no one there would recognise my picture.On Thursday morning, before my first trip to the shop, I answer the front door in bare feet, a towel and a T-shirt with wet patches all over it.“Looks like we got you out of the bath!” the woman on the step says. She is holding a copy of the Watchtower.“Yes,” I say. Steam rises off my damp arms.“Would this be a good time for a chat?” she asks.“Not really,” I say. I do not say what I am thinking, which is: I thought you were the wine I ordered.“Well, we’ll let you get back to your ablutions!” she says.I think: my ablutions are not your business.I return to the bath with the Watchtower, and read an article titled Does God Notice You? The article quotes Matthew 10: “But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.” I do not find this comforting.Later, I go to the shop, floating through the automatic door, grabbing milk up one aisle, coffee down the next and landing at an empty self-checkout bay. I feed in a handful of change, but the machine will not accept the last 50p in any combination of coinage.“Is there a problem?” the man at the till says.“It hates my money,” I say.In the end, the till man has to void the transaction, run it through again at his machine and credit me for the coins I’ve already put in. “Have a nice day,” he says.I think: that wasn’t how that was supposed to go, at all.At 7pm, my wife looks into the refrigerator. “You’ll need to go to the shop,” she says.“I’ve already been to the shop!” I say. I say this every day.I chant the items we need to myself as I head out of the door. This, I think, will be my most low-profile expedition yet.The shop is busy when I arrive, but that doesn’t slow me down. I slide past the security guard and snatch some eggs. One item is unavailable, but I make a quick substitution before collecting some cat food on the final turn. As I scan my stuff, I’m already rehearsing the inevitable conversation about the substituted item. It’s all they had, I will say.I grab my bag by the handles and slip into the night. As I cross the street, I become aware of a voice calling,“Hello”. It can’t be anything to do with me, I think, because I’m basically invisible. But the voice is weirdly insistent. “Hello,” it says again.I turn to see the security guard standing on the pavement.“Me?” I say.He waves me over.“Did I forget something?” I say, looking into my bag. Then I realise: I forgot to pay. Then I realise that it looks more like I just stole everything. I have to suppress an urge to run.I follow the security guard back into the shop to the checkout, which is displaying a warning about nothing being in the bagging area. A manager has to be sent for.“I guess I was just distracted,” I say.“Someone is coming,” the guard says. He doesn’t seem angry – just mildly mortified on my behalf – but nothing in his manner dispels the feeling that I’m about to be arrested. I imagine myself issuing impassioned denials that make me sound more guilty.A manager arrives, punches in his ID, resets the machine and walks off. I tap my card against the reader and it beeps.“OK, sir,” the guard says, nodding.I consider the strong possibility that this man, whom I’ve walked past countless times without a word, let me go because he actually recognised me as a regular, heretofore law-abiding customer. I walk home in the dark, thinking about the numbered hairs of my head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dad0378d9602cb2d59bcdbc9af90f45cf5e05159/252_128_1478_887/master/1478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dce5e70a176f18dff930a01ce581f38","title":"tv journalism netflix calling bim adewunmi","story":"It’s been odd to appear in Follow This, a documentary where BuzzFeed reporters (my day job) report on subculturesYears back, I decided that I was going to be a pharmacologist, because it seemed a practical, smart direction to take in life.

You won’t have the same problem with an audiobook. You may even find yourself so enthralled that you run an extra mile without noticing Last year, when Peter Johnston turned 50, he had a life crisis. The Stockport native had a successful career as an IT consultant, a loving wife, two young daughters, and plenty of friends to go to the pub with most evenings. But on his 50th birthday, as he went into his bathroom to shave, he remembers not liking what he saw in the mirror.“I was evidently overweight, pale skin, bumps all over my face – you name it. I didn’t look good at all.” He admits that it’s probably a phase that most men his age tend to go through, a “realisation that you’re now definitely old, and that it’s going to be more difficult to keep up in the same way I used to be able to”. Which scared him, especially because he wanted to be healthy enough to play with his daughters and be a good dad for them as they grow up. He decided to take up jogging, with the aim of running his first half-marathon before his 51st birthday. He bought new running shoes and gym clothes, and his wife helped him set up a music playlist on his phone. He was all set to go, but he found his runs difficult.Not because he wasn’t able to endure them, but rather, that listening to music was not right for him. “After a while, I’d get bored – especially when you’re listening to the same tracks again. Don’t get me wrong, I love ACDC, but there are only so many times I can listen to Shoot to Thrill. Or, when you aren’t feeling a track but you can’t change it without interrupting your run,” he says. “Worse,” he adds, “when you’re in a busier area, like a high street, and you want to change the song, you have to keep jogging, while playing with your phone and making sure you don’t run into anyone. It’s a nightmare.” A work friend recommended that Johnston change his tune not to other forms of music, but, rather, to audiobooks – full-length books told through high-quality audio narrations, and presented in formats similar to podcasts. The medium has grown rapidly over the past five years, particularly on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones – and Audible now provides the world’s largest selection of audiobooks. According to the UK’s Publishers’ Association, around one in 10 Brits are now listening to audiobooks, while spending on the medium has more than doubled in the past five years to a total of £31m. Research commissioned by Audible from University College London earlier this year showed that audiobooks produced a stronger emotional and physiological response compared with visual storytelling mediums such as TV and video streaming, regardless of the genre of content being listened to. For Johnston, listening to audiobooks has multiple benefits. For starters, he says: “I’m actually reading a lot more.” He started off with Yuval Noah Hari’s Sapiens: A History of Humankind, which Johnston described as one of the “most thought provoking listens” of his life. “When you’re running, and listening to what’s basically the origin of human thought, why we do what we do, it’s pretty amazing,” he says. “I was listening to it while running through the countryside one weekend, and I was so engrossed in it, thinking about what was being said, and how that shaped the world around me I’d forgotten about my distance completely. I’d run a mile longer without even realising.” And it’s not just while running that he’s found audiobooks useful. Like millions around the world, he also listens to audiobooks when doing general day-to-day activities such as driving, doing household chores, and even when he’s relaxing in the bath. His favourites tend to be non-fiction titles, with one recently being Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, which he stumbled on while browsing recommended titles on Audible. “It’s such a fascinating book,” says Johnston. “And it’s told in a really interesting and engaging way that’s humorous, but also really exciting. I wasn’t really that good at science in school, but I learned more about quantum physics from listening to that book while doing the laundry the other week than I did in four years of studying it at school.” Johnston will turn 51 in October. Since his birthday, he’s 12kg lighter, leaner, and says he feels “better than I’ve ever done in my life”. And that’s not just in his physical fitness, but, thanks to audiobooks, mentally too. “I’ve been able to discover all these things that I otherwise wouldn’t have the time to go out looking for,” he says. “I can browse through the library on my phone, or just type in a subject I find interesting one day and voila – I’ll find loads of books I can listen to at the tips of my fingers.”“Audiobooks aren’t just a way of keeping me entertained while I run miles,” says Johnston. “They’ve given me the opportunity to learn something new every day.”Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff2d4b0a6f7c1bb72395a0b3f14a599081790d4/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=befccf24b044b2d19702ca4a8e600399","title":"finally a cure for insomnia","story":"We are living through an epidemic of sleeplessness, but the medical establishment has largely ignored the problem. Can a radical new therapy help you get some sleep?We live in a golden age of sleeplessness. The buzz of the all-night streetlamps, the natter of 24-hour news anchors, the scrolling Niagaras of social media feeds have built a world that is hostile to sleep. Night is no longer clearly delineated from day. The bedroom is no longer a refuge from the office. The physical and psychic walls that once held back the tides of work and social interaction have failed. As the essayist Jonathan Crary put it, sleeplessness is the inevitable symptom of an era in which we are encouraged to be both unceasing consumers and unceasing creators.To the wakeful, insomnia can feel like the loneliest affliction in the world. But an estimated third of British adults suffer from chronic insomnia, defined as having adequate opportunity but inadequate ability to sleep, for a period of at least six months. Insomniacs dutifully set aside a seven-or-so-hour stretch for rest. They make the bed. They draw the curtains. But when ear kisses pillow, they are suddenly wakeful. Many have sought help. Between 1993 and 2007, the number of people in the UK who visited their doctor complaining of insomnia nearly doubled, while NHS data shows, in the past decade, a tenfold increase in the number of prescriptions written for melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep.The effects of insomnia can be ruinous. In his recent bestseller, Why We Sleep, the neuroscientist Matthew Walker wrote: “The decimation of sleep throughout industrialised nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our life expectancy, our safety, our productivity and the education of our children.” A 2016 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, claims that insomnia increases the risk of heart attack, cancer and obesity. Insomniacs are far more likely than sound sleepers to suffer from chronic depression. Insomnia is related to all major psychiatric conditions, including suicide risk (although there is still a debate as to whether sleeplessness is the cause or the symptom). Each year, as many as 1.2m car crashes in the UScan be attributed to tired drivers.None of this is news to the droopily Googling insomniac who, fearing obesity, heart disease, accident and poverty, is subjected to yet further sleep-skewering anxiety. Fearing their problem is untreatable, or that no doctor will take them seriously, many people who suffer from insomnia never seek medical advice. And in Britain, where doctors are hesitant to prescribe sleep drugs for longer than a week or two, who can blame the insomniac? There are a few NHS sleep clinics in the UK, where patients can be tested for the respiratory issues that often cause sleeplessness, but waiting lists are dispiritingly long. Moreover, for decades, inside the British medical establishment there has been only a glancing interest in insomnia, a specialism that one consultant refers to as the “Cinderella of medicine”.“We have very little at our disposal,” Clare Aitchison, a GP with a practice in Norwich, told me. “In a 10-minute consultation it’s impossible to teach people to break bad habits.” With so few options, doctors resort to advisory cliches. Take a hot shower before bed. Eat a banana. Switch off your phone. Read a book. Masturbate. These titbits often have some basis in science or logic. But when the insomniac has tried them all (sometimes simultaneously) where do they turn?At the root of Selsick’s approach is a revolutionary assertion that has led to a new approach to treatment, quite unlike the old wives’ tales with which, in the absence of a coherent medical solution, every insomniac will be familiar. Where, for decades, insomnia has been treated as a symptom of another issue (if indeed it has been treated at all) Selsick contends that insomnia is not merely a symptom, but a disorder in its own right. This remains an unorthodox view. Yet, for Selsick’s patients, the approach does more than fix a category error: it provides a life-changing validation, a route out of helplessness, a way of getting to sleep.I have come to hate my bedroom. What should be a place of rest and, in a good month, the odd romantic scuffle, has become a psychic battleground. Since I turned 18, the process of drifting off has become ever more easily torn. The pops and creaks of the settling house are enough to pull my wary brain from its slow descent. The sound of a lorry, or an orgasmic fox, can keep me tossing fretfully till 3am, the hour at which, as Ray Bradbury put it, we insomniacs glumly watch as “the moon rolls by ... with its idiot face”.In the nagging light of the alarm clock, emotions grow heightened. The slightest wiggle, tut or guff from a bed partner is enough to arouse fury, as I’m whooshed back to a state of bounding wakefulness. The paradoxical exasperation of the insomniac is this: the more you try to sleep, the more you fail. So here I must lie, tipping from fury to dismay, contemplating the various ways in which the coming day is fucked.It is impossible to explain to the sound sleeper what it is like to not sleep. Still, the writers and artists try. “Night is always a giant,” wrote Vladimir Nabokov, of the foreboding sense of peril he felt on entering his bedroom. (One of Nabokov’s insomniac characters wished for a third side after trying and failing to fall asleep on the two he had). Chuck Palahniuk, whose novel Fight Club was inspired by insomnia, would have to imagine picking and losing fights in order to drift off. F Scott Fitzgerald, not a writer prone to hyperbole, described insomnia with sullen childishness as “the worst thing in the world”.Over the years I have developed rituals and incantations: the solemn depositing of the phone in a separate room, the scorching shower, the banana nightcap. As the fear of sleeplessness builds over weeks and months, obsessive, quasi-superstitious behaviours become established. Vincent van Gogh would pour a turpentine-like liquid on his mattress, a decanting intended to cast the spell of sleep. WC Fields claimed he could only fall asleep to the sound of rainfall, and his dutiful lover Carlotta Monti would spray water from the garden hose against the bedroom window till he dropped off (today, a range of apps can provide similar soothing soundscapes).These eccentricities have, perhaps, enabled the rest of the world to view insomnia as a minor affliction. As well as feeling scorned, the insomniac comes to develop a sense of shame. Sleep is the most natural thing in the world to fail makes the sufferer somehow unnatural. So it was with panda eyes and an anxious mind that I slipped through the front door of the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine in Great Ormond Street, London, to meet the doyen of insomniacs.Hugh Selsick cannot be absolutely certain, but he estimates that he has met more insomnia sufferers than any other person in Britain. Yet, when he enters the waiting room for his insomnia clinic, he has no idea which one of the expectant faces is his patient. Most long-term insomniacs show none of the telltale physical signs of fatigue. It’s a hidden, private affliction.Selsick places extraordinary importance on this initial meeting with a new patient. He knows that they may have been suffering from insomnia for decades, a period over which they have seen multiple family doctors, who have time and again given them the kind of advice you might give a fretful child: take a warm bath or a glass of milk before bed. When he sits down with the patient for the first time, Selsick’s primary goal is simply to let them know, perhaps for the first time in their lives, that someone is about to take them seriously.“For years nobody has understood what this person is going through,” he told me, as we sat in his narrow office. “Then suddenly they are sitting in front of someone who says, ‘Yes, I can see this is a problem, and yes, we can treat this.’” Some patients well up. Others hold their heads in their hands, in shocked relief. Whatever the reaction, Selsick, who is soft-spoken, kind-eyed and bald as an acorn, said that, in that moment, a bond of trust is established that is stronger than any other he has known in his career as a psychiatric doctor.In this, our first meeting, I felt something of that emotional intimacy. Through shame, or a worry that he might think I was trying to jump the waiting list, I had not mentioned my own struggles with sleeplessness. His kind manner, and open acknowledgment of the pervasive awfulness of insomnia, was both comforting and thrilling.Still, the insomnia clinic’s reputation has not been made on bedside manner alone. Selsick has designed a five-week programme that combines cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), designed to break a person’s negative associations with their bedroom, and the entire business of drifting off, with something Selsick terms “sleep efficiency training”, a calibrated reduction of the amount of time the patient spends in bed.Today, Selsick and another consultant run the clinic with support from a GP who works one day a week and an associate specialist psychiatrist, who is supported by a trainee. Patients travel from around the country to visit, and about 80 patients visit the clinic’s weekly group classes. “We are constantly expanding, but we are still battling to meet the demand,” Selsick said.How is a central London clinic successfully treating an illness that, for decades, medicine has failed to adequately address? The answer appears to be rooted in Selsick’s belief that insomnia is not merely a symptom of another, higher-order condition. For decades doctors would treat the primary condition – diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems – expecting that fixing this would help the patient to sleep. This approach would often fail because, as one study puts it, insomnia is maintained by the “behaviours, cognitions and associations that patients adopt as they attempt to cope with poor sleep but that end up backfiring”.Selsick believes that only by treating insomnia as a psychiatric disorder, with degrees of severity that range from mild to chronic, can the health service begin to develop and prescribe appropriate treatments. It is a pioneering attitude that is motivated not only by scientific curiosity, but by personal experience Selsick knows insomnia’s debilitating effects first-hand.Selsick became an insomniac in 1993, when he was 19 years old, staying on a kibbutz in the desert in Israel. It wasn’t just the heat that caused his sleeplessness it was also the routine built around the heat. With temperatures reaching 40C, desert-dwelling people typically sleep from 11pm through to 3am, at which point they start work while it is still cool enough. At lunchtime, when the heat is at its most ferocious, they take a siesta. It was a custom that Selsick’s mind resisted he would lie awake in the afternoons, feeling exhausted, but wired.When he returned to South Africa to start his first year at university, studying medicine in Johannesburg, Selsick’s insomnia persisted and intensified. “It’s almost impossible to describe what it’s like, to someone who hasn’t had it,” he told me. One day on campus he saw an advert posted on a wall requesting volunteers for a sleep study. Selsick enrolled in the hope that he might discover what was happening to him.The study hoped to find what effect, if any, calorie intake had on a person’s ability to fall asleep. Each experiment lasted for four days, during which Selsick and the other volunteers would stay overnight at the sleep clinic, one monitor strapped to their head, another, to monitor core body temperature, inserted into their rectum. Volunteers were kept to a specific diet. One week they would fast for 24 hours the next eat three times their typical calorie intake. Then they were monitored to see what effect the food had on their sleep. “It turned out to not make a difference,” he recalled.Inspired by the professor who ran the course, Selsick began a postgraduate degree in physiology, based within the sleep clinic, where he studied the functions of REM sleep – a phase that occurs sporadically through the night, characterised by rapid eye movements – then carried out research on the impact of central heating on sleep patterns. (The ideal temperature in which to sleep is cooler than you might think: just 18C. This is one of the reasons why insomnia affects a disproportionate number of people in nursing homes, where round-the-clock heating makes it harder for the human body to cool down in readiness for sleep.)At this time, the use of psychotherapy to treat insomnia was still in a relatively early phase. Selsick estimates that it was 2005 before therapists began to undergo insomnia training, in order to apply research findings. When Selsick came to London in the late 90s as a trainee doctor at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, his own insomnia had passed. Still, he was astonished to find a widespread lack of interest within psychiatry toward insomnia. “Ask any patient with psychiatric conditions what troubles them,” he said. “Sleep is almost always at the top of the list.” Selsick started a mailing list for any psychiatrists who were interested in sleep and held a conference at which members shared their findings. The group caught the attention of his supervisor, Charlotte Feinmann, a consultant psychiatrist at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) who, while Googling “insomnia”, recognised Selsick’s name in a search result. She sent him a text message asking whether he would be interested in founding an insomnia clinic at the hospital.“At that time nobody was treating insomnia,” Selsick recalled. “Mental health units weren’t taking insomnia patients sleep disorder centres were not treating insomnia, partly because they were being run by respiratory physicians screening for sleep apnoea, who didn’t have the relevant skills.” A patient who did not fit that box would be “bounced around the NHS”, Feinmann said. While staff across the health service were aware of the need, Selsick said, they knew that if they were to take insomnia referrals they would be inundated.Selsick accepted Feinmann’s offer and, in November 2009, his first two patients walked into the clinic. He started small – one afternoon a week. “I had no idea what I was doing,” he recalled. Indeed, in its early months, Selsick’s consultancy offered little more than routine advice on basic sleep hygiene, such as limiting caffeine intake (“not effective”) and some general tinkering with the dosage of whatever medication the patient was already taking (“not very effective”).Then, a few months later, Selsick began to explore CBT. For those who suffer from insomnia, the bedroom is so strongly associated with wakefulness that the mere act of going to bed wakes the patient up, in much the same way that walking into a dentist’s office makes you anxious. CBT, which at the time was just starting to be used to treat insomnia in North America, works to change patients’ automatic, often unconscious, association of the bedroom with wakefulness and replace it with bedroom and sleep. “Immediately,” Selsick said, “our results were enormously better.”Not everyone was convinced by the new programme. Selsick’s clinic is situated within the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, formerly known as the Royal London Homoeopathic hospital, a controversial centre for alternative treatments. The pharmacologist David Colquhoun once described the hospital as a “great national embarrassment”. Selsick believes that this association caused some GPs to not refer their insomniac patients. “When we explain that we are a psychiatry-led service that practices evidence-based medicine, those issues usually melt away,” he explained.Ideally, the patient’s answers establish a pattern, which can lead to a diagnosis. Sometimes that diagnosis is narcolepsy, nocturnal epilepsy or sleepwalking – one of the scores of conditions that can lead to sleeplessness. In other cases it is, simply, psychiatric insomnia.When she was 13 years old, Zehavah Handler took a pen and scrawled a dot on her bedroom wall in north-west London. Lying on the bed, she could just pick out the mark in the milky glow of her nightlight. There, as the house settled around her, she would challenge herself to stare at the dot for as long as possible without blinking. The game became a ritual and, eventually, became the only way, she believed, that she could fall asleep – although it was often 4am before she finally drifted off.In adulthood Handler, now 40 and a mother of four, still suffered from insomnia. She would wake at 7am to drop her children off at school, then lie down on the carpet of her bedroom. There she would watch the ceiling till mid-afternoon, her heart palpitating with exhaustion, when she would leave for the school pickup. After feeding and bathing the children, Handler would retire to her own bed. She would lie in bed for 12 hours, only sleeping for an hour or so before the dawn broke and the day’s grim routine began again.When she began to experience memory loss and irritability, Handler visited her GP. After an 18-month wait, she entered Selsick’s office. “It was the first time I met a professional who acknowledged the problem and was truly empathetic.” Handler was admitted to UCLH’s clinic to be monitored overnight for sleep apnoea. On arrival, Handler found the consultant in charge that night “extremely dismissive” of Selsick’s clinic. She spent the first night in a nest of wires, like an android recharging its batteries, lying awake worried about whether or not the machines would know that she was just pretending to be asleep. Nevertheless, the results came back clear: she had no breathing issues, no twitching muscles. Selsick concluded that Handler was one of his many patients for whom insomnia is not a symptom of some other disorder, but the disorder itself.In May 2016, Handler joined Selsick’s five-week course, along with nine other anxious patients. The programme takes place in a small room in the bowels of the hospital. Handler remembers that none of her fellow patients talked and few made eye contact, paralysed by the secret shame of the insomniac. “Everybody was very self-conscious,” she recalled. “We were wondering: ‘How’s it going to work? How much will we have to reveal of ourselves?”To figure out how much sleep they need, each attendee is told to start a sleep diary, recording what time they go to bed, what time they get up, how long it took to fall asleep and how many times they wake during the night. Next Selsick undoes the idea that a person should have a set bedtime. Typically, insomniacs will go to bed earlier or stay in bed longer in order to increase their sleep opportunity. The logic appears sound – if I’m not getting enough sleep, I should spend longer in bed to give myself more opportunity to sleep – but the anxiety invariably exacerbates the problem. Instead, patients are told to set a hard-and-fast time to wake up. “We tell them to always get up at the same time every day, regardless of how much they’ve slept, what time they’ve gone to bed, or what they’ve got to do that day.”There must never be any lie-ins, and never any naps (chewing gum, Selsick says, keeps napping at bay). The theory is that if you get up at the same time every morning, you begin to feel sleepy at the same time every night, and, over the weeks, your bedtime will naturally become consistent. “We compress their time in bed down so that their sleep is more compact and tighter,” explained Selsick. A patient might start with a goal of six hours’ sleep. If they need to be up for work at 7am, this means they are forbidden from entering the bedroom till 1am. “That’s now your earliest permitted bedtime.”Selsick worked to break the negative associations Handler had with her bedroom. When insomniacs go to bed they often feel afraid of having to lie there frustrated and increasingly irritated. After a while the simple act of going to bed begins to wake an insomniac up. The bedroom becomes a trigger toward alertness, even fear. To counter this, Selsick urges patients to leave the bedroom after just 15 minutes if they are not yet asleep. All activity apart from sex and sleep is barred from the bedroom. Patients are even told to change their clothes in another room.“Before, I would go to sleep in the afternoon and be in my room for 12 hours,” said Handler. I would make all my phone calls there, work on my laptop there, eat and watch TV in bed. That’s gone. All gone. I say goodbye to my room at about 7.20am and I don’t see it again until 1.30am when I go to bed.” The technique often feels counterintuitive on the initial nights that a patient shuffles between bedroom and lounge every 15 minutes, they often sleep worse. “It’s extraordinarily hard to do,” she said. But after about five weeks, the negative psychological association of the bedroom with wakefulness has been broken, and replaced with new, positive connections. Selsick claims that, using these techniques alongside the moderation of stimulants such as caffeine, eight out of 10 patients get better, and half of these go into, he said, “complete remission”.Studies show that CBT is the most effective long-term treatment for insomnia. But in order for it to be effective, it requires the patient to establish and maintain a stable routine. For patients who regularly cross time-zones, who often stay in unfamiliar hotel beds or who are unable to form a nightly ritual because of work, Selsick’s plan presents an impossible target. These patients want not a timetable to which they must stick, but a pill they can swallow.Surprisingly perhaps, for a doctor who strongly advocates the use of CBT in treating insomnia, Selsick believes that sleeping pills should be far more widely prescribed in the UK. “There’s an incredible conservatism in the British medical establishment about prescribing for sleep,” he said. Much of this anxiety is focused on the addictive qualities of benzodiazepines. According to the neuroscientist Matthew Walker, sleeping pills do not provide “natural sleep,” can “damage health” and “increase the risk of life-threatening diseases”.“The drugs, like any drug, are not without risk,” said Selsick. “But having untreated insomnia also comes with risks.” Selsick has met patients who, because of insomnia, have been forced to leave work and abandon careers. “I’ve had patients where it’s destroyed their marriages, where they have lost access to their kids because they are so tired that they can’t look after them properly.” Nevertheless, Selsick perceives a blanket policy among doctors whereby they refuse to medicate for sleep. This policy, he says, does patients a disservice. “Yes, CBT should be your first port of call prior to medication. But most places in the country do not have access to CBT. And not everyone who does CBT for insomnia gets better.”The arrival of any epidemic brings commercial opportunities. In 2006, the manufacturer of the non-benzodiazepine sleeping pill Ambien estimated that the drug had been taken 12bn times worldwide and is worth $2bn a year in American sales. Pharmaceutical companies hoping to replicate this success are locked in a race to design a new sleeping pill without side-effects. The discovery, in 1998, of orexin, a hormone that essentially works as the brain’s alarm clock, turned the long march to develop a new kind of sleeping pill into a sprint.For the past 15 years Jean-Paul Clozel – a cardiologist turned pharmacologist who in 1997, co-founded the Swiss biotech firm Actelion with his wife, Martine – has been leading the development of what he claims to be the side-effect-free sleeping pill. “Most sleeping pills are benzodiazepines,” says Clozel. “They induce something that feels like sleep, but in reality, it’s closer to anaesthetic sedation.” (Benzodiazepines are often used by anaesthetists.) Clozel’s pill, which he hopes to take to market in 2020, and which goes by the generic name Nemorexant, works differently. It limits the production of orexin, the hormone that keeps insomniacs awake, or causes them to wake up at the mildest provocation.Nemorexant is not the first sleeping pill to target orexin. Since August 2014, more than a decade after work began on developing the drug, American doctors could prescribe Belsomra, also known as Suvorexant, which targets the same hormone. Within a month of its release, US doctors were writing an average of 4,000 Belsomra prescriptions a week. But the drug is not without risks. An FDA report on the safety of Belsomra, which is closely related to Clozel’s drug, quoted one patient who “woke up several times and felt unable to move her arms and legs and unable to speak”.Nevertheless, in a country that is seemingly years away from rolling-out nationwide CBT programmes to treat insomnia, Selsick welcomes the chance to prescribe Neomorexint. “As it acts through a completely different pathway than other hypnotics, it would be nice to have it for those patients who have not responded to the standard treatments.”In the meantime, Britain remains both ill-equipped and, seemingly, unwilling to deal with the growing insomnia epidemic. As victims of the woefully ignored Cinderella of medicine, sufferers struggle to stick with anything that claims to be a cure, leaving us stuck in folklore, with its colourful but contradictory advice. No sleeping pills are licensed for long-term usage, and apart from Selsick’s clinic, only a handful of private psychology services offer CBT to treat insomnia.A plan to open an insomnia clinic at the sleep disorders centre at Guy’s hospital was scrapped due to fears that the demand would be too great. “They were concerned that demand would be so massive they would never meet their waiting list targets, which would result in being financially penalised,” Selsick said. This has resulted in the perverse situation where the more demand that exists to treat insomnia, the less likely it is to be met.In May, to help ease the pressure on his oversubscribed clinic, Selsick commissioned the first insomnia training programme for GPs, an attempt to equip doctors to run, within their local surgeries, CBT sessions similar to those held at the clinic. Eventually, he hopes, this will mean that only the most extreme cases will need to be referred to him. Selsick hopes to run these courses, which are also open to nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists and mental health workers, twice a year and, in doing so, speed up the NHS’s capacity to deal with insomnia at a national scale.Selsick’s clinic is the only surgery to consistently see a significant volume of patients. And consistency is, he said, the key. “The treatment is not rocket science,” he said. “It really isn’t. Our job, primarily, as therapists, is not so much to tell people what to do – because we could just give it to them as a handout – but to convince them to do it for long enough for it to work.”For patients who successfully complete Selsick’s programme, the ability to sleep well changes life at an elemental level. To begin sleeping again is to feel as though you are being realigned with the universe and its guiding, imperceptible rhythms. “I am happier,” Handler told me, of her new life, post-insomnia. “My relationships have improved. I have more patience. I’m no longer walking in a permanent fog. I am available.”There are occasional relapses, Handler said, usually brought on by a change in routine – a holiday away, Christmas – but by waking at a set time, leaving the bedroom after 15 minutes if she remains awake and re-implementing all of the rituals she learned at the Insomnia Clinic, it only takes a few nights to re-establish the routine.The effect has been so transformative that Handler has decided to close her tourism business and, with Selsick’s support, retrain as a sleep counsellor. So great is her relief at learning how to sleep again that Handler wants to dedicate her life to helping others do the same she plans to open her own insomnia clinic next year.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc1089c89ced48c86d6d063991c5e535f40de11/712_280_2596_1558/master/2596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccd556e5fdfdc66d9f6fe5d8903285c1","title":"eu officials refute raab claim that brexit talks are closing in on deal","story":"Minister’s comments on negotiations over Irish border problem seen as optimisticDominic Raab has surprised EU officials and diplomats by optimistically claiming the Brexit talks are “closing in” on a solution to the Irish border problem, following a 30-minute telephone conversation with Michel Barnier.In an an article on Thursday, in which he had threatened to withhold the UK’s £39bn orce bill, the British cabinet minister had told how he was looking forward to continuing negotiations with Barnier the following day.In reality, the two men had a call that lasted about 30 minutes on Friday, sources said. EU diplomats in Brussels also expressed astonishment at the sunny outlook offered by the British cabinet minister over the state of the negotiations.In a statement issued after the call, Raab said: “This morning, I had an extended phone call with Michel Barnier. We discussed the latest progress our teams have made on the withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship.“While there remain some substantive differences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the withdrawal agreement, and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship.”EU diplomats suggested that in reality there was a complete impasse on the most difficult issue of finding a backstop solution that will ensure a lack of hard border on the island of Ireland, whatever the outcome of the future trade negotiations.In a tweet that hinted at the lack of movement, Barnier said: The UK has rejected the EU’s proposal to in effect keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and single market after Brexit, but has not yet delivered on the prime minister’s promise to offer a workable alternative, Brussels claims.In response to Raab’s comments, one senior diplomat said he hoped that the words were a sign that the UK was coming round to the proposal to simply “de-dramatise” the EU’s version of the backstop. “But that is not what Barnier is signalling to me,” the diplomat added.Barnier wants both sides to illustrate to opponents of the EU backstop just how few checks in the Irish sea there would be due to the relative low level of trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.A second EU diplomat told : “In reality this is a matter of who blinks first. And we don’t think it is going to be the EU.”The source added: “Nothing is going to happen until after Tory party conference on their end.”A third said of Raab’s optimistic comments: “On the contrary my understanding is that the UK is refusing to discuss details of how the backstop could function. The EU will continue insisting on that”.Raab suggested in his statement that the highest talks would be put on hold for a week, while EU leaders meet in Salzburg for a summit.Theresa May is due to present her thoughts on the state of the talks over dinner on Thursday night before the EU leaders discuss the outstanding issues over a two-hour lunch the following day.“We agreed to review the state of play in the negotiations following the informal meeting of heads of state or government of the European Union in Salzburg next Thursday”, Raab said, “and we reiterated our willingness to devote the necessary time and energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.”Both Barnier, and most recently the European commission president, Jean Claude Juncker, have also dismissed the central planks of the prime minister’s Chequers proposals of a common rule book on goods and a customs arrangement that would allow the UK to enjoy frictionless imports and export and an independent trade policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ad625564cd5e2078ae400024c0e949f69210da/0_1103_3620_2172/master/3620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54fa82969b8369449aba71a0fe93ed96","title":"three best for britain members refused pass to tory conference","story":"Campaigners for second Brexit referendum, and Russian diplomats, refused passesThree leading campaigners for a second Brexit referendum have been refused passes for the Conservative party conference, prompting them to complain that the governing party is suppressing voices it disagreed with.Eloise Todd, Best for Britain’s director, was among those who were refused passes on Thursday night in a terse email that gave no explanation as to why her accreditation and that of two colleagues was not granted. Russian diplomats have also been refused passes.“The Conservative party can put their heads in the sand but it doesn’t change the fundamental and unavoidable truth that public opinion is shifting away from Brexit,” Todd said. “A party of government should always be listening – even to voices it may disagree with.”The email from the Conservatives informed Todd that “having considered your application for a security pass to attend the Conservative party Conference, I write to inform you that your application for accreditation has not been granted”.Best for Britain will hold a fringe event at Birmingham outside the secure perimeter, with speakers including Phillip Lee, a Conservative junior minister who resigned over the government’s Brexit policy. The group also plans to buy a wraparound advert in the Birmingham Mail and take out billboards to remind Conservative delegates of their campaign.Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum on a final Brexit deal, despite suggestions there is support for the move among senior Tory remainers. On Thursday more than 100 constituency Labour parties submitted motions calling for Labour to back a second referendum.The Russian embassy in London claimed on Friday its diplomats had been denied credentials to attend the Tory conference.“We were given to understand the presence of official Russian representatives at the conference would be undesirable,” the source said.He described the annual conferences of the UK’s leading parties as “important events in the country’s life, in the course of which the largest political forces map out their priorities on a broad spectrum of issues and hold open and frank discussions on the pressing problems of domestic and international politics.On Thursday Downing Street accused Russia of acting with contempt and allowing “lies and blatant fabrications” to be aired on a state-funded broadcaster, after an extraordinary interview with the two men identified as suspects in the Salisbury nerve agent attack was broadcast on Russia Today.The pair, who identified themselves as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, claimed they had been in Salisbury to visit the cathedral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8697002df9ccbf5667c2f9201b7f4ca1331aa470/0_35_1016_610/master/1016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8edde73652f74a05bb2088b2e3e08b7","title":"spectacular ice age wolf pup and caribou dug up in canada","story":"Rare, mummified animals discovered by gold miners in Yukon territoryThe Klondike region of Canada is famous for its gold, but now other remarkable ancient treasures have been unearthed from the melting permafrost.Two mummified ice age mammals – a wolf pup and a caribou calf – were discovered by gold miners in the area in 2016 and unveiled on Thursday at a ceremony in Dawson in Yukon territory.It is extremely rare for fur, skin and muscle tissues to be preserved in the fossil record, but all three are present on these specimens, which have been radiocarbon-dated to more than 50,000 years old.The wolf pup is preserved in its entirety, including exceptional details of the head, tail, paws, skin and hair. The caribou calf is partially preserved, with head, torso and two front limbs intact.“To our knowledge, this is the only mummified ice age wolf ever found in the world,” said Grant Zazula, a local palaeontologist working with the Yukon government, who also emphasised the support of the local gold miners and mining community for palaeontology research.Julie Meachen, a carnivore morphologist who works with ice age mammals at Des Moines University and will soon be doing research on the wolf pup, said: “When Grant sent me the pictures and asked me to participate I was really, really excited. I was sort of beside myself.“We want to do an ancient DNA test to see who it’s related to and look at its microbiome to see if there are gut bacteria still there.”Other researchers around the world reacted with similar excitement to the discovery of this ancient predator and its prey, which are well enough preserved to allow for future investigation of factors such as cause of death, diet, health, age and genetics.Elsa Panciroli, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Ice age wolf bones are relatively common in the Yukon, but having an animal preserved with skin and fur is just exceptional – you just want to reach out and stroke it. It’s an evocative glimpse into the ice age world.”Thomas Higham, an expert in archaeological dating at the University of Oxford, said: “The remains are highly evocative because they enable us to make almost face-to-face connection with animals that are tens of thousands of years old, and yet look much more recent.”The wolf and caribou are believed to have inhabited a dry tundra landscape alongside other animals such as woolly mammoths.The preservation of the skin and fur suggests they were living in a cold period, said Jan Zalasiewicz, a palaeobiologist at the University of Leicester. “A drier and more arid climate would help to preserve skin and fur, and this typically happens when the climate gets colder,” he said. “The trick here is finding a means of freeze-drying the carcass in these arid conditions and burying it … you need to find a way to dry it and put it in the freezer very quickly.”Panciroli said: “Hopefully further research on this ‘pup-sicle’ might yield some ancient DNA” that could provide new information about the wolf populations that lived in the Yukon at this time. “For example, where did they come from, and how are they related to modern wolves?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f4c3889f57a0c7f098ca17be6ef1173a11ac57/0_0_2585_1551/master/2585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02bdbb2a419b40b7609d5b1398462667","title":"birmingham beyond the blade podcast","story":"In our second episode, we travel to Birmingham and hear from a group of parents about the role of fear in driving incidents of violent crime.

In his absence from what will almost certainly be the last Cup fixture in the city of his birth in a long time they reserved their appreciation for the triumph of Dan Evans on his return from an enforced sabbatical, then were stunned by the five-set defeat of Cameron Norrie, a still unfamiliar son of a Glaswegian emigre.“I’m very proud to represent my country and win,” Evans said after a gruelling 7-6 (4), 4-6, 0-6, 6-4, 7-5 win over Denis Istomin in four hours and 11 minutes, the perfect start to Great Britain’s World Group play-off against Uzbekistan on Friday.Norrie, the team’s world No70 and No1 active player, whose father arrived from New Zealand two days previously, had an altogether trickier time against the world No 434, Jurabek Karimov, who recovered from two sets and a break down in the third, saving match point in the tiebreak, to win 0-6, 5-7, 7-6 (6), 6-2, 6-2.As the 20-year-old Uzbek shed his early serving nerves, he began to hit with abandon and wit. Norrie, meanwhile, did not faintly resemble the player who announced his arrival in Davis Cup in February by coming from two sets down to beat the clay specialist Roberto Bautista Agut in Spain.Norrie was candid in defeat. “Honestly, at the end of day, he played too good. All credit to him. It was tough for me to find a clear way to win. I competed as hard as I could and couldn’t ask any more of myself. I’ll try to forget that as soon as possible but it hurts a lot because I’m not just playing for myself, I’m playing for the team.”Much now depends on the doubles , when Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot should restore the lead against Istomin and Sanjar Fayziev, as well as how Norrie recovers in the reverse singles against Istomin on Sunday.With characteristic understatement Evans said of his own intense struggle with 32-year-old Istomin, who has won 48 Davis Cup matches for Uzbekistan, “It’s good to get a win against a top-60 guy.‘ For the Birmingham maverick, it was more than just a mood-setting win in a Davis Cup tie victory represented another stage of his redemption.Elaborating on sentiments he expressed on his return in April from a one-year drugs ban – down the road in a leisure centre in Scotstoun – Evans described his lonely purdah. “You’re just so far away from the world you’re used to. That’s the hardest part. I had to live a pretty boring, sheltered life, No real existence or importance. I didn’t do much. I just had to play second fiddle. I didn’t have anything to do because I couldn’t play tennis.”But he is back now – still short of his pre-ban best, he concedes, but finding his feet, at times stroking fine winners, from chips and lobs to single-handed backhands that kissed the lines. He sliced more than he bashed, which kept Istomin off-balance on the baseline, though he too contributed to the entertainment with a welter of quality ground strokes, saving five match points before Evans sealed the rubber.What mattered most was the reception he got from a smaller than usual but equally noisy gathering. There was little dissension about his performance. Of the hardcore fans who occupied 4,715 of the 6,529 available seats, there was near-unanimous approval .Victory for the world’s fifth-ranked team will enhance their seeding when the competition is decided for the first time in a best-of-18 round robin in Lille or Madrid. The Davis Cup has sacrificed home-and-away romance for a World-Cup style format intended to lure the biggest stars back from more lucrative endeavours in a packed schedule.Murray is not among the abstainers. He is 3,200 miles away across the Atlantic working on his recovering hip. In a video message on the stadium’s screen he said, “I’m very sorry I can’t be there to support the team and I will be watching here in Philadelphia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f788a58ddcfe493d145ee58b93ea43a00b175614/308_41_3192_1915/master/3192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=441ad38c3824945479a755a4c1bc7732","title":"gloucester bristol premiership match report","story":"Unbeaten Gloucester clambered to the top of the Premiership after coming from behind to defeat promoted Bristol who made a point even if they returned home without one. The Bears were ultimately undone by their own adventure, conceding two late tries after abortive attacks from their own line, but they had far more about them than most newly promoted sides.They led 13-3 at half-time having reduced Gloucester to desperation in attack. Even Danny Cipriani struggled to find doors to unlock, but Bristol’s pressing game is complemented by pushing the boundaries at the breakdown where they bravely contest the ball aggressively in a league that gives the benefit of law-breaking doubt to the attacking side.Bristol were fortunate not to receive a yellow card in the opening half after conceding four in as many minutes, but after Gloucester had scored a try 45 seconds into the second period through the second row Gerbrandt Grobler after taking the direct route, George Smith was sent to the sin-bin for killing the ball on his own line.By the time he returned to the field, Charlie Sharples had scored two tries, both from lineouts that followed penalties. Cipriani had by then remembered where he had left his baton, orchestrating moves with his range of passes to stretch the defence and extort more penalties from the most indisciplined team in the Premiership so far this season.Gloucester are unlikely to do more than babysit the top position with Saracens and Exeter in action on Saturday and they travel to Sarries next weekend. They were unsettled initially by Bristol’s anarchic approach, suckered into playing behind the gainline and constricted for width, but after the interval they stormed the advantage line, Jake Polledri to the fore, and gave Cipriani the means to dictate.It was Cipriani’s opposite number, Ian Madigan, who provided the highlight of the opening half after he had exchanged penalties with Billy Twelvetrees. The Irish international’s chip on halfway was gathered by Steve Luatua who promptly offloaded to Luke Morahan to neutralise three defenders.It was the one time spontaneity resulted in a try for Bristol, but three other opportunities were only lacking a final pass. If their adventure at times bordered on recklessness – Gloucester’s final two tries, scored by Ed Slater and Matt Banahan, came after Bristol had lost the ball near their own line – it will yield greater reward when the team settles down.Bristol have used 28 players as starters in the opening three rounds of the season in contrast to Gloucester who have only made four changes. Their head coach Pat Lam is targeting home fixtures, but discipline is an issue that needs addressing though, with the 18-10 penalty count a significant factor in their defeat.“We gave them easy ways out,” said Lam. “We have to look at ourselves and be honest.” Bristol failed to score in the second half and lost the scent of a losing bonus point when Twelvetrees, whose partnership with Cipriani is maturing, kicked a penalty to make it 30-13, but they will take some watching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85735f3976989aa1f84d77751558e854a3fb2659/319_61_4559_2735/master/4559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdc2c73107091225507fabdd93432ed1","title":"somerset vitality blast unsung counties","story":"Edgbaston will be full for a Finals Day that promises to show some of the game’s less heralded sides at their Twenty20 bestSurrey have already been crowned county champions, England have wrapped up a Test series victory over India and the football season is back in full flow. Now, three weeks after the Vitality Blast’s quarter-finals, Somerset, the Worcestershire Rapids, Lancashire Lightning and the Sussex Sharks descend on Birmingham on Saturday for Finals Day.Despite this year’s announcement about the contentious new 100-ball tournament from 2020, the Blast has drawn a record aggregate attendance of 931,000 to matches. The season’s distended scheduling might mean that some key overseas signings are unavailable on Saturday but the Blast, once the poor relation of Twenty20 leagues such as the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash, has turned itself into something of a success story. This year Edgbaston announced before the competition had even begun that it had sold out its 24,550 capacity for Finals Day.The quality of cricket has been lauded too. By the end of this year’s league stage, the Blast’s overall run rate was 8.88 runs per over not only is this the best scoring rate in the history of the tournament but also compared to any other domestic Twenty20 league globally.In a two-fingered salute to the structural tinkering, the day also features some of the less fashionable counties. Of the four teams present only one, Lancashire, are based at a ground that has been announced as a base for a new franchise team in the proposed 100-ball tournament. The other semi-finalists are instead counties who have built up almost cult-like followings through their Twenty20 campaigns.Somerset embody this in particular their opening batsman Johann Myburgh, who plays exclusively white-ball cricket for the county and announced his retirement at the end of the season, was given a standing ovation at Somerset’s final home match. In four seasons the South African has become what many thought was an oxymoron: the popular Kolpak.The gruelling schedule of Finals Day, in which two semi-finals are followed by the final later in the evening, has always made things unpredictable, something the shorter format lends itself to anyway. Predicting the outcome on this occasion however feels particularly tumultuous because, despite the Blast being the fastest scoring competition in the world, in three of this year’s quarter-finals the side batting first misread conditions on slower pitches. The spin attacks in particular have proved a huge asset to all four sides.The Sussex captain, Luke Wright, believes the left-arm spinner Danny Briggs is an underestimated quantity, moreover, his performances to date overshadowed by the much vaunted pace trio of Tymal Mills, Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan.Somerset, who face Sussex, inch in as favourites, their deep batting lineup and potent mixture of seam and spin producing a nicely balanced side. Not only did Somerset finish the league stage with the most points, they knocked out last year’s winner, Nottinghamshire, along the way.Worcestershire, alongside Derbyshire, are one of two counties never to have featured in a Finals Day, so they go into today with plenty to learn and little to lose and much to gain. So enthralled are they to have got this far that Joe Leach, their injured captain, has packed his kit in preparation for a “full-kit John Terry” appearance should his teammates win the trophy.And Daryl Mitchell, asked if he had the choice between surviving relegation in the County Championship (currently unlikely) and winning the Blast, opted for the latter. Test cricket showed this summer that it still has the capacity to captivate an audience perhaps domestic Twenty20 can too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24925642763554fc960ce5542af0389a3a9b29a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99b5203b19f9839823c5dd51c72fc932","title":"vuelta a espana simon yates british cycling grand slam","story":"The journey towards British domination of world cycling that began in Barcelona in the summer of 1992, when Chris Boardman claimed an Olympic gold medal, is likely to climax in Madrid on Sunday if Simon Yates completes a British grand slam of European road racing’s grand tours.Assuming he survives Saturday’s final mountain stage of the 2018 Vuelta a España in Andorra, Yates will become the first of Bury’s chosen two — he races alongside his twin brother Adam — to win one of cycling’s grand tours.Yates closing on a first grand tour victory — and the fact that he does not ride for Team Sky — is remarkable enough. What is even more astounding is that his success would achieve an unprecedented clean sweep by three different British riders in the 2018 season.Yates would follow Chris Froome in Italy and Geraint Thomas in France, should he win in Spain. It will also be the fifth consecutive grand tour win by a Briton, a sequence that began over a year ago with Froome’s win in the 2017 Tour de France.With two stages remaining the usual caveats apply – not to mention the Giro d’Italia, the Grand Tour in May, in which Yates seemed set fair for victory only to “do a Devon Loch”, collapsing on the\u0026nbspmountain climbs only 48 hours\u0026nbspfrom victory to finish a mere also-ran in Rome.The swashbuckling, devil-may-care style that after years of calculated racing by others proved so refreshing, but ultimately so fatiguing, in Italy, has not been evident in Spain.Instead Yates has bided his time and, like his brother Adam, seems to have conserved his energy as much as possible.As the Vuelta reaches its climax, the Spanish media is talking of a “four-legged Yates”, with the twins leaning on each other in the final mountain stages to ensure Simon’s final success. “He’s my secret weapon,” the race leader said of his brother this week.Yates’s success has been almost a decade in the making. As an 18-year-old in 2010, he joined the British Cycling Academy and won a world junior track title. Stage wins in the 2011 and 2013 Tour de l’Avenir, a proving ground for young talent, stole the eye, as did a stage win in the 2013 Tour of Britain.His Tour de France debut came in 2014 and by the following year he was finishing in the top 10 of Alpine races such as the Tour de Romandie and Critérium du Dauphiné. In March 2016 he failed a drug test and served a four-month ban for a “non-intentional” doping violation after his defence\u0026nbspof an\u0026nbspadministrative error was\u0026nbspaccepted.Twenty-five years ago the prospect of a Briton contending for overall victory in a grand tour was a fantasy. “It was laughable,” Brian Cookson, the former president of British Cycling and UCI president, told the . Cookson, who became president of British Cycling in 1997, remembers first noticing the Yates twins racing at the Manchester Velodrome. “The Yateses, particularly Simon, are absolutely a product of the system. If the velodrome hadn’t existed they\u0026nbspwould not have been recruited into the sport. I’m absolutely sure of that.”Cookson agrees that Boardman’s gold medal at the Barcelona Olympic Games was something of an epiphany for a federation which in the early 1990s had only a handful of active members.“There’s a number of ground zeros but Boardman’s gold in Barcelona began to convince people that we could become world class,” he said.There were other significant hurdles, such as the radical changes\u0026nbspto the structure and governance of the British Cycling Federation in 1996 and a brutal overhaul of the federation’s ailing finances, which Cookson says were in “a parlous state”.“To secure lottery funding we had to persuade UK Sport that British Cycling was a safe pair of hands,” Cookson said, “and to fulfil the desire to transform the membership as we went from 14,000 members to 100,000 members.“People laughed at the idea of British success in cycling and now it has happened. Yes, British Cycling has taken a bit of stick recently, but what we are seeing now is the proof that the process and the structure was right. OK, Chris Froome’s a bit of an outlier but the development of British talent has been very much built on a structured process. It’s all bearing fruit now.”Before Dave Brailsford’s appointment as British Cycling’s performance director the nation had claimed only one Olympic gold — Boardman’s — in 40 years. Unsurprisingly, Brailsford and Boardman became integral to the Olympic medal hauls in Athens and Beijing – which led on to\u0026nbspthe founding of Team Sky in 2009 –\u0026nbspand then London, fuelled by Brailsford’s ambition in the post-Lance Armstrong era, to move into road racing and win the\u0026nbspTour de France with a “clean” rider.It took Team Sky three years to win the Tour and they have dominated grand tour racing since, taking six Tours de France, a\u0026nbspVuelta a España, a Giro d’Italia and countless other European stage\u0026nbspraces.That dominance has fuelled unprecedented scrutiny, manic trolling on social media and the unwanted nickname “UK Postal” – an unflattering reference to Armstrong’s former sponsor, US Postal Service.At the climax of last week’s Tour\u0026nbspof Britain in London, few among the thousands lining the streets of London’s West End seemed to\u0026nbsphave any misgivings. Team Sky held sway and drew huge crowds of fans and well-wishers, unbothered by the cynicism towards the team.Away from the selfie-hunters and bodyguards, the peloton journeyman Alex Dowsett, once of Team Sky but now riding for Katusha\u0026nbspAlpecin, was able to give perspective to the cultural and sporting revolution in British cycling. The Essex-born rider, a veteran of the European scene, says that the Tour of Britain attracted the “biggest crowds” of\u0026nbspany of the non-grand tour races.\u0026nbsp“On a lot of days the Tour of Britain does compete with grand tours and has Tour de France-esque crowds,” the Giro d’Italia stage winner said.“I think British cycling will continue on an upward trajectory,” the 29-year-old continued. “That’s because a lot of it comes down to the nation embracing cycling as a mode\u0026nbspof transport, not just as sport.“If a hundred more people start using bikes then one or two might turn to racing. Thousands of\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspare getting on to bikes instead of using cars or public transport, and now there’s also phenomenal talent\u0026nbspcoming through in the junior ranks.“If I was a British junior racer now\u0026nbspI think I’d have a much harder time making it as a pro than I did because of the talent there. The pool is so much bigger now. The junior Tour of Wales for example – when I was younger would just about get a full field and include some teams from overseas.“Now they could run it two, maybe three times over, just with young British talent. That’s a massive change. When I was young there were just a couple of us.”So much of the change is cultural, fuelled, as concerns over health and\u0026nbspthe environment grow, by a renewed enthusiasm for the simplicity of the bicycle but also by\u0026nbspthe hip and discreet styling that\u0026nbsphas been led by British clothing\u0026nbspbrands, such as Rapha, bought last year by Walmart, and David Millar’s CHPT3.The commercial growth of British cycling style – a combination of sharp design and clever marketing rooted in a chic retro style – has also fuelled the growing sense of superiority and swagger. At the top of cycling’s sports marketing pyramid sit Team Sky, a wealthy and dominant franchise that despite all the brickbats and criticisms, rule their sport.A younger Simon Yates was courted by Team Sky but opted to progress his career elsewhere. “It seems that young riders kind of get stalled there because of the hierarchy of Sky,” he said in 2013. “It’s hard for a young rider to get established. It was best for me to sort\u0026nbspof break out and try something new. I do not want to get caught up in that web.”This is professional cycling, a sport shadowed by the past and suspicious of consistent success. Scepticism and suspicion hovers in the background, whether it relates to Froome’s salbutamol controversy, Lizzie Armitstead’s missed tests, Simon Yates’s four-month ban or the allegations of “unethical” practices laid at Brailsford’s door by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee report into anti-doping in March.Victory in Madrid would complete\u0026nbspa remarkable journey, both for Simon Yates and British cycling as a whole, but like those before him this is a success that will be thoroughly and endlessly scrutinised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5953f1db7e83e26688b0ec84f7ebd257f6a8330f/0_104_3400_2041/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f04fd9033d8511d3d6cab6afa415174e","title":"moeen ali i was called osama by australia player during 2015 ashes","story":"England all-rounder Moeen Ali claims he was subjected to a racial taunt from an unnamed Australian player during the first Test of the 2015 Ashes series.Ali, who scored 77 and took five wickets in what was his first Ashes match, said in his autobiography which is being serialised by The Times that he was likened to the Islamic terrorist Osama bin Laden on the pitch at Cardiff.“It was a great first Ashes Test in terms of my personal performance,” Moeen writes in the book. “However there was one incident which had distracted me. An Australian player had turned to me on the field\u0026nbspand said, ‘Take that, Osama’.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I could\u0026nbspnot believe what I had heard. I\u0026nbsp remember going really red. I have\u0026nbspnever been so angry on a cricket field.”Moeen, a British-born Muslim, claims he spoke to his England coach, Trevor Bayliss, about the slur, who raised it with the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann.Lehmann then sought an explanation from the player, who denied making the comment. “Lehmann asked the player, ‘Did you call Moeen ‘Osama’?’ He denied it, saying, “No, I said, ‘Take that, you part-timer.’“I must say I was amused when I heard that for there is a world of difference between the words ‘Osama’ and ‘part-timer’,” Moeen writes. “Although I couldn’t have mistaken ‘part-timer’ for ‘Osama’, obviously I had to take the player’s word for it, though for the rest of the match I was angry.”Moeen said the player approached him at the end of the series, at which point he denied making the comment and claimed “some of my best friends are Muslim”.“I did not argue with him,” writes Moeen. “But I was so clear that is what he said. Why should I invent it out of the blue? I’ve got nothing against him. I have never had any fights with him before. I did not even know the guy. And I thought his denial was a standard response.” Earlier this week, Moeen told The Times he had no sympathy for Australia’s banned cricketers and that he finds the whole team “rude”.\u0026nbspAustralian cricket was thrown into turmoil earlier this year when captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft were banned after a ball-tampering scandal during a Test in South Africa.\u0026nbspMuch of the cricketing world reacted with a mix of anger and schadenfreude, with media pundits and former players suggesting Australia had brought themselves undone with the aggressive way they played the game.\u0026nbsp“Everyone you speak to ... they are the only team I’ve played against my whole life that I’ve actually disliked,” Moeen told The Times.\u0026nbspMoeen, who had a terrible 2017-18 Ashes in Australia but returned to form to help England beat India 4-1 in the recent test series, said he felt no sympathy for Smith, Warner and Bancroft.\u0026nbsp“I’m someone who generally feels sorry for people when things go wrong but its difficult to feel sorry for them,” he said.\u0026nbsp“The first game I ever played against them, in Sydney, just before the 2015 World Cup, they were not just going hard at you, they were almost abusing you.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cbe4ef3ad2c5d6a63978fb6524d0875ab24b6b4/480_696_3684_2210/master/3684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa69cd2f5f29b65b4835fd370036fa2c","title":"natalia osipova pure dance review","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonThe ballet superstar plots a course from classic to modern with six pieces that evoke eeriness, desolation and giddy joyMuch is made these days of ballet dancers being flexible. Not ankles-up-by-your-ears flexible – although that helps – but stylistically flexible. You train for years moulding your body to fit classical ballet’s narrow prescription, then spend the rest of your dancing life breaking out of it. Many dancers try contemporary rep, but Natalia Osipova is rare in pursuing concurrent careers at the top of world-leading ballet companies (Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre) and as her own artistic director, commissioning new work.The test is whether Osipova can convincingly shed her ballerina’s skin to inhabit these contemporary worlds. Across this evening of six works – four new commissions, one UK premiere and one “heritage” piece – the answer has to be yes: Osipova’s dancing looks freer and more expansive than I’ve seen it before.Pure Dance reunites Osipova with her favourite partner, David Hallberg, and he is a refined presence in Antony Tudor’s The Leaves Are Fading, from 1975. In fact these leaves are swirling, as if kicked up on the breeze, moving in continuous circles like the ribbon of a rhythmic gymnast. Coy half-smiles and sweet memories play on Osipova’s face as they dance with an oh-so-delicate touch.Part of becoming a chameleonic dancer is choosing great people to learn from. In Iván Pérez’s new work Flutter, it’s the brilliant Jonathan Goddard, a dancer whose seemingly boneless body takes on a joyous levity.Osipova can’t match Goddard’s utter naturalness but there’s great pleasure as the pair come repeatedly rushing forward to the edge of the stage, with giddy faces, in a manner that can only be described as gambolling.It’s in Roy Assaf’s Six Years Later (2011), dancing with Jason Kittelberger, that Osipova departs farthest from familiar turf. A mildly unnerving piece that manages to make Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata seem deeply eerie, it gives us a worn-in and perhaps worn-out relationship two people who know each other so well they fall together into dextrous phrases, perfectly in tune. Their slightly hunched bodies lean on and support each other, but they’re also frustrated, needling, Osipova batting her lover’s body with her shoulders in a futile argument that no one is winning.The depressing realism of this romantic cul-de-sac makes Alexei Ratmansky’s Valse Triste, a more balletic take on the rollercoaster of a relationship, look stagey by comparison – but it’s an interesting conjunction.Osipova ends with a solo, Ave Maria (set to Schubert) by the Japanese choreographer Yuka Oishi. The choice of music is almost trite, Osipova plays up to its emotion with full commitment, her panoply of facial expressions played to the back rows. There’s something about Osipova here reminiscent of a very different artist, the flamenco dancer Rocío Molina – the improvisatory feel, the awkward angles segueing into scrolling grace, the stubborn drive of her dancing.Like Molina, Osipova is seeking modes of expression beyond her classical roots, and proving herself a very 21st-century dancer. She is fully in control of her career, as well as her versatile dancing body."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3e801cf0fb4f474e94e843873d062ea7b34884/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24cba8264948cd8593d361e43026f336","title":"a discovery of witches sky1 matthew goode","story":"Oxford is overrun with vampires and witches in Sky1’s new potion, which blends ingredients from Harry Potter, Being Human and Inspector Morse Matthew Goode is standing on a bridge in Oxford at sunrise on the autumn equinox, looking out over the shimmering river. “We creatures have all but disappeared,” he says to himself. “Demons, vampires and witches, hiding in plain sight, fearful of discovery, ill at ease even with each other.”His character, Matthew Clairmont, is a geneticist by day, but he’s a vampire – you wait. And this woman sculling under the bridge, blue-eyed visiting history of science research fellow Diana Bishop (Teresa Palmer) is a witch, even if she doesn’t look like one.Most of the creatures seem to be hiding in Oxford. Inspector Morse? Almost certainly a vampire. That lot on University Challenge? Witch, witch, vampire, witch. They like it there, with the spires and the Bodleian Library.The Bodleian is the other star here, as it was in several Harry Potter movies and episodes of Morse. Diana unearths an ancient alchemy book that causes all sorts of weird stuff to happen. She’s a reluctant witch as well as a rowing one – she just wants to get on with academia and rowing and drinking beer, but the emergence of this manuscript, missing for hundreds of years and sought by many, means she can no longer ignore her powers. Will she and Matthew now put aside their witch-vampire illness of ease in order to get to the bottom of whatever it is that needs getting to the bottom of?Meanwhile, a run-over doctor cannot be brought back to life by his friend, another Oxford vampire. (See? It’s crawling with them!) And over in Finland, a man is encircled in a ring of fire and sucked into the Earth by a witch who looks anything but reluctant.

But what does he make of the current investigation into Donald Trump?Last Christmas Eve, Ken Starr took his family to a cosy restaurant in New York’s West Village. They had finished their meal and were leaving for a carol service when he spotted in the foyer a dark-haired woman who looked familiar.“She bears a remarkable resemblance to Monica,” he thought, recalling the White House intern who had been the focal point of the special investigation he spearheaded as independent prosecutor two decades ago, which culminated in the impeachment of a US president. Then the penny dropped: it was her.Remarkably, until that moment, Starr had never met Monica Lewinsky, the woman he put on the rack in 1998 as he tried to extract evidence from her about her tryst with Bill Clinton. According to Lewinsky’s account of the awkward encounter, she managed to stammer to Starr that she wished they had both made different choices back then, as a gentle way of inviting him to say sorry to her. But he made no move to apologise that night. The two exchanged pleasantries and went their separate ways.Now, nine months later, Starr, 72, has a second chance to set things right with Lewinsky. We are discussing Contempt, his new memoir of the Clinton investigation, when I put the question to him: “Do you owe Monica Lewinsky an apology?”I choose my words carefully, repeating verbatim the question NBC News posed to Clinton in June. Outrage ensued when the former president blurted: “No, I do not.” Starr’s response to the same question is identical, surprisingly so given that the two men were arch-enemies. “No,” he tells me, adding the non-apology: “I regret the sorrow she went through, the travail she went through.”It is 20 years this week since the Starr report was published, tearing a massive rip in the political fabric and leading to only the second impeachment of a US president in history. The report, and the 11 charges against Clinton that went with it, propelled Starr into international notoriety as the Republican scourge out to get a popular Democratic leader. He was dubbed, as he recalls in the book, “the most criticised man in America”. Halloween masks were cast of him.So it’s with some trepidation that I welcome this fearsome figure into the  offices in New York. When he arrives, wielding a large umbrella and generous smile, he comes across as startlingly harmless. He is wearing a pinstripe suit and baseball cap, a clash of styles that presumably passes as normal in his home state of Texas, but gives him the avuncular air of a small-town bank manager.When we sit down, I remind Starr that what he did on 16 January 1998, in an operation dubbed “Prom Night”, was anything but harmless. He arranged for Lewinsky to be hustled by a group of male officers to a hotel room where she was threatened with 27 years in prison – three more years than her age at the time – unless she wore a wire and snitched on Clinton. All because she had lied about her affair with the president in a civil lawsuit.Starr went on to reveal her most intimate details, semen-stained blue dress and all, to the entire planet. He turned her life, as she put it, into a “living hell”.“We gave her the opportunity at the Ritz Carlton hotel in very pleasant circumstances to cooperate with the investigation and she chose not to,” he says. “It was a very unwise decision.”It was bullying, I say.“I completely reject the suggestion there was bullying. We were clear and emphatic: you’ve engaged in very serious misconduct, do you want to cooperate or not?”It’s uncanny how the Starr phenomenon is back in the headlines 20 years later. It’s not just the publication of his book, a thinly disguised justification for his hounding of the Clintons over the Lewinsky affair and in the earlier investigation into an obscure Arkansas land deal called Whitewater.It’s also that #MeToo has brought the affair of the president and the intern in the Oval Office back into view as the mother of all gender-related workplace abuses. Then there’s the fact that the White House incumbent is once again in the sights of a special prosecutor – for Ken Starr 1998, read Robert Mueller 2018.Several lead characters have made a comeback, from Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential bid down. Brett Kavanaugh, who was a key member of Starr’s team in the Clinton investigation, is on the verge of being confirmed to a supreme court seat that would lock in rightwing control of the nation’s highest court for generations. Rod Rosenstein, another core Starr investigator, is the justice department official overseeing Mueller’s e into possible collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.“There are eerie echoes of the past,” Starr says. “The years go by yet many of the characters are back on stage, and some of the issues – presidential accountability, rule of law – have re-emerged.”So what tips would Starr have for Mueller? “My advice would be what I told my team every day: ‘Let’s just get this job done as quickly and professionally as we can. We are being very closely watched.’”Mueller appears so far to have avoided traps that befell Starr. Mueller is discreet, focused, ruthlessly effective – adjectives rarely attached to his predecessor in the Clinton days. Could it be that Mueller studied and learned from his mistakes?Starr thinks so. He shudders as he recalls giving a couple of high-profile media interviews to disastrous effect. ABC’s Diane Sawyer snarkily wondered on live TV whether she had the right to ask him if he had cheated on his wife (he said he hadn’t).By contrast Mueller has kept schtum. “He’s got into a submarine and gone deep and silent into the depths of the investigation,” Starr says. “I have no doubt he is mindful of the past and trying to avoid landmines.”As for Trump, Starr says he is struck by the “overwhelming distinctions” between the president and Clinton in their responses to their respective investigations. He tells me that, from what he has seen, Trump “has not engaged in obstruction of justice and has been cooperating, whereas the Clintons did everything they could to be obstructive”.That’s a bold statement given Trump’s firing of the FBI director James Comey and the increasingly bizarre attacks on Mueller by Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.You could equally turn the observation back on Starr: there appears to be an overwhelming distinction in the standards he applied to Bill Clinton and those he now applies to Trump. In the 1990s he showed Clinton no mercy – pursuing him relentlessly over five years: from Whitewater, to Vince Foster’s suicide, “travelgate”, “filegate”, “troopergate” and finally Lewinsky.In the end, it came to nothing. His team discussed charging Hillary Clinton but concluded they lacked proof. After Bill Clinton was impeached, in February 1999 he was acquitted on all counts by the US senate.Starr also gives Trump the benefit of the doubt on perjury, saying: “To my knowledge, he has not lied under oath.” That’s a telling comment, given what he did to Clinton.At the point when Lewinsky was grabbed by Starr’s men on Prom Night, Clinton had not yet lied under oath. It was only the following day, after Clinton, ignorant of what had just happened, was deposed in the Paula Jones lawsuit that he perjured himself by lying about the relationship. That sounds to me like entrapment, I say. Why didn’t Starr simply pick up the phone and call the White House to ask what was going on with Lewinsky rather than allow the president to hang himself?“Because we had seen this pattern of conduct before,” Starr says. “We felt he had been completely untruthful with us, deliberately so.”There are two ways of looking at Starr’s contrasting approaches to Trump and Clinton – Trump innocent until proven guilty, Clinton guilty as hell so let’s find the evidence to prove it. You could say he’s just being a lawyer, or you could say the disparity leaves an acrid, partisan taste in the mouth.It’s precisely that taste that is making Democrats so anxious about Kavanaugh as he gets close to being confirmed to the supreme court. Kavanaugh was the lead writer of the 11 counts of impeachment against Clinton, a task he undertook with alacrity. Yet since 1998 Kavanaugh has changed his spots, increasingly favouring strong executive power in the face of prosecutorial challenges. That has prompted speculation that he might go easy on Trump and allow him to avoid subpoena in the Russia investigation.Should we be worried? “I think everyone should rest easy,” Starr says. “Brett Kavanaugh is a lawyer’s lawyer, a judge’s judge.”During Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, a 1998 memo he had written for Starr surfaced in which he sketched out questions to ask Clinton about Lewinsky before the grand jury. In it Kavanaugh castigated the president for his “callous and disgusting” behaviour, then posed questions that can only be described as, well, callous and disgusting.Which brings us back to Lewinsky and the publication of the Starr report 20 years ago. When it was released by Congress on 11 September 1998, the US’s collective jaw dropped from all the lurid detail it contained. Rereading it today, you can see why. There’s the famous cigar reference, and precise accounting of how many times Lewinsky reached orgasm and when the president of the United States did or did not ejaculate. The document reeks of what Sawyer in that same ABC interview called “demented pornography for puritans”.I was surprised that a lifelong evangelical Christian such as Starr would resort to such language, and I ask if he regrets it.“I very much regret that Congress decided to release the report, we had not anticipated that. But we had to prove the case, the president had lied under oath.”Weren’t you being prurient?“No, that’s an unfair, unjust charge. We were prosecutors, we had to prove our case. Of course it was ugly. The president was warned that this would be embarrassing, then he was found in contempt because of his willing mendacity.”The Starr report marked a crucial juncture in the postwar journey of the US, from the God-fearing family-oriented 1950s to the present day, when a man can boast about grabbing women by the pussy and still get elected president. Does he think that by dwelling so graphically on private sexual matters he contributed to this coarsening of public discourse?For the first, and only, time in our hour together, Starr concedes. “I don’t think it was helpful in terms of public discourse, of course,” he says.“I don’t think it was helpful.” It’s not the apology Lewinsky wants. But coming from the man whose name was once a byword for partisan intransigence, perhaps it’s a start.Contempt: A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation by Ken Starr (£23.99, Penguin Random House) is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c71ac73c4a185b3e4818e65e15baa8c46b1a1a9f/1594_0_2656_1595/master/2656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c29d1ad0fe1f472cca79450387e18b5","title":"brexit worries from the irish border a panoramic photo essay","story":"Amid the growing tensions over Brexit and the border, photojournalist Charles McQuillan met people whose work takes them across the frontier. Many expressed fears about the future and the possible return of old isionsCharles McQuillan, a freelance photographer with the news agency Getty Images, used a panoramic film camera to shoot these images. He then built a darkroom in his garage to process the films. He says: “The most problematic issue with photographing the border is that there is nothing there to photograph. With that as a starting point, the basic concept for the picture essay was to show that uninterrupted space, and to include people who have a direct relationship with the border. And, more broadly, to show them in the landscape with the expanse of the open countryside around them and their place in it. The nothingness of it.“One of the privileges that comes with being a photographer is that it allows you access to people you would not necessarily meet, and it was difficult not to be moved by Betty, Eamonn, John, Brian, Emma, Johnny, Vincent, William and Catriona as I listened to their concerns about Brexit. Each of the subjects photographed were grateful for being allowed a voice, something many people in the province feel they no longer have.“My own memories of the border and the checkpoints are somewhat distant, but I can recall sitting on the back seat of my mother and father’s car wondering whether the raised hand of the guard would either beckon onwards or to stop. The mundaneness of the various checkpoints across the north, the armed soldier with his weapon trained on the car, all seem to have merged into one memory now. When stopped at the border, the question to my father was always the same: ‘Where are you coming from, sir, and where are you going?’ I can’t remember my father ever declaring anything.”Catriona attends nearby St Mary’s college in Derry. Her journey to and from school threads through the border.She says: “Ireland’s economy cannot afford to make the border anything more than it already is today – an invisible line that separates the country. At most, we will have checkpoints which will take a great step back into the past of Northern Ireland. My biggest fear is that it will damage my future education through travelling to university, affecting my pathway of study.”Farmer and landowner, Florence CourtThe popular boardwalk on the farmer’s land allows thousands of tourists to walk across the border every year as it meanders between County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland.A member of the Border Communities Against Brexit group, Sheridan predicts the UK will lose much of its wealth and status after Brexit. He says: “There is no such thing as a soft border. Over time, it will become a hard border by layer upon layer of legislation. The only practical solution I can see is to have the border in the Irish Sea.”Vice-chair of Newry Chamber of Commerce and TradeMarmion, who has two young children, owns a human resources business with offices and employees in Newry in the north and Dundalk in the south. She recalls recently explaining to her eldest child, while they were riding their bikes, that she was unable to use the road they were cycling on when she was young because of concrete blockades placed there by the British army. She says she has no idea what the border will look like after Brexit. “That’s the scary part – nobody knows. My greatest hope is that it would be ision-less and prosperous, not just for business and trade but for the navigation of everyday life.”When asked what concerns her most, Marmion says: “That the border would look like it did when I was growing up: restrictive and fearsome. Absent of both the freedom of movement and unlocked opportunity that my children deserve – and that I have enjoyed since 1998.”McKeegan crosses the border several times a week as he attends to the recently deceased from both sides of the frontier. He says: “If the politicians were children you would give them a smack and tell them to get their heads together to sort it out. There’s no reason in the world that they can’t come to some common-sense agreement. In relation to my sensitive line of work, can you imagine waiting in a queue at the border with family sitting in cars behind you as you carry their loved ones home? It’s undignified. You just can’t close the border off with a brick wall and red tape.”Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care, which is based in the Republic of Ireland but has access to nearby health facilities in the north. Without access to the new radiotherapy unit in Derry, which the Irish government invested in, cancer patients in Donegal face a five-hour journey to Galway.When asked what she thinks the border will look like post-Brexit, Holmes says: “There will be a serious ision of people who have lived and worked closely together for many peaceful years. Long queues, angry people, loss of jobs, missed appointments, flights and a younger generation who can’t understand why. They will now bere introduced to a time when hate and bigotry were rife and the possible return of paramilitaries. My greatest fear after Brexit is the serious loss of access to cancer services for Donegal patients at Altnagelvin Area hospital in Derry. Without these patients, the North West Cancer Centre will not have the critical mass to sustain the services needed for cancer patients in Derry and the surrounding areas.”McKevitt recalls how, in his youth, IRA snipers would shoot at the customs post from the hills, pictured behind him. He was sent by his parents to the US to avoid getting caught up in the violence that engulfed the province. His fireworks, gardening and fuel business sits on the land the former customs post used to occupy.He says he has many concerns about Brexit. “My greatest fear is of the government taking my land away with the return of the customs post. I’ve built up all of this and worked hard, what would I do then?”As a business owner whose oyster farm straddles both sides of the border, Lynch will be particularly affected after Brexit. He faces tariffs to ship his oysters outside of the UK to nearby Donegal, and indeed the rest of the Europe. He says: “I worry that we will return to the bad old days. I remember the border growing up as a child quite vividly, and I remember the two customs posts sat only a few yards apart from each other, and that you couldn’t cross the border after 10pm without special written permission from the guards.” To further complicate matters, the UK government claims jurisdiction over Lough Foyle to the high-tide mark, while the Irish government disputes this.Clifford, who lives in the Republic of Ireland, owns a fast food stand that trades along the border to lorry drivers transporting goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.He says: “I don’t know what’s going to happen after Brexit, no one does. My biggest fear is that I will lose my job, my livelihood, everything – and that, at the finish of it, the Troubles will come back.”Kilkeel is home to Northern Ireland’s largest fishing fleet. Cunningham is concerned that could soon change. He says: “My biggest fear is displacement of fishing effort. We traditionally fished in the bay of Dundalk, a few miles along the coast, but we’ll no longer be allowed in there. It’s a disaster for the inshore fishing fleet.“There are 40 small boats in Kilkeel harbour that seek shelter through the winter from the prevailing south-west winds. When Brexit happens, where will they go? Small boats exposed 12 miles out to sea, that’s life or death stuff. That’s not bullshit, that’s reality.”McQuillan says: “The portraits could have been shot digitally and much more simply with a wide-angle lens. However, the perspective would have become warped. Whereas a panoramic camera avoids curvature if positioned correctly, offers less distortion and is much truer to the eye with its even horizon and straight lines. Shooting film again for the first time in almost 20 years would also give the photographs a different look and feel to modern digital cameras, with the colours saturated and borrowed from a different time. However, the film came at a premium, with the size of the panoramic negative only permitting four exposures per roll.“The panoramic cameras, a Fuji GX617 and a Noblex u150, brought unique challenges. Focus could only be accurately accomplished with the aid of a tape measure. Flash could not be synced to the Noblex because of its rotating drum lens. To further complicate matters, fingers placed incorrectly when holding the camera would fall into frame if not careful.

You can read our news story here, check out our interactive storm tracker here, and tell us about your experience of Florence here.Thanks for reading.The Associated Press has this report about the polluted sites that may lie in the path of the stormAs Tropical Storm Florence spins inland, environmental regulators are monitoring more than three dozen toxic waste sites in the storm’s path, as well as scores of low-lying water- and sewage-treatment plants at risk of flooding.EPA spokesman John Konkus said the agency is listening for any word of oil or hazardous substance spills from first responders, media reports and state and local emergency command posts. He said federal on-scene coordinators and equipment stand ready to deploy if needed.The Environmental Protection Agency has identified 41 Superfund sites in threatened parts of the Carolinas, Virginia and Maryland and Georgia. Superfund sites are among the nation’s most highly polluted places. They often contain contaminated soil and toxic waste at risk of spreading if covered by floodwaters. No toxic spills had been reported as of Friday afternoon, but the region’s rivers were not expected to crest for days. Forecasters predicted severe flooding for parts of southeastern North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina starting Sunday.Among the Superfund sites most at risk from Florence is Horton Iron and Metal, a former shipbreaking operation and fertiliser manufacturing site in a low-lying floodplain along the Cape Fear River outside Wilmington, North Carolina. The 7.4-acre (3-hectare) site is heavily contaminated with pesticides, asbestos, toxic metals and cancer-causing PCBs.In future disasters, US citizens may receive messages on their phones directly from Donald Trump, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) begins its testing of a system that allows the president to send a message to most US mobile phones.Next Thursday, Fema will conduct its first nationwide test of the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a system allowing a text message to be sent to mobile phones with warnings about dangerous weather, missing children or other critical situations.During the test, people will receive a text with a header that reads “Presidential Alert” and text that says: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”More than 100 mobile carriers, including all the major wireless firms, are participating in the roll-out.Of course, those people who follow President Trump on Twitter already get messages from the president straight to their phones, but unlike with Twitter, people are unable to opt out of receiving these alerts. The WEA system was approved by Congress in 2015. Legislation surrounding the law warns that the “system shall not be used to transmit a message that does not relate to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety.”It is unclear how much personal input the president will have in the crafting of the alerts and whether they will be written in his characteristic style.Residents of western North Carolina have been warned they could see flooding and landslides from Saturday night through to Monday, as rain continues as a result of the storm.A 72-hour rainfall forecast for the state from 8pm Friday through to 8pm Monday, shows heavy rainfall and strong winds that could have “life-threatening impacts”.Emergency Management North Carolina say these conditions will slowly improve, though did not say whether the improvement would begin without that 72-hour period, or after its conclusion.There are now more than 773,000 reported cases of power outages across North Carolina, according to the North Carolina department of public safety. The highest concentration of which are New Hanover, Brunswick, Wake, Onslow, Carteret, Pender, Robeson, and Wayne countiesThe department of safety also have a great interactive map showing where evacuation orders are in place in different counties and a list of shelters.The National Weather Service have issued an update on the storm. The storm is moving slowly west-southwest over the east of South Carolina and storm surges, wind and rain were expected to continue overnight.As of 11pm local time (about half an hour ago) the storm was about 15 miles (20km) west-northwest of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and about 45 miles (70km) south-east of Florence, South Carolina.Florence had maximum sustained winds of 65mph (100 kmh) and was moving west-southwest at a rate of 5 mph (7kmh).The advisory notice said “life-threatening storm surges and strong winds” were set to continue overnight and “catastrophic freshwater flooding” was expected over portions of North and South Carolina.Nasa have published this extraordinary video of the landfall of Hurricane Florence, as seen from the International Space Station.Various agencies are tweeting safety warnings and advice, which we’ve collated here. The list is by no means exhaustive so feel free to tweet me if you see more, but they include:Donald Trump has doubled down on his claim that 3,000 people did not die in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria.Trump is on Twitter complaining about claims that the death toll exceeded 3,000 people in Puerto Rico. On Thursday he said that number had been made up by the Democratic party “to make me look as bad as possible”. Here’s what he’s been tweeting tonight:This issue is clearly exercising the president, who also tweeted about it earlier in the evening, including quoting Fox News presenter Lou Dobbs calling the government of Puerto Rico “one of the most corrupt governments in our country”.This row kicked off earlier in the week, when Trump called the federal response last year in Puerto Rico an “incredible, unsung success” in comments from the White House on Tuesday.His remarks sparked outrage, including from Senate minority leader Charles Schumer, who called Trump’s comment “offensive, hurtful and blatantly false” and Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan who told CNN the comments were: “a stain on his presidency. He says he’s done a good job when 3,000 people have died?”There’s more on that story here:The Wall Street Journal is reporting that as Hurricane Florence was bearing down on North and South Carolina, the Trump administration was considering replacing the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The WSJ says FEMA administrator Brock Long is the subject of an internal investigation after allegations he misused resources traveling to his home in North Carolina and that the White House had been discussing potential replacements.Donald Trump has repeatedly praised FEMA for their response to Florence, including just a few minutes ago when he tweeted: “America is proud of you. Keep it all going – finish strong!”Some people are sharing photographs highlighting the incongruity between the beauty that exists (and indeed, is caused) by Florence in areas on the edges of the storm’s path and the devastation it is wreaking on towns that are feeling the full force of the storm.Lauren Visin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service calls the the storm a “monster” but says in her area, where she says Florence is due to hit tomorrow, it has been preceded in her area by striking cloud formations.Jeff Dauler, a radio presenter in Atlanta Georgia, is in upstate South Carolina and comments that it is “remarkable how terrible storms are surrounded by such beauty”.A question we have been discussing in the newsroom, which comes up frequently in reporting natural disasters like this one, is: can you still call Hurricane Florence, “Hurricane Florence” when it has been downgraded to a tropical storm?Let me know what you think on Twitter, but our current thinking for this blog is:This is Kate Lyons, back with you again. I’m taking over the blog from Sam Levin as we continue our rolling coverage of Florence. If you have any news tips or questions you’d like us to address on the live blog, get in touch, I can be reached via kate.lyons@the and on Twitter @mskatelyonsThe National Weather Service Eastern Region have shared rainfall reports for towns across New Carolina (and a few in South Carolina), they warn that rain is continuing to fall heavily across the two states and these totals may be much higher by morning.A few scenes from a hotel in Wilmington where  reporter Khushbu Shah is spending time with evacuees:Authorities have confirmed five deaths linked to Florence so far:Climate scientist Michael Mann has published a comment piece in the  about the “climate change triple threat” posed by Florence: An early autumn ocean “heat wave” has brought sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic to bathtub-level warmth. Just as summer heat waves on land are greatly increased in frequency and intensity by even modest overall warming, so too are these ocean heat waves becoming more frequent and more extreme as the oceans continue warm. All else being equal, warmer oceans mean more energy to intensify tropical storms and hurricanes. But when it comes to coastal threat, it hardly matters how many tropical storms there are over the course of the season. A single landfalling hurricane can wreak havoc and destruction. Think Katrina in 2005, Irene in 2011, Sandy in 2012, either Harvey or Maria in 2017 and now Florence in 2018.In this sense, the sometimes fractious debate about whether we’ll see more or fewer storms in a warmer world is somewhat misplaced. What matters is that there is a consensus we’ll see stronger and worse flood-producing storms – and, in fact, we’re seeing them already. That brings us to Hurricane Florence: a climatologically-amplified triple threat.There is a new flash flood emergency warning for Goldsboro, Smithfield, Selma, Princeton and other municipalities in North Carolina. Avoid walking or driving through flood waters."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3629652.1536946440!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sleeping disorders rising in line with obesity epidemic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSleep apnoea and snoring were once thought to be “disorders of middle-aged men”, but  latest research suggests snoring affects half of adult men, while sleep apnoea affects a quarter. Photograph: iStockSleeping disorders such as sleep apnoea and snoring are rising dramatically in line with an obesity epidemic globally, according to a world-leading sleep expert, Prof Peter Cistulli.Meanwhile, nearly a fifth of couples worldwide are forced to sleep apart because one partner snores, or gets interrupted sleep, he told The  in Dublin.Sleep apnoea and snoring were once thought to be “disorders of middle-aged men”, but the latest research suggests that snoring affects half of adult men, while sleep apnoea affects a quarter.Increasingly, both are being linked to chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and dementia and possibly even cancer, noted Prof Cistulli, a Sydney-based respiratory medicine consultant.“In some ways, sleep apnoea could be a missing link in our understanding of lots of chronic diseases that was previously unrecognised, or under-recognised – that is feeding into the development of these diseases.”Speaking before a major medical and dental conference on new treatments for sleep disorders, Prof Cistulli warned that Ireland is now leading the European obesity league.Questioning the Irish health system’s ability to cope, Prof Cistulli said people must wait a year to see a sleep clinician at St Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin, with up to a further year before a sleep test is done.“That is way too long,” he said, “the fact that sleep has survived evolution across all species tells us that it plays an absolute fundamental role in survival, in health and wellbeing.”Sleep has become the “new frontier” in medicine because of the impact of modern life on people, while light and noise is increasingly affecting sleep patterns and quality of life, he added.The most important sleep disorders are breathing difficulties associated with snoring and sleep apnoea (when breathing stops for periods in the course of a night’s sleep).Meanwhile, there is insomnia, or the disruption to the “body clock” associated with shift work and restless legs syndrome – where patients have constantly twitchy legs at night.In sleep apnoea, intermittent breathing pauses can lead to critical drops in oxygen, which prompts people to awaken once the throat “re-opens” and oxygen levels are restored, but the cycle then repeats.Progress was made in the 1980s with the arrival of “a strange contraption” known as a CPAP which required a mask to be glued to the nose which worked like “a reverse vacuum cleaner”.Nearly 40 years later, the continuous positive airway pressure device is still the number one treatment but it is cumbersome, and many chose not to use it because of discomfort.Currently, researchers are exploring dental solutions, including a customised model fitted by specially-trained dentists that realigns the lower jaw and creates more space for continuous night-time breathing.“It is a beautifully simple solution that is more appealing to patients,” he said, adding that it works for 70 per cent of patients, while 90 per cent of patients and partners say it cuts snoring.Currently, such devices cost about €1,200, but Prof Cistulli hoped that advances in digital scanning technology in taking dental impressions and 3D printing would cuts costs.Doctors and patients must become more aware of the solutions that now lie beyond CPAP “breathing machines”, he said, adding that he hoped the conference organised by Irish Society of Dental Sleep Medicine would help.Snoring is often the butt of jokes, but it can be a signal that sleep apnoea is developing, while some research suggests that it could disrupt blood flows to the neck and raise the risk of stroke.Regular snorers who feel tired during the day should be checked by doctors, and those who suffer “breathing pauses” should be checked by doctors, especially if they have chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes.Meanwhile, he urged people affected to lose weight, avoid alcohol and some prescription drugs, or to consider trying to sleep in different positions. Surgery at the back of the mouth can help, but it is invasive."},{"url":null,"title":"housing activists stage sit down on luas tracks in dublin city centre","story":"  September 13, 2018Balaclava-wearing garda\u0026iacute helping remove protesters only inflames an already tense situation   September 13, 2018Notice says if the protesters fail to leave the property, the owner would seek an injunction   September 13, 2018Protesters clash with garda\u0026iacute as men in balaclavas eject group from city centre property "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3629655.1536946768!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps call for ban on irish fishing vessels after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Court ruled in October 2016 that the so-called Voisinage Agreement, an informal arrangement dating from the 1960s and limited to small fishing vessels, had to be provided for in legislation if it was to continue.  Photograph: Chris FurlongGetty ImagesIrish fishing vessels should be excluded from UK waters as soon as Britain leaves the European Union next March unless the Government resolves a dispute over fishing rights, a committee of MPs has recommended. In a report on fisheries after Brexit, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee says Ireland’s unilateral suspension of a mutual fishing rights deal was causing hardship to fishermen in Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court ruled in October 2016 that the so-called Voisinage Agreement, an informal arrangement dating from the 1960s and limited to small fishing vessels, had to be provided for in legislation if it was to continue. The Government introduced a bill to address the issue but its passage through the Oireachtas was delayed after fishing groups warned that its wording could allow large British vessels to fish in Irish waters.“We are disappointed that the Voisinage Arrangement has been unilaterally suspended in Ireland. While Irish fishermen have access to waters in Northern Ireland, fishermen in Northern Ireland have suffered hardship through exclusion from their habitual fishing grounds. This needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency,” the committee’s report says.“We recommend the Government structures talks with the Irish Government to establish the future of reciprocal access for Northern Irish vessels under the Voisinage Arrangement. “If the Irish Government does not give a clear commitment to pass, within six months of publication of this report, legislation which restores reciprocal access, the Government must discontinue access to UK waters for Irish vessels from March 30th, 2019. “If the Irish Government does pass legislation to reinstate the Voisinage Arrangement, then the UK Government should consider whether the arrangement should also be put on statutory footing in UK law.”The report also calls for an early resolution to the dispute between the British and Irish governments over the delimitation of maritime borders in cross-Border Loughs Foyle and Carlingford.

Photograph: EPA We are delighted to kick off this new political season with news of a happy ending, a global picture exclusive and a plea from the Tánaiste requesting people to stop offering him cats.Readers may recall a heartwarming story of youthful enterprise surfacing after the papal visit, when Simon Coveney revealed he had to bribe his youngest daughter with the promise of a kitten after her last-minute refusal to greet the pope at Dublin Airport.Emergency negotiations opened on the tarmac as Annalise (5), displaying a flair for the art of brinksmanship, declared she was too tired and cold to take part in the carefully choreographed welcoming ceremony with her sisters Beth (9) and Jessica (7). The Minister for Foreign Affairs tried to change her mind with the opening offer of a slap-up meal. This was rejected, along with a follow-up offer of access to his phone for a month. Annalise correctly pointed out that she would take the phone anyway.An outright offer of his iPad was similarly spurned, so Coveney played the ace card.“I’ll get you a kitten.”Shrewd Annalise nailed down the deal before committing to anything.And, just in the nick of time, the Coveney girls greeted Pope Francis in Italian, Spanish and English and Annalise presented a bouquet of flowers. Everything went swimmingly.As soon as the story appeared, the Minister was showered with offers of kittens. In the past three weeks, staff in his Dublin and Cork offices have been fielding emails and calls from all over the country. However, the search is already over. In the week following the Papal visit, Simon made good on his promise. The payback puddy has fallen on his feet and is now being spoiled rotten by three besotted girls in Carrigaline.He is a cheeky one-eared kitten from Blackrock in Cork who climbed into a warm car engine for a snooze and nearly died when the engine was turned on. But his cries saved him and he was nursed back to health – minus his ear – by a local animal rescue volunteer.The Coveney bribery cat was to have been named Francis, but in a nod to both the pope and the kitten’s bravery, he will henceforth be known as Spirit.All bright as buttons this week at the Fianna Fáil think-in. Ready for the parliamentary session to come and putting up a determined – if slightly unsteady – show of faith in the continuance of their confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.One of the more entertaining aspects of the event was the polite jockeying for position between the two senior figures in the host constituency of Fingal, where TD Darragh O’Brien and Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee hold sway. During the public media pieces, party leader Micheál Martin exerted the gravitational pull of a small planet on his two north Dublin representatives, who couldn’t seem to break free from closely orbiting him whenever he ventured outside.Clifford-Lee, who is party spokeswoman on Justice, Equality and Children, has her sights set firmly on a Dáil seat and O’Brien, who holds the high-profile housing portfolio, would, of course, be delighted if the party could deliver two seats in the next election.During his after-dinner speech in Malahide’s Grand Hotel on Tuesday night, Micheál made a point of thanking the duo for hosting such an excellent gathering and remarked upon their impressive unity of purpose.Parliamentary party members seemed to find this most highly amusing.Clifford-Lee also had her posters up on lampposts around the hotel welcoming party colleagues to her area. She followed up with goody-bags for everyone. The contents included a “hot chocolate swirl” from Ashbourne-based chocolatier Chez Emily and a packet of crisps from North Co Dublin purveyor Keoghs.We hear there was an enjoyable but restrained evening of collegiate bonding afterwards in the bar, topped off by some with a gallop to Gibneys licensed premises for last orders. The other big event on in the Grand’s conference centre on the night was the “8th Baltic Meeting on Microbial Carbohydrates”. Which must have been a blast.However, the big social event of the week was on Thursday night when the Taoiseach hosted a lavish Fine Gael fundraiser in the Castleknock Hotel in his Dublin West constituency. The ballroom looked stunning for the event, with candelabras on the tables and black sashes on the white-draped chairs.It was a modest affair. Oh, just €200 a plate. As you do. It was fully subscribed – all very low key, no big FG names throwing shapes – with 300 guests tucking into the meal and devouring Leo’s every word afterwards.That’s a handy 60k for the election coffers. Not, the Taoiseach keeps insisting, that there is one in the offing. If his TDs and Senators are also busy with fundraisers, that just in the normal run of things. Josepha Madigan is hosting a big do in Dublin-Rathdown in a couple of weeks and the following night it’s Senator Catherine Noone’s turn. She’s holding a fundraiser in Clontarf Castle, now that she is joining Richard Bruton on the ticket in Dublin Bay North.Luke “Ming” Flanagan didn’t mince his words on Tuesday when delivering a blistering attack on Hungary’s ultra-conservative PM Viktor Orban during the European Parliament’s debate on disciplining his country for repeated breaches of the rule of law and hostility to migrants.Party leaders described Orban as “the most corrupt leader in Europe” and a “neo-fascist in bed with Putin”, but Ming appears to have upset the delicate sensibilities of his colleagues by calling him “a piece of dirt”. The following day a number of MEPs demanded that he be censured for unparliamentary language. The parliament’s bureau is now considering the issue.Ming, MEP for the Midlands-North West constituency, was incensed at the mere sight of the controversial Hungarian leader, and he let fly from the start. “Mr Orban, I am no fan of the European Union, but I have to say you completely and utterly disgust me . . .”Unfortunately, English speaking correspondents missed Ming’s opening salvo due to a malfunction in the interpreters’ booth.Instead of relaying Flanagan’s passionate defence of migrants – instancing his own family’s experience – the parliament’s TV system continued with the feed from the English-language booth, even though the interpreters were off-duty and chatting among themselves.“Oh, God, he’s something else, isn’t he?” said one voice.“I think he’s all right,” said another.The MEP later tweeted that his office was trying to establish why the live stream cut out for some of his speech. “Probably Putin up to his tricks,” he added.At the end of his contribution, Ming repeated what he said at the beginning – once more, with feeling. Orban, who was in the Strasbourg hemicycle (chamber), winced at his words.“I’ll say it again. Don’t like the European Union, but as far as I’m concerned: You. Are. DIRT.”There was a big reaction to his contribution.On Thursday, Ming tweeted again: “Apparently I’m now in the pockets of both Putin and Soros. They must be wearing the same pair of trousers.”Tom McLoughlin remembers his very first job as an officer in the Government Information Service.He thought it was the most marvellous gig ever: a trip to his beloved Croke Park for the launch of the newly revamped stadium and a special blessing ceremony for the upgraded Hill 16.“March 14th, 2005. I’ll never forget it. The taoiseach Bertie Ahern and GAA president Seán Kelly were there for the rededication of the Hill,” recalls Tom. “I didn’t know then that it would take another 6½ years for the blessing to kick in and for Dublin to win the All-Ireland.”Nearly 14 years and four taoisigh later, “Big Tom” is moving on. A familiar face around Government Buildings and Leinster House and at official State occasions, he will be missed by his colleagues in the GIS, the many politicians he kept a protective eye on and the countless journalists he has tried to mind, keep in line or let down gently (not always successfully).Tom’s last major gig – he’s a very tall man – was overseeing GIS arrangements for the recent Papal mass in the Phoenix Park. It was a huge logistical operation and it passed without a hitch.He lists the historic visit of Queen Elizabeth to Ireland in 2011 and US president Barack Obama’s visit here in the same year among the highlights of his time in the GIS. Accompanying Taoiseach Enda Kenny to Flanders last year for the special commemoration of the first World War Battle of Messines also stands out.“Do you know who my favourite taoiseach was? Whoever was taoiseach when the question was asked,” he says, in true civil service fashion.Outside Merrion Street, one of Tom’s proudest achievements is having one of his poems published in the centenary programme for the National Football League final in Croke Park in 2016.And neatly bookending his long spell dealing with grumpy media types (he’s relocating to Denis Naughten’s department to work on energy policy) was his last official assignment two weeks ago, in Croke Park.“After the match, I had to walk the Taoiseach over to the RTÉ Roadcaster to do an interview with Marty Morrissey after Dublin did the four in a row. I was very happy about that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane florence waves batter north carolina coast","story":"  September 14, 2018Fears of \u0026lsquocatastrophic\u0026rsquo flooding as streets left inundated with ocean water on east coast   September 14, 2018Gusts of up to 144kmh reported with up to 127cm of rain expected in North Carolina   September 15, 2018Forecasters say 560km-wide storm could leave much of the Carolinas under water "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

That was until a genealogist promised his grandmother he would solve the mystery before he died. Now a millionaire landowner has been announced as the chief of Clan Buchanan which has been without a head since 1681 after the 15th chief John Buchanan died, leaving no male heir or arrangements for his title to be passed on.John Michael Baillie-Hamilton Buchanan, 60, who owns Cambusmore Estate near Callander, has been accepted as head of the clan thanks to the work of genealogist Hugh Peskett.The 85-year-old, who famously traced President Ronald Reagan’s Irish ancestry in the 1980s, became a genealogist 50 years ago after his grandmother who was a Buchanan clanswoman herself urged him to find the rightful chief.Decades of genealogical work has allowed Mr Baillie-Hamilton Buchanan, now known as The Buchanan, to verify the claim of chief. The Buchanan with The Lady Buchanan and their son BruceThe Buchanan has believed for most of his life that he was the rightful chief as a descendant of Francis Buchanan of Arnprior, who was executed for high treason for his role in the 1745 Jacobite uprising and named by Sir Walter Scott as the true Buchanan leader.The Lord Lyon King of Arms, the head of Lyon Court which regulates Scottish heraldry, has now formally upheld his bid to become chief. “We first approached the Lyon Court informally over 20 years ago and it has taken decades of genealogical research to back up our claim,” said The Buchanan. “I am honoured and proud that my claim to the chiefship of Clan Buchanan has been upheld by Lord Lyon.“Hugh Peskett has tracked down more than 12 chiefs and this is certainly very special for him because of his own family links.”The Buchanan first discovered that he could be chief after he was told of his family links by his father. Whilst he had never made a claim for the title, The Buchanan decided it was something he was keen to investigate.With his identity now proven Mr Peskett said: “As a clansman of the Clan Buchanan, it was absolutely fascinating to delve into the history and ancestry of one of the oldest clans in Scotland. My research took decades to compile and unequivocally confirms the chiefship claim. “This is a historic moment for Clan Buchanan and I am truly privileged to have played my part. I believe my grandmother would be incredibly proud of what we have achieved.”The famous genealogist has traced many a rightful heir to Scottish clans. In 2003 a London banker ousted a farmer from his role as clan chief to the Oliphant family thanks to the work of Mr Peskett.David Byrne, president of Clan Buchanan Society International, said: “This is a day many of us believed would never happen in our lifetime so it is a time to celebrate for our members.“It has always been the goal of our Society since 1970 to keep the traditions of our clan alive in hopes that one day a chief would be named. Today we can proudly share that mission with The Buchanan for the first time in 337 years.”Clan Buchanan can be traced back to 1010 AD in Scotland, however it now has millions of members across Europe, North America, Africa and Australia.George Lauder McAusland, commissioner for Scotland and the UK of the Clan Buchanan International Society, added: “Clan Buchanan has members worldwide and having a chief for the first time in over 300 years will be an exciting time and a great opportunity to promote our great Clan to even greater heights.”Carrie Hope Fletcher on bullies, body image and bringing Heathers to the West EndComment: These extremely innocent Russians aren’t the first tourists to be smeared by BritainAggressive goats, with taste for human urine, are airlifted out of parkComment: It\u0026#39s a triumph of the radical Left that only the Dalai Lama is now allowed to speak \u0026#34the truth\u0026#34Share your Spitfire memories for The \u0026#39s celebratory project Quick silver: The life and times of one very special Spitfire Mark IX Around the world in a Silver Spitfire: meet the magnificent men flying a classic warplane to new heightsSuper Typhoon Mangkhut slams into the Philippines, millions in its pathHurricane Florence: Mother and child among five killed as violent storm batters US east coast\u0026#39Fed up\u0026#39 teenager, 17, murdered stepmother with a samurai swordAustralians told to chop strawberries as police investigate needles found in fruitSenior officer faces action for saying \u0026#39whiter than white\u0026#39Prince Harry: I panic at the sight of my grandmother Kate Moss regrets \u0026#39nothing tastes as good as skinny feels\u0026#39 line Tony Blair quoted film depiction of Diana\u0026#39s death for memoirs, Oscar-winning writer claimsCoffee shops are as unhealthy as fast food chains, says chief nutritionistComment: Corbyn makes Gordon Brown look like Scrooge.

The baby’s father was taken to hospital.Elsewhere in the storm-ravaged state a man died plugging in a power cord, another man was killed as he checked on his hunting dogs, and a woman  died from a heart attack after rescuers were unable to reach her home past downed trees.More than 60 people had to be rescued in another town as a cinderblock motel collapsed at the height of the storm\u0027s fury.On Friday night the 400-mile wide tempest had knocked out power to three quarters of a million homes and businesses, and left many people stranded in their flooded homes.Earlier the eye of the hurricane made landfall at Wrightsville Beach, just outside Wilmington, on Friday morning, with winds of over 100mph, then stalled and began crawling inland at just 3mph.It was expected to drop eight months worth of rain in just a few days on North Carolina as residents prepared for a deluge some were calling “the great soak”.A total of 10 trillion gallons - the equivalent of 15 million Olympic-sized swimming pools- - was expected to fall on North Carolina alone. Around 18 trillion gallons was predicted to fall on the whole US east coast.On Friday night, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Florence has weakened to a tropical storm, adding that still life-threatening storm surges and catastrophic freshwater flooding are expected over portions of North and South Carolina.Roy Cooper, North Carolina’s governor, said it was a “thousand year rain event” that would “continue its violent grind for days.He added: “We\u0027re deeply concerned for whole communities which could be wiped away.” Ralph Evangelous, the Wilmington police chief, added: “I see a biblical proportion flood event, pretty epic in nature.”Storm tracker: Follow path of Hurricane FlorenceSome 1.7 million people had been told to evacuate but many stayed.About 20,000 took refuge in shelters at schools, others moved into hotels. In the town of Jacksonville, North Carolina 70 people, including families with pets, were rescued after The Triangle Motor Inn motel began crumbling and parts of its roof came off.At the Carolinian Inn in Wilmington owner Laxman Odedra, 65, a British citizen who moved from Berkshire 23 years ago, surveyed the impact on his motel.The floor to ceiling window in the lobby was blown out and a 40ft pine tree toppled with a crash during the night, trapping cars in the car park. “We don’t know what the eventual damage is yet, it’s still going on,” he told The .Hurricane Florence: Panic buying and empty shelves as US residents prepare - in picturesA large tree also fell on the Indochine Thai restaurant nextdoor, crushing a roof. Tim Samples, 32, fled his home two blocks away, along with his wife and three daughters, to shelter at the Carolinian Inn.“This is the worst storm I’ve ever seen,” he said. “I don’t know if my house is OK. I can’t get back there at the moment. Fingers crossed.”Streets in Wilmington, which usually has a population of 100,000, were deserted. Its suburban areas became a maze of roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. One tree fell on Kevin DiLoreto’s home.“It\u0027s insane. I\u0027ve never seen tree devastation this bad,” he said.The White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump had spoken to state and local officials, assuring them the federal government was prepared to help.He planned a visit to the region next week, said a spokesman, once his presence would not interfere with rescue efforts.The spokesman added that the White House stood ready and prepared to assist with anything needed by the affected areas.Donald Trump is briefed on Hurricane Florence Wilmington sits on the already swollen Cape Fear River which was not expected to crest for several days.The town of New Bern, 90 miles up the coast from Wilmington, saw its centre submerged as the River Neuse quickly burst its banks following a 10ft storm surge.Residents rescued 350 neighbours using boats but many more were still stranded.They were also being helped by the Cajun Navy, a group of Louisiana-based hurricane volunteers. They have become a feature of recent storms, using their own boats to mount rescue operations.In a tweet New Bern officials told those stranded to “move up to the second floor, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU”.A local TV station in the town had to evacuate its own newsroom as it was broadcasting details of the hurricane.Volunteers from the Civilian Crisis Response Team help rescue three children from their flooded home in James City, United StatesGeorge Zaytoun, one of those who had decided not to evacuate New Bern, said: It\u0027s like a bomb has gone off. Everything around us is underwater.In Bayboro, North Carolina, Kim Dunncalled In to ABC News to say she was trapped in her truck as waters rose. Some 9,700 members of the National Guard have been deployed to the area with helicopters and boats. People walk through floodwaters caused by Hurricane Florence in downtown New Bern, North CarolinaIn Wilmington some of those who did not evacuate said they had not believed the warnings. On Thursday night several dozen of them gathered in the Barbary Coast, the only bar to stay open, on the banks of the Cape Fear River.“About 70 per cent of people I know evacuated,” said patron Tom Bruin, 32, as a television broadcast dire warnings. “I’m not sure I believe the hype.

This could mean\u0026nbspthat inflation would be in danger of getting out of hand without early rate rises, particularly if sterling plummeted again, pushing up domestic import prices.At that briefing, the governor also pointed to the results of last year’s banking stress tests that were judged by the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee of regulators to include the worst case scenario from a no-deal Brexit. This included a 33 per cent decline in house prices, relative to otherwise, over three years.It also modelled the impact of a rise in interest rates to 4 per cent.That would significantly increase the pressure on mortgage borrowers and raise the cost of finance for business borrowers.Interest rates currently stand at 0.75 per cent, the highest since the financial crisis, after the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\u0026nbspraised them again in August.Financial markets are currently expecting just one further hike by the end of next year.A rise in rates to 3 per cent would add about £300 to the monthly repayments of someone with a £200,000 25-year repayment mortgage.The government’s own internal\u0026nbspforecasts suggest a long-term hit to the UK economy of failing to conclude a free-trade deal with the EU amounting to 8\u0026nbspper cent of GDP. That implies a fall in productivity growth capacity due to weaker trade with the largest and nearest commercial partners.But many analysts warn the industrial and travel chaos likely to be unleashed by a no-deal scenario would also hit short-term demand, risking a recession –\u0026nbspsomething that would ordinarily prompt a rate cut by a central bank.The decision to raise or cut rates after a chaotic Brexit would not be made by Mr Carney alone – it is the nine-person MPC\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspwould decide. But the governor’s view is generally held to hold significant sway in its meetings.Mr Carney had been due to step down at the Bank of England in June 2019.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”Amal\u0026nbspClooney\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspGeoffrey Robertson over the Elgin Marbles (Getty)The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”AFPGetty)Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens.

This could mean\u0026nbspthat inflation would be in danger of getting out of hand without early rate rises, particularly if sterling plummeted again, pushing up domestic import prices.At that briefing, the governor also pointed to the results of last year’s banking stress tests that were judged by the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee of regulators to include the worst case scenario from a no-deal Brexit. This included a 33 per cent decline in house prices, relative to otherwise, over three years.It also modelled the impact of a rise in interest rates to 4 per cent.That would significantly increase the pressure on mortgage borrowers and raise the cost of finance for business borrowers.Interest rates currently stand at 0.75 per cent, the highest since the financial crisis, after the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\u0026nbspraised them again in August.Financial markets are currently expecting just one further hike by the end of next year.A rise in rates to 3 per cent would add about £300 to the monthly repayments of someone with a £200,000 25-year repayment mortgage.The government’s own internal\u0026nbspforecasts suggest a long-term hit to the UK economy of failing to conclude a free-trade deal with the EU amounting to 8\u0026nbspper cent of GDP. That implies a fall in productivity growth capacity due to weaker trade with the largest and nearest commercial partners.But many analysts warn the industrial and travel chaos likely to be unleashed by a no-deal scenario would also hit short-term demand, risking a recession –\u0026nbspsomething that would ordinarily prompt a rate cut by a central bank.The decision to raise or cut rates after a chaotic Brexit would not be made by Mr Carney alone – it is the nine-person MPC\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspwould decide. But the governor’s view is generally held to hold significant sway in its meetings.Mr Carney had been due to step down at the Bank of England in June 2019. But he has now accepted an invitation from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to extend his term until 2020 to help steward the economy through the aftermath of Brexit.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/31/16/ISSgulfmexico.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3682066  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Earth from the ISS  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/31/16/ISSgulfmexico.jpg","title":"alien conspiracy sunspot observatory new mexico fbi shutdown blackhawk","story":"Created with Sketch.Solar facility was swooped on by FBI in helicopters who evacuated it – and nothing has been heard sinceClick to followThe IndependentNasa releases trailer for space exploration mission Parker Solar ProbeSpace observatory at centre of alien conspiracy asks for ‘patience’ after evacuation by the FBIA space observatory at the centre of swirling alien conspiracy theories has asked for “patience” as it continues to be locked down.The Sunspot Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico caught the attention of the world when it was shut down by FBI agents who reportedly swooped on the facility after arriving in elite Blackhawk helicopters.It led immediately to suggestions\u0026nbspthe advanced technology inside of the facility spotted something it shouldn’t – such as proof of extraterrestrials,\u0026nbspUFOs or even some baseless speculation that the observatory had spotted that the sun has started dying.

And the lockdown continues with no new information.Now, the observatory itself has spoken out to thank people for their patience. But it didn’t reveal any more about what is actually going on.The National Solar Observatory, which manages the facility, gave an update on Facebook that was shared on the observatory’s own page.“AURA – our management organisation – is addressing a security issue at Sunspot Observatory at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico and has decided to temporarily vacate the facility as a precautionary measure,” the NSO said.That post was\u0026nbspresponded to\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspa flurry of comments from followers who asked why the NSO\u0026nbspwas continuing to keep the facts secret.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.The researchers examined 22 sites across Devon and Cornwall, and found a boundary that runs roughly from the Exe estuary in the east to the town of Camelford in the west.Rock samples from these ancient sites were taken back to the lab and subjected to intense chemical analysis to understand their past. The scientists published their findings in the journal Nature Communications.In more recent history, Britain was connected by a land bridge to mainland Europe that allowed humans and animals to migrate between the regions, but the new discovery shows an even deeper connection.“We always knew that around 10,000 years ago you would have been able to walk from England to France,” Dr Dijkstra added.\u0026nbsp“But our findings show that millions of years before that, the bonds between the two countries would have been even stronger.\u0026nbsp“It explains the immense mineral wealth of southwest England, which had previously been something of a mystery, and provides a fascinating new insight into the geological history of the UK.”This area\u0026nbspcontains an abundance of valuable metals like tin and tungsten. These metals are also found in Brittany and other parts of mainland Europe, but are not common throughout the rest of the UK.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/14/11/breaking.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/14/11/breaking.jpg","title":"jacob reesmogg hard brexit group questioned by parliamentary authorities over funding","story":"Created with Sketch.Emails released by the parliamentary standards watchdog show the European Research Group has a second bank accountClick to followIndy PoliticsRelated video: Jacob Rees-Mogg protesters tell Brexiteer\u0027s children that \u0027lots of people hate your daddy\u0027Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit group questioned by parliamentary authorities over fundingA group of hardline Brexiteers, led by\u0026nbspConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, has been questioned by a parliamentary watchdog over funding concerns as it emerged the group had a second bank account.It comes after reports earlier this week suggested the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory MPs held a meeting in which some members spoke about the need to topple Theresa May and her Chequers plan for Brexit.Correspondence between the ERG and the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), obtained by the news website Open Democracy, show how the watchdog challenged the ERG over its use of funding in support of a hard Brexit.Theresa May has finally outmaneuvered the hard BrexiteersBrexit wasn\u0027t caused by austerity, and here\u0027s the proofTheresa May should ‘seal deal with Brexit and then stand down\u0027Wetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for hard BrexitThe group has received thousands of pounds from taxpayers, via MPs’ expenses, to fund its research but strict rules set out by Ipsa dictate how the money should be used.The emails also reveal how the secretive group, whose 80-strong membership is not publicised, has a “second” bank account for entertainment purposes and “occasional functions”.In one email from June, an Ipsa\u0026nbsprepresentative said: “Essentially the basis of concerns raised with us is the assertion that Ipsa funding is being used to support pro-Brexit campaigning activity.“I think I’m correct in saying that the ERG has other sources of funding, which presumably can be used for campaigning or party political activity if you so choose. That said, I would be grateful for a further conversation with you about how this separation is maintained.The scheme states that activities for which MPs use funding provided by Ipsa must not be party political, including anything that advocates\u0026nbspfor or against a party.In response to one email, the ERG said: “We don’t as a research group do political campaigning. The MPs separately are politicians.“We have two bank accounts. One Ipsa\u0026nbspand one not. The non-Ipsa one pays for occasional functions, MPs’ breakfasts, drinks etc. That’s it really.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUK news in picturesAn early Banksy mural has been accidentally painted over during renovations.

The discount pub chain said like-for-like sales went up 5 per cent in the year to 29 July, while revenue rose 2 per cent to £1.69bn, and pre-tax profit increased by 4.3 per cent to £107m.Tim Martin, the group’s chairman, used the results statement to reiterate his support for a hard Brexit. “There will be a huge gain for business and consumers if the UK copies the free trade approach of countries like Singapore, Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Israel, by slashing protectionist EU import taxes (‘tariffs’), on leaving the EU in March next year,” he said. “If parliament votes to end tariffs and rejects the Chequers deal, consumers and business will benefit additionally by avoiding a cost of £39bn, or £60m per UK constituency, in respect of the EU orce payment\u0026nbsp– for which there is no legal obligation.“Unfortunately, some iniduals, businesses and business organisations have mistakenly, or misleadingly, repeated the myth that food prices will rise without a deal\u0026nbspwith the EU. “In fact, the only way prices can rise post-Brexit is if parliament votes to impose tariffs. The EU will have no say in the matter, provided that the government does not sign away the UK’s rights in a deal\u0026nbspin the meantime.”Will Wetherspoons really only sell British booze post-Brexit?Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin calls for UK to leave EU customs union As Wetherspoons scraps Twitter – is social media important for brands?Mr Martin said an end to tariffs\u0026nbspwould reduce shop and pub prices, however, he also warned that prices at Wetherspoons branches were likely to rise in the near future, because the chain is unwilling to cut costs at the expense of customer service. “I think what we’ll do is keep our prices as low as we reasonably can, they might have to go up a little bit, and just do the right thing and hope that is compensated by rising sales which will pay for the cost increases,” he told the BBC.Wetherspoons has begun replacing EU-made products such as champagne with British items, and said it intends to buy less beer from the EU and swap it for brewers in the UK and outside Europe.

Mr Cuomo held a decisive lead over Ms Nixon leading up to Thursday’s vote, with his progressive opponent trailing by 41 per cent in a poll published just before the election.\u0026nbspMs Nixon received nearly 278,000 votes compared to Mr Cuomo’s 534,922 in data received an hour after polling sites closed, with 49 per cent of districts reporting.\u0026nbsp“We started with nothing and we earned every single vote,” Cynthia Nixon said on Thursday in her concession speech. “We had fundamentally changed the political landscape in this state.In a follow-up tweet, the progressive candidate wrote, “This isn’t just a symbolic victory.”“This campaign forced the Governor to make concrete commitments that will change the lives of people across this state,”\u0026nbspshe continued.​​The defeated gubernatorial candidate saluted Zephyr Teachout, who ran against Letitia James for attorney general, as well as Jumaane\u0026nbspWilliams, who ran against Kathy Hochul for lieutenant governor, in her concession speech.\u0026nbspNeither won their elections, as Ms James secured a historic win to become the state attorney general while Ms Hochul\u0026nbspheld onto her seat as lieutenant governor in Albany.The Associated Press called the victory at\u0026nbsp9.30pm.\u0026nbspWith Thursday’s victory, Mr Cuomo will appear on the November election ballot as the Democratic Party’s official nominee, spurring immediate speculation about a presidential bid in 2020 against Donald Trump.\u0026nbspIn an interview with The Independent ahead of the primaries, the actress and first-time candidate made it clear that her campaign against Mr Cuomo was just the beginning of her political career in New York.\u0026nbsp“I want to make it clear that I have been fighting for a lot of these issues much longer than from the start of this campaign,” she said on Tuesday, adding, “I’m not going anywhere.”Mr Cuomo has situated himself as one of the president’s most vocal critics as governor, attacking him over his alleged falsities and criticising his hard-line policies impacting immigrants arriving at the US-Mexico border and beyond.\u0026nbspNew York New York: A Visual Hymn by Richard KoekEast River State Park in BrooklynThird Avenue in ManhattanBergdorf and Goodman on Fifth Avenue in ManhattanAMC Empire, 42nd street in ManhattanFulton Street in BrooklynA passenger with his pet on the G-train in BrooklynBowery in ManhattanWhyte Avenue in BrooklynTimes Square in ManhattanSquibb Park in BrooklynBroadway in ManhattanSeventh Avenue in ManhattanGotham Awards at Cipriani Wall Street in ManhattanOculus Church Street in ManhattanModels get ready in the Manhattan Centre on 34th streetThird Avenue on 149th street in the BronxWhitney Museum of American Art in ManhattanEast River State Park in BrooklynThird Avenue in ManhattanBergdorf and Goodman on Fifth Avenue in ManhattanAMC Empire, 42nd street in ManhattanFulton Street in BrooklynA passenger with his pet on the G-train in BrooklynBowery in ManhattanWhyte Avenue in BrooklynTimes Square in ManhattanSquibb Park in BrooklynBroadway in ManhattanSeventh Avenue in ManhattanGotham Awards at Cipriani Wall Street in ManhattanOculus Church Street in ManhattanModels get ready in the Manhattan Centre on 34th streetThird Avenue on 149th street in the BronxWhitney Museum of American Art in ManhattanMr Cuomo’s\u0026nbspopponents — including Marc Molinaro, the Republican gubernatorial candidate for New York who ran unopposed in Thursday’s primary elections — have attacked him on state issues, from the city’s failing subway system to a major gap in education funding for lower-income schools compared to those in upper class neighbourhoods across the state.\u0026nbspMs Nixon could still stand\u0026nbspin November’s midterm elections against Mr Cuomo under the Working Families Party, which endorsed her earlier this year.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

A life-threatening storm surge is now highly likely along portions of the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina, and a Storm Surge Warning is in effect for a portion of this area. All interests from South Carolina into the mid-Atlantic region should complete preparations and follow any advice given by local officials.2. Life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding and significant river flooding is likely over portions of the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states from late this week into early next week, as Florence is expected to slow down as it approaches the coast and moves inland.3. Damaging hurricane-force winds are likely along portions of the coasts of South Carolina and North Carolina, and a Hurricane Warning is in effect. Strong winds could also spread inland into portions of the Carolinas.4. Large swells affecting Bermuda and portions of the U.S. East Coast will continue this week, resulting in life-threatening surf and rip currents.Hurricane Florence: The storm is expected to strike Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina (Image: EPA)11.57am update: Seas to become dangerous ahead of Florence\u0027s arrivalAccuweather\u0026nbspforecasters warned large swells will propagate outward hundreds of miles away from the center of the storm this week.The swells will make for rough seas, according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.The rough surf and seas can occur hundreds of miles away from the path of the storm, Sosnowski said.11.51am update Florence\u0027s track forecast has now become less certainThe Weather Channel said: That high-pressure dome aloft over the western Atlantic is now expected to weaken Thursday into Friday.This will mean winds steering Florence will collapse for a time, slowing Florence\u0027s forward speed to a crawl as its center near the coast from Thursday night into Friday.With low wind shear and warm ocean water, Florence could gain a little more strength through early Thursday. Regardless, Florence will be a dangerous, formidable hurricane nearing the East Coast beginning late Thursday night.11.39am update: Latest NOAA maps and NHC advisories releasedThe NOAA and NHC have released their latest graphics, which show where the hurtling Hurricane Florence is headed over the coming days.Images below show the storm\u0027s barrelling path, along with where watches and warnings are in place.Hurricane Florence NOAA map: This map shows the latest rainfall forecast (Image: NOAA)Hurricane Florence NOAA map: This map shows where storm surge warnings are in place (Image: NOAA)Hurricane Florence NOAA map: This map shows Hurricane Florence\u0027s path (Image: NOAA)11.35am update: Florence will reach the Carolina coasts and pose a serious threat to lives and property late this weekAccuWeather meteorologists believe Florence will wreak extensive damage due to its predicted path, which is perpendicular to the coast, rather than at an oblique angle.AccuWeather Founder and President\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspJoel N Myers said:\u0026nbspThis means the east and southeast winds on the east side of the storm are going to be most effective in driving storm surge flooding as the wind and waves pound the coast.That is one of many factors in why AccuWeather is estimating $30 billion in economic impact and damage\u0026nbspfrom Florence.11.26am update: Hurricane closes in on CarolinasThe category 4 hurricane is located about 575 miles (925 km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour), it said.The center of Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas today, and approach the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina in the hurricane warning area on Thursday and Friday, the NHC said.11.00am update: The National Weather Service issued an ominous warningThis will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that`s saying a lot given the impacts we`ve seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd and Matthew, it said.I can`t emphasize enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge and inland flooding with this storm.Hurricane Florence map: Landfall will happen on Thursday (Image: MY FOX HURRICANE)10.20am update: Florence is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane as it approaches the coastThe 5am\u0026nbspNOAA advisory: Florence will continue to be steered west-northwestward to northwestward around the southwestern portion of a mid-level ridge centered northeast of Bermuda.By late Thursday, a mid-level ridge is forecast to begin building over the east-central United States, which is expected to cause Florence to slow down significantly by 48 hours.The track guidance is in good agreement through the first couple of days of the forecast period, and the NHC track forecast again brings the center of the hurricane very close to the coasts of North and South Carolina within 48 hours.10.00am update: Shops run out of emergency supplies as evacuations continueShops along the coast have been wiped of the bare essentials as panic buying begins.\u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no water.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what kind of cataclysm is so scary that youd move to the middle of nowhere just to avoid it?It could be natural disasters, or someone [the US] ticked off, Rodney says.One of 54-year-old Rodneys biggest fears is that North Korea will attack America with an electromagnetic pulse  weapon.EMPs can be triggered by detonating a nuclear warhead above the Earths surface - creating a burst of radioactive energy which can disable all electrical devices in a huge radius.Well be knocked back 200 years, he says. Everybody should be prepared.If Rome fell, then the US can fall too.As such, Rodney left civilisation to start a new le at the end of the world, along with 11 other family members, hoping to escape Armageddon by cutting themselves off from society and becoming self sufficient.That means living without electricity, running water or any shops for miles around, but for Rodneys family, and an increasing number of people like them, it seems like a small price to pay for guaranteed survival.Fear has driven Rodney and his we, Kaye, to take up arms and teach their family how to shoot - in case their home is ever attacked.Rodney oversees an armoury loaded with guns and even explosives - which the family will turn into landmines to defend their 40-acre property when society falls apart.Kaye, meanwhile, sleeps with a loaded pistol by her bed, and in her wardrobe she keeps a tomahawk - a small axe designed for hand-to-hand combat.In case the worse comes to the worst, she says.The family stockpile isnt just limited to weapons, however.Over the years, Kaye, 55, has also stowed away thousands of tins, jars and boxes of food in a storage shed dedicated to keeping the family fed and watered in an emergency.Jam, canned in 1978, is still resting on the shelf and preserved leftovers are kept in a fridge just in case.The children go to school but, otherwise, most of their time is consumed by the never-ending chores which keep the family going.Twice a week, water has to be fetched from a well on the other side of the compound, and Lakotas mum, Shareena, spends hours every week driving her kids to and from the bus stop where they can catch a ride into the nearest school.Hours every day are also spent preparing food for the ever-growing stockpile, and anything - including reeds from local rivers - can be pickled and put to good use.There is also livestock to feed - pigs, chickens and turkeys - and a pack of over 30 specially bred wolf-dogs to look after.Its a lot of effort, and her prepper lestyle has even cost Kaye her relationship with her dad, who doesnt understand why she is so keen to sacrice so many of her comforts.For others, being prepared means more than just stocking up on guns and tinned food.In South Dakota, you can find a former weapons depot consisting of row upon row of 575 secure, blast-proof concrete bunkers.A growing community of preppers from all over the country are currently in the process of buying them up and converting them into homes to flee to.Suzy has recently bought one of these bunkers with her boyfriend, Mark.The pair are planning to sell their house and move so they can be nearer to their shelter as they do it up - and eventually get married in it.Suzy discovered the bunker complex after watching a YouTube video about the collapse of civilisation.One of the guys at work was telling me about certain cataclysms that may happen, so I started investigating, Suzy says.When the cataclysm happens, people will go crazy - robbing the stores and such. So [the government] will round everyone up.Theyll put them in a camp,  her boyfriend Mark interjects. And youll get a chip in your hand. Now theyve got you.These fears of a domineering post-apocalyptic government are what drove the pair to Vivos X point, the bunker complex dubbed the worlds largest survival community.Up to 5,000 like-minded survivors will be able to fit in the collection of reinforced concrete shelters, and site owner Robert Vicino is trying to sell a chunk of his safe haven to as many preppers as he can.But Suzys decision to up sticks and move into a windowless bunker has caused all sorts of problems with her family.Theyre not on board, she says. They think Im crazy. I think theyre all going to perish.And shes not the only one to fall out with loved ones over a bunker.Milton, a friend of the couple who they met while shopping for a bomb shelter, broke up with his we because she didnt support his decision to buy a £25,000 bunker.Were going through the orce process now, he says. The bunker was the straw that broke the camels back.However, not all preppers are so extreme, and gearing up for the apocalypse doesnt always have to be a chore.One company, Ready To Go Survival, has managed to tap in to a lucrative market of high-earners who want to insure themselves against Armageddon without giving up their home comforts.Founders Roman and Fabian run their business out of Fabians garage, in Austin, Texas.They sell survival gear, like radiation-proof outfits and gas masks, targeted at middle-class professionals concerned that the US might be attacked.Already, theyve sold over 5,000 haz-mat suits - designed to keep you alive in a chemical, biological or nuclear attack and priced at 100  each.They also sell protection kits for dogs, in the form of little bags filled with canine medical essentials which you can strap to your pet.It takes 90 minutes for the average family to pack up and evacuate their home, Roman says. We want to take that down to 90 seconds.Its about prepping for the small stuff. Start with basic necessities and then grow from there.However, as relaxed as Roman may sound, hes still very serious about prepping.Downstairs in the garage, he keeps his motorbike ready to go at all times, and he knows he can escape from the city in mere minutes  he need to.Prepping is already mainstream, business partner Fabian says. Its just not on your daily news.Its easy to laugh but, for thousands of preppers all over the world, it makes sense to pay any price today  it guarantees that there will be a tomorrow.Of course, theres a good chance that all of their worrying - and spending - will be for nothing, and that the world will keep turning peacefully for millenia to come.But, as unlikely as it is, its safe to say that none of us will be laughing  the preppers predictions of imminent doom come true, and we find ourselves standing on the wrong side of the blast doors when doomsday comes.Stacey Dooley Investigates: Face to Face with Armageddon is available on BBC Three from 10am on Tuesday 18th September.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But images of Skripal and his daughter walking through the town show the weather to be mild with the ground free of slush.They claim: The Russians say they arrived in Salisbury on March 3, the day before the attack, but insist they left early then too due to snow.Boshirov said: On the 3rd we spent no more than an hour there.What we know: The pair were pictured on CCTV at a train station in Salisbury on that day. Despite claiming they only spent an hour there, authorities say they left after 4pm having arrived at 2.25pm. UK police believe the two were carrying out a practice run.They claim: They say friends had been suggesting that they visit Salisbury.What we know: They chose not to stay in one of more than 60 hotels and guesthouses in the city. Instead, they went back and forth on trains from London.They claim: The alleged hit men claim they “hadn’t heard” the name Skripal before the attack and do not know whether they walked by his house.Boshirov said: “Maybe we passed by it, maybe we didnt pass by it, I dont know, I hadnt heard this surname.”What we know: The pair claim they were in Salisbury to visit the cathedral – however, after leaving the train station they were shown on CCTV walking north-west towards the Skripal’s home, instead of south-east towards the church.At 11.58am on March 4, the pair are spotted in Wilton Road, less than a mile from Christie Miller Road, Mr Skripals address. Police say this was just “moments before” the attack.They then caught the train back to London at 1.05pm - having arrived in Salisbury at around 11.48am. The pair then fly back to Moscow from Heathrow later that evening.They claim: Petrov claims they wanted see nearby Stonehenge but it didn’t work out because of the slush.What we know: A spokesman for bus operator Salisbury Reds said: The tour buses ran as normal on Sunday 4 March.They claim: The men claim to have pictures of their visit to the cathedral. Conspiracy theorists had said British authorities faked the images of them in the city. Boshirov also said CCTV photos of them walking through Gatwick may have been faked because of the timestamp.What we know: They have failed to release pictures of them at the tourist sight but have admitted they were in the city, rubbishing conspiracy theories. Cops have already said there are two parallel channels at the airport.They claim: The alleged assassins claims they are midscale entrepreneurs involved in the fitness industry who deal in everything that comes to sport nutrition, vitamins, micro-elements, proteins and so on.What we know: Prime Minister Theresa May said that based on the body of intelligence the pair are officers from the Russian military intelligence service.They claim: The pair say they were in the country for a holiday.What we know: They havent explained why they had booked two alternative  flights home.Friday March 2 20181500: Suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov arrive at Gatwick Airport, having flown from Moscow on Aeroflot flight SU2588.1740: The pair arrive at London Victoria station by train from Gatwick.1800: They then travel on public transport to Waterloo station, and then to the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London, where they stay for two nights.Saturday March 31145: The pair arrive at Waterloo station, having left the hotel, bound for Salisbury.

It’s not a border down the Irish Sea.“Essentially it would involve addressing issues such as technical controls at the ports between Northern Ireland and Great Britain which already exist.“Nothing revolutionary is being proposed here, it’s simply a question of building on what’s already been achieved.”An EU source told The Sun that officials would look at it with a view to seeing whether checks could be moved away from the border or aided by technology.They said: “We can’t de-dramatise it by ourselves. We’re still open to the UK coming with something but as time goes by it looks less likely.”A second source added: “The UK has provided us with some of the data, which we’ll look at together with them.“This data will be helpful to better understand trade flows between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”British negotiators have reportedly given their EU counterparts assurances that they will compromise on the backstop after the Tory party conference.But EU officials are still wary of the fact that any compromise on the border could be torpedoed by eurosceptics.A diplomatic source said: “The real question is what will happen with the domestic dynamics in the UK.“The Tory conference is a huge political risk factor to the final stage of the negotiations.”Mr Raab and Mr Barnier held their weekly talks over the phone yesterday after plans for a face to face meeting were cancelled.The Brexit Secretary said: “While there remain some substantive dferences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was a field and the Germans had deliberately flooded it with water from a nearby river.“When I dropped into the water I wasn’t aware of anyone near me at all. It was quite some time before I linked up with anyone else.“It was quite hazardous, 192 men from one battalion died in the area. But I managed to survive it.”Read loved parachuting, but he was forced to leave his regiment after injuring his leg during the war.He was awarded the Chevalier award by the order of the Legion d’honneur two years ago for his heroism.The vet now plans to jump again next June after being told he has the “heart of a 40-year-old man” by a doctor.He said: “I did not like my first jump in the 1940s, but I liked the second and the subsequent ones.The parachute regiment jumped the night before D-Day to try and destroy the guns that could target the British troops on the Normandy beaches. They took the Germans by surprise when they the seized bridges within ten minutes of landing. These imperative missions lead the Allied forces to a successful mission that became a turning point in World War Two.“There was not very nice people waiting for me last time I jumped.Read completed his jump to raise money for the Salvation Army’s child abuse and human trafficking programme.So far he has raised £4,330.71."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000325016043.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ex rbs chief fred goodwin pension pot","story":"The disgraced chief executive - dubbed Fred the Shred - was widely considered to be responsible for the banks near-collapse in 2008.When he stepped down that same year, he was stripped of his knighthood and agreed to a £200,000 reduction in his pension entitlement.But the Mirror reports that he enjoys a £450,000 a year pension, as well as raking in £6million since quitting a decade ago - with a £2.8million lump sum.Robin Hood Tax campaign director David Hillman told the newspaper: “Goodwin ­symbolises the height of ­unfairness.“After driving his bank into the ground, he walked off with a golden handshake.The newspaper claims the 60-year-old is continuing to live the high le, despite millions of people being more than £23,000 worse off every year on average following the financial crash.He was apparently seen driving a £12,000 rare 1988 BMW 635CSi near his large home in the Grange area of Edinburgh.Goodwin was cleared of any wrongdoing over the collapse of RBS by the ­Financial Services Authority.The 2008 recession was triggered by the collapse of Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers, unleashing a wave of market turmoil across the globe.In a bid to save the UKs financial system, RBS was rescued from the brink of collapse by a government bailout.Earlier this week, RBSs chairman Sir Howard Davies admitted it is unlikely taxpayers will get back all the £45.5bn pumped in to the bank.He said restructuring costs, losses on loans and selling businesses meant RBS was valued at less than taxpayers paid for their stake.Looking back on the decade since the financial crisis, he told a lecture that the government is unlikely to recoup its investment in full.Though formally cleared of any wrongdoing Goodwin is currently being sued for up to £3billion by Taiwanese ­shipping magnate Nobu Su for allegedly using his companys cash to keep the bank afloat before it collapsed.The billionaire chairman of Today Makes Tomorrow , accuses Goodwin - along with two ex-colleagues and the bank itself - of hijacking TMTs accounts and using them as unlimited cash machines.Between 2007 and 2009, when RBS was on the brink of disaster, the tycoon claims Goodwin siphoned off billions of dollars without consent.It is the second time in as many years that Goodwin has faced a potential trip to court due to his role in RBS near-collapse.In 2017 he escaped being summoned to the High Court as a witness after thousands of shareholders who complained of being misled into buying the banks shares accepted an out-of-court deal with RBS."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433786634.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uranus examiner newspaper split with readers","story":"Locals in the town of Uranus plumped for the cheeky title — but district officials think they’ve dug themselves into a hole.Luge Hardman, mayor of neighbouring US city Waynesville, says she will not be placing official notices in the publication.She stormed: “I’m sorry but the innuendo of that title puts my city up for public ridicule — and I will not be a part of it.”The weekly publication will replace the defunct Waynesville Daily Guide when it goes on sale in south Missouri next month.Managing editor Natalie Sanders said of the title: “We thought about Constitution but most people who love us and who were part of coming up with the name, liked Examiner better.”The town of Uranus, with 25 residents, is used to poking fun at itself.Businesses include the Fudge Factory And General Store.

The ­family’s beloved pet dog was also killed by deranged Michael Stone.Josie herself was left with such severe head injuries that medics at she scene thought she was dead before finding a faint pulse.This little girl was a fighter.It must have been horrendous for both of them.Josie couldn’t speak for a year after the attack, had to have an operation to put a titanium plate in her head and her recovery was slow. It was all about small ­victories, and it was down to the tenacity of a little girl who just wanted to live a normal le.Now she is flourishing.Josie has become a successful artist, is engaged to her soul mate Iwan Jones and recently bought the family home in Wales where she spent her early childhood before they all moved to Kent where the attack happened.The house is full of happy memories and Josie dwells on events like her mum bringing home Rosie the pony when she was just five years old and teaching her to ride.Rosie is now a grand old lady of 27 and one of the most ­important things in Josie’s le.The feisty little pony is a link to her mum and little sister and played a massive part in her recovery. Learning how to ride again gave her confidence and a sense of freedom.Josie graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2009 and built up her own art business, first by selling handmade cards at fairs and now producing beautul ­textile landscapes.I’ve met Josie several times over the years, most memorably shortly after the accident when she was still coming to terms with the double tragedy of the death of both her mum and sister.She was shy and wary but gradually I gained her confidence and we spent a lovely afternoon together with her dad Shaun and Rosie the pony.I caught up with her again this week, and I’m always struck by her positivity and her refusal to be thought of as a victim.She very much lives in the moment and always tries to seize the day and be positive.Josie is a walking testament to the power of the human spirit and her mum would be very proud of her beautul, talented, happy daughter.LOTS of speculation already over who will be heading Down Under for I’m A Celebrity in November.Names being bandied around include EastEnder Danny Dyer, Corrie’s Michael Le Vell and former Strictly pro Brendan Cole.GMB’s Kate Garraway is keeping mum about rumours but she would be a hoot, although the person I’d really like to see there is my pal and TV colleague Dr Hilary Jones, who we’ve mocked up in the jungle, pictured.A team player and an action man, he also has a filthy sense of humour, doesn’t suffer fools gladly and would dispense medicine and advice when the insects start to bite and tummies get upset after being fed a diet of ostrich bum.And at the risk of objectying the good doctor, I would pay good money to see him in his skimpies having a shower at the famous waterfall.The ambitious project was first discussed in 2004, when I was rector of Dundee University. It’s wonderful to see it spring to le.Inevitably, costs spiralled. But hopefully the increase in tourism, business and the jobs created will more than offset the £80million price tag.As a proud adopted Dundonian, I want the V\u0026ampA to be a museum for everyone. I hope schoolchildren will enjoy the exhibits, friends will meet there for coffee and everyone in Dundee will think of it as their own.It’s here and I can’t wait to celebrate.IT’S a bit icky – and frankly unbelievable – that Corrie has Jim McDonald pretending his current girlfriend is his dead daughter in order to wreak revenge on his clan.More Game Of Thrones than a game of dominoes down the Rovers... and I can’t take it seriously., so I am. I’ve missed him bellowing “ELIZABETH!” and talking about being in the big house, so I have.I just wish they hadn’t oversensationalised his  because the character is big enough not to need such an OTT comeback.It did get me thinking as to who else I would like to see back in Soapland.And one fab character sprang to mind. I’m sure you recall Emmerdale’s Paul Lambert, who made a huge impact during his five years in the Dales.Paul was played by the ridiculously handsome Mathew Bose, who must have a painting in the attic because he hasn’t aged a day since leaving school.Surely his  is long overdue. His family are still in Emmerdale, including dad Rodney Blackstock, auntie Diane Sugden and his half-sisters. There are lots of layers to Paul, too.His alter-ego is drag queen Thelma Louise, while he and his boyfriend Jonny were the first characters in a primetime drama to have a civil partnership, back in 2008.Surely such an interesting character should be welcomed back to Emmerdale with open arms.We will know more tomorrow night, but I’m spending far more time than is good for me speculating about how it’s all going to be resolved.IT’S been a long time since I considered Jacob Rees-Mogg an amusing anachronism, a bit like a pocket watch.Behind this softly spoken throwback to the Victorian age is a flinty hard-liner who would deny a raped woman the right to an abortion.He’s hell-bent on a rock-hard Brexit, and he doth protest too much about not wanting to be Prime Minister for it to ring true. So it’s fair to say I’m not a fan.But I was appalled by the rude, ignorant mob of “class warriors” who heckled his kids and their elderly nanny outside the family home this week.It was cruel, savage and out of order. Rees-Mogg has chosen to be a politician and is used to being barracked.His children, however, are NOT public figures. They are little kids, who looked scared by the thuggish behaviour of the idiots, who did their cause no good at all.They were there to protest about the minimum wage, and one of them shouted at the children that their nanny, Veronica Crook, wasn’t paid very much to “wipe their bottoms”.Veronica, who has been with the family for half a century, was not best pleased by this, and in a brisk, no-nonsense way defended her boss and ushered her charges indoors. You got the feeling she would dearly have loved to give the protesters a very hard stare and sit them on the naughty step.Politicians from all sides expressed their disgust but those responsible don’t think they have done anything wrong.The minimum wage is well worth fighting for, but not like this.The demonstrators managed to humanise Rees-Mogg, and gained him bucketloads of sympathy.

May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In this week’s Ayes To The Left podcast, the Big Issue founder reveals how he learned the skills to build his hugely successful career in prison. In a frank and funny chat with the Mirror’s Mikey Smith and Dan Bloom, the avuncular crossbench peer talked about homelessness, poverty, Thatcher, Blair and whether he wants to see Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. And he revealed whether he still thinks all politicians are “failures.”   The peer has just seen his first Bill through the Lords into the Commons - a bid to help tenants get better credit ratings while they are stuck renting.  Some politicians warn the public off borrowing. But Lord Bird dismissed the “Margaret Thatcher thing” that credit itself is “some kind of terrible, horrible thing.  He said: “I have always believed in the opportunity that borrowing creates. I’ve just bought a super duper sofa which cost 1,500 quid and my we being a canny lass has got it at \u0026pound40 a month over four years without any interest. Now you can only do that  you’re in mortgages and all that sort of stuff.  It is wrong to borrow money you can’t pay back. And it can impede your development. But borrowing money to do things which are more than day-to-day, that’s when it gets interesting.”  He added: If you didn’t have those things, there wouldn’t be 300 cheeses to choose from in Waitrose or Tescos. You wouldn’t be able to have the kind of almost imitation aristocratic le we all like to have on a Friday or Saturday night.” Lord Bird blamed Tory austerity as the driving force behind soaring homelessness. But he also recoils at directing attacks at Theresa May personally.  “Why is it you go into a card shop and there’s a big thing you can buy and put on your wall that says ‘dance as though nobody’s watching’, he said. And then poor old Theresa May dances as though nobody would wanna watch and we start taking the mickey out of her. Why don’t we grow up and get serious about politics rather than looking for the kind of problems… May has her problems, let’s deal with those, let’s not personalise.”  Six years ago the peer said all politicians were failures. Has he changed his mind? “No I haven’t, he told us.  Well I feel kind of sorry for them. It’s a terrible thing, it sounds very patronising. I think you poor person, you’re going to go through hell and have a nice time and you might grasp the realms of power and you might be able to hang on. But you’ll be out the door one day and you’ll be looking back… and the things you might have caused to happen may come back and bite you in the bum.” He added: “They’re rushing around like blue rear end flies from one place to another. We have to reinvent politics. “I have come here for the most revolutionary programme for British politics imaginable.  It is not about getting Corbyn in and May out, it’s not about anything like that. It’s about saying why is it that you’ve got all these wonderful projects, all these people thinking outside the box, but the box itself is full of lame duck thinking, really terrible forms of legislation that don’t free people up and develop them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brian reade motley collection tory","story":"NewsopinionBrian Reade: Motley collection of Tory Brexiteers exposed as the third-rate charlatans they areA picture is worth a thousand words, but that forlorn image of Rees-Mogg, Johnson and Bone with their heads in their hands was worth 1.1 trillion, writes Brian ReadeShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByBrian Reade19:25, 14 SEP 2018Updated19:27, 14 SEP 2018NewsopinionThis is the photo which underscored the fact Tory Brexiteers don\u0027t have a leg between them to stand on \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI never thought I’d see a more absurd crew of politicians than at the 1995 launch of John Redwood’s bid to be Tory leader. The motley collection of swivel-eyed, boating-blazered, Euro-hating freaks was so comically scary that The Addams Family producers would have deemed them box office gold. But this week’s line-up of the latest motley collection of swivel-eyed, Euro-hating freaks who cynically go under the objective-sounding title of the European Research Group banner, proved me wrong. It was even funnier. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but that forlorn image of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson and Peter Bone with their heads in their hands was worth 1.1 trillion. One word for each of the pounds Rees-Mogg claimed Britain would gain  from sticking two fingers up to Europe and leaving without a deal.  The hard-Brexit gang had promised to unveil a vision they’d worked on all their political lives, one that should have been honed to perfection, but instead we got blurred waffle about tax cuts and sending the navy to the Falklands, which drew nothing but guffaws. Dublin politicians branded their Irish border proposals “dreamland stuff” and the boss of Jaguar Land Rover warned “we will not be able to build cars here”  their preferred no deal happens. Even the Daily Mail mocked them for not having the numbers to bring down Theresa May, a proper candidate to put up against her or a credible Brexit plan. Hence their head-in-hands despair as they realised their cack-handed attempt to convince voters they could turn Britain into some 19th century Little England paradise was doomed. To borrow a trending phrase, they’d wrapped a suicide vest around their project and handed the detonator to any onlooker with half a brain. The thing about these militants from the Rees-Mogg Tendency is they know what they hate – any attempt to harmonise with the EU. But not what they want, apart from a blue passport and Land of Hope and Glory sung at every school assembly.  Now the PR managers from Vote Leave can no longer keep them locked in the cellar like demented relatives, they’ve emerged into the light and been seen for what they truly are. UKIP soulmates with a Tory seat. The “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists” that David Cameron referred to. They’ve talked the EU-hating talk but now it’s time to walk it, they’ve gone lame. That red bus bearing the \u0026pound350million-a-week lie about funding an NHS they would like to dismantle, has driven off. The fog thrown up by Nigel Farage’s cigarette smoke has cleared and they’ve emerged from it like the worst Stars In Their Eyes acts, poor impersonations of serious politicians, exposed as the third-rate charlatans they are. Remainers on the left, like me, admitted the EU was flawed and had some sympathy with people like Dennis Skinner who’ve always seen it as an undemocratic capitalist club.

Rapid and seismic change is likely to lead in the interim to unemployment, dislocation and rising inequality, Mark Carney added. Increasing automation of jobs represents a Fourth Industrial Revolution which threatens a 10th of UK posts and 15% in Ireland, Mr Carney told an audience at the Republic\u0027s Central Bank in Dublin. He said: Unlike in the previous industrial revolutions, the more rapid pace of adjustment and longer working lives means workers may not have the option of retiring. This raises risks of substantial skills mismatch, leading to increased structural unemployment and adverse macroeconomic outcomes.   He delivered his lecture after warning British Government ministers that house prices could crash by more than a third in the event of a disorderly, no-deal Brexit .  His comments in Ireland focused on the challenge to traditional employment posed by technology and the use of articial intelligence. He said those without the skills to exploit the move towards roles geared to originality or emotional intelligence could be left unemployed. Employers and societies will also have to deal with the decrease in the labour supply produced by an ageing population. The governor raised the role of innovation in education to try to prevent a skills mismatch. He said: The biggest issue may be how to institutionalise retraining in mid-career and to integrate it with the social welfare system.

Daring participants used a whole host of props - including footballs, boots and skis - to strategically hide their privates from prying eyes. Undergraduate Emma Teal said her fellow nudists had fun while posing for the cheeky fundraiser.  She said: We all really enjoyed making the calendar, although it did involve a lot of early mornings as we had to go to the locations when there weren\u0027t too many people about. Emma continued: “I\u0027ve been involved in quite a lot of charity projects over the years, from volunteering my time, to completing physical challenges to fund raise. So when I came to university I knew I wanted to join a charitable society, and creating a naked calendar with Cambridge Raising and Giving  society seemed like the most fun way to raise lots of money for great causes.”  The calendar will go on sale from October 10 and will cost \u0026pound10. Last year\u0027s edition, which was the first time the calendar was published, raised over \u0026pound10,000 for charitable causes. Funds raised this time around will go to a host of charities including Beat Eating Disorders, Mary\u0027s Meals Papyrus and the Cambridge Rape Crisis Centre.

The former Royal Bank of Scotland boss was pictured smirking in one of his classic cars – and he has plenty to smile about after it emerged his pension pot is worth \u0026pound17million. He has already raked in \u0026pound6million since quitting in disgrace a decade ago, with a \u0026pound2.8million lump sum. But it is a very dferent story for the millions of ordinary households who are on average \u0026pound23,400 a year worse off thanks to the crash that Goodwin and other gambling bankers caused.  And he seems to be showing little remorse over the 90,000 RBS jobs lost or the billions of pounds forked out by taxpayers to rescue his doomed bank. His clear disregard for those left trailing in the wake of the devastating financial disaster as he enjoys a \u0026pound450,000 a year pension last night sparked fury. Robin Hood Tax campaign director David Hillman said: “Goodwin \u0026shysymbolises the height of \u0026shyunfairness. “After driving his bank into the ground, he walked off with a golden handshake. “No wonder he’s still grinning from ear to ear 10 years later.”  Goodwin was pictured by the Mirror behind the wheel of his \u0026pound12,000 rare 1988 BMW 635CSi with the apt plate 666 – the number of the beast in the Bible. Wearing shades, he drove off from his large house in \u0026shyEdinburgh’s plush Grange area. The BMW is believed to be one of a number of classic cars he owns. He has also been seen driving a convertible Triumph Stag to play 18-hole golf at his golf course at \u0026shyArcherfield in East Lothian, with fees of \u0026pound30,000. The crash happened after Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers dramatically collapsed, sending the world’s financial system into meltdown. Britain’s big banks were plunged into chaos by the \u0026shysubsequent credit crunch, leading to a \u0026pound130billion bailout.  RBS, which had morphed into the world’s biggest bank through a wave of \u0026shyquestionable \u0026shytakeovers, was rescued from the brink of collapse the following month. For those at the wrong end of the \u0026shyfinancial scale, the crash caused nothing but misery as the Government dipped into the public purse to save the banks. Crippling austerity has unleashed anguish on millions of the poorest. And yet no senior banker has been jailed in the UK for the scandal. For many, Goodwin \u0026shypersonies those who \u0026shyprofited from the boom times before the crash and walked away from the mess scot-free. During his eight years in charge, the former accountant turned RBS into the world’s biggest bank by assets, a \u0026pound64billion global Goliath with 200,000 staff. Insiders claim after he was named as Forbes’ Businessman of the Year in 2002 it instilled a “supreme arrogance” in him. One source said he believed he could “walk on water” and added: “He was seen as some kind of banking demigod.”  Critics say Goodwin’s reign was marked by reckless lending and a series of takeovers, including NatWest and the disastrous acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Ambro in 2007. It is claimed RBS paid over the odds and failed to carry out sufficient checks. The bank lavished profits on luxuries such as an \u0026pound18million company jet and a permanent suite at London hotel The Savoy costing \u0026pound700,000 a year. But despite the carnage left behind by the RBS, Goodwin insists he has done nothing wrong. Author Ian Fraser said: “Despite the fact he has been ostracised by the public, he has been accepted by elements of the Scottish establishment. “But then, Fred would expect nothing else. Perhaps the most shocking aspect of the RBS story is that he remains \u0026shyunrepentant and defiant.  “He still believes he wasn’t responsible and blames others. His lack of remorse and humility has been a common trait throughout this whole affair.” An acquaintance of Goodwin’s \u0026shydisagreed, insisting: “He felt deeply wounded by what people said.” In 2012, Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood, which had been handed to him by Tony Blair. He was also reportedly turfed out of the family home by we Joyce after she \u0026shydiscovered he was having an affair with a colleague. The couple, who have two children, orced in 2016. The \u0026shyFinancial Services Authority, cleared Goodwin of any \u0026shywrongdoing over the collapse of RBS. But he is being sued for up to \u0026pound3billion by Taiwanese \u0026shyshipping magnate Nobu Su, the billionaire chairman of Today Makes Tomorrow. He accuses Goodwin, along with two former colleagues and the bank, of “hijacking” TMT’s accounts and using them as “unlimited cash machines”. It is believed to be one of the biggest lawsuits ever against a UK inidual. As Goodwin continues his high le today, Shadow \u0026shyChancellor John McDonnell is due to address a rally organised by the coalition 10 Years On outside the Bank of England.  He will say: “One of the key lessons to be learnt from the crash is that never again must we allow finance to become the master of the economy, rather than its servant.” A campaigning pensioner is fighting for thousands of people who lost money in the fall of Northern Rock. Dennis Grainger, 72, said the Government is making \u0026pound9.6billion profit on the \u0026pound37billion used to bail out the Newcastle-based bank. But he added: “They are saying that is going to keep the profits to offset the losses they made on RBS and other banks.” Crash fatcats who went on to get fatter  Adam Applegarth  Under him Northern Rock was transformed from a sleepy Newcastle building society into the UK’s fth biggest mortgage lender. But risky policies, including 125% Together mortgages, were its undoing. Fears for its future led to customers queueing outside branches to get their money out. Applegarth, paid \u0026pound10million in the five years before it collapsed, sauntered away with a \u0026pound760,000 pay-off. In 2009, he began advising US private equity firm Apollo Management.

A new \u0027uglier\u0027 crisis is around the corner   Analysis by Richard Murphy , Professor of Practice in International Political Economy at City, University of London   ON September 15, 2008, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial crisis began. Ten years later, that situation has not really ended. Worse, many economists — me included — think a new crisis may be around the corner. So what happened, why, and what might happen next time? Lehman crashed because it had run out of money. Within weeks, the crisis had spread. In October 2008, then Chancellor Alistair Darling was told Royal Bank of Scotland was just hours away from also running out of cash. And RBS going down was not an option.  Lehman Brothers was not a high street bank, RBS was. So too were Lloyds, HBOS and Bradford \u0026amp Bingley. All were heading the same way as Northern Rock, which had collapsed a year earlier. Mr Darling could let the banks fail — as the US had let Lehman Brothers fail — or bail them out. But the truth was that he had no choice. If RBS went down, millions of people in the UK would have had no access to money. And that might also have been true of hundreds of thousands of businesses. If a bank like RBS failed, it was likely others would go down. On average most British households have no more than three days food in stock. People and supermarkets without banks would have meant panic and food riots. So Mr Darling bailed out the banks, as any responsible Chancellor would have done. But most of us have been paying for that ever since. Between 1998 and March 2008, the Government borrowed \u0026pound186billion to keep the economy going.

The horric footage shows a lorry smashing into a row of parked cars while the driver peers down at his mobile phone while on the motorway. Lorry driver Tomasz Kroker had been changing the music on his phone when he ploughed into stationary traffic in 2015. He killed Tracy Houghton, 45, and her sons Ethan, 13, and Joshua, 11, as well as her partner\u0027s daughter, Aimee Goldsmith, 11.   Surrey Police released the distressing footage in a bid to stop drivers using their phones at the wheel, Get Surrey reports.  Josh and Ethan\u0027s dad, Doug, said the youngsters had been planning on playing Pokemon Go in Hyde Park when they got back from their holiday. He said: I thought that was the worst day of my le, my kids being killed. But I think it was three weeks later when I went to the funeral director\u0027s and actually saw them, dead, cold, in their coffins. Aimee\u0027s dad, Mark, said the children couldn\u0027t wait to get home to play Pokemon and said they hugged and kissed before getting into the car. In the video clip, Aimee\u0027s mum, Kate, recalled in tears how the police had knocked on her door and told her her daughter had been killed in a car accident.  I continue to see drivers using their phones and it sickens me, she said. If they had seen the devastation they brought my family, or to other families, by using phones, illegally... distracting themselves from driving a potential weapon... Would they be as sickened as we are? Kroker, 30, from Andover, Hampshire, was jailed for 10 years at Reading Crown Court after pleading guilty to four deaths by dangerous driving and a single count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

The bizarre club sees people uploading photos of themselves - and the only real rule is that there is a lamp in the picture. It has sparked a big online debate with many questioning whether they would be upset  their partner was posting or commenting on the risqu\u0026eacute pictures.  Plymouth Live\u0027s Katie Timms took a look into the world of the lamp lovers, read her article in full below.  Katie\u0027s findings Before I start, I just want to say I am not a serious member of this group - to any relatives of mine who read Plymouth Live, it\u0027s okay, we don\u0027t need to have \u0027a talk\u0027 about this.  The hottest topic on social media at the moment is a raunchy Facebook group iding hundreds of people. However, it\u0027s pretty secretive and most of us will never get access to it.    As a journalist, naturally I felt the need to investigate the page after reading about it on Plymouth Gossip Girls .  The now deleted post on the popular lamp-and-other-things-loving page, which received around 1,000 comments, saw half of the women claim they would be furious  their spouse was a member, while the other half thought it was a bit of fun. The group sees thousands of explicit pictures uploaded to the page. The only catch is that a lamp has to be visible in the image. While the original group is invite only, I stumbled across a \u0027private\u0027 spin-off group that everyone can request to join, which is pretty much the same thing and has almost 20,000 members.  Upon joining the group, named Lamp Lovers [heart] Cameltoe , I glimpsed hundreds of filthy pictures and comments which I will now have to attempt to bleach from my mind.  The more I scrolled the worse the pictures got. There were bare breasts, crotch shots and a lot of bums, with even raunchier comments. Occasionally there would be a picture of a man holding a lamp, fully clothed and smiling, but somehow I felt like that wasn\u0027t what the main aim of this group was for. People appreciate these pictures anyway. The group description invites people of all shapes, sizes, and genders to upload pictures and states that everybody\u0027s shape and size is encouraged to be shown.         There is nowhere that states the pictures need to be of a \u0027certain nature\u0027, however the pictures seem to be most popular  items of clothing are missing from the inidual. The group is definitely NSFW [not safe for work] and it\u0027s raised the question, would you want your signicant other posting in there? Many of the men on the group post innocent photos of themselves next to lamps, however some post obscene photographs of their wives. I posted a very innocent picture, but added the caption, Am I doing it right? and ended up getting an inbox full of messages and friend requests from random men from the group. Erm. Not all of the comments were dirty, and many commented to say I was doing it perfectly and that I was pretty, and classy beautul, which is pretty nice - and not sordid - unlike some of the comments on there.

Rhian Desouza, 43, received two pictures from the girl who had sent them over the social media app Snapchat. A court heard on Friday while it would have been lawful for the pair to have been in a sexual relationship, it was a criminal offence for an adult to possess and indecent images of a person aged below 18. Desouza was headteacher at Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Gellionnen primary school in Swansea when she began the relationship with the teen, who had not been a pupil of hers. Prosecutor Carina Hughes told Swansea Crown Court the girl\u0027s mother found text messages on her daughter\u0027s phone between her and Desouza and alerted police. Desouza was arrested and officers seized her Samsung smartphone, where they managed to retrieve two revealing photos of the girl sent between May and June this year.  The photos were only found using specialist software as they had been deleted from the phone, either automatically or by Desouza herself. Miss Hughes said: They appeared to be selfie images, possibly sent over the Snapchat app. Desouza, a mother-of-two, answered no comment in her interview but later pleaded guilty to two counts of making an indecent image of a child under 18. The teenage victim\u0027s mother told the court in a statement her daughter was now a shadow of her former self after the police involvement.  The mother said: She  prioritised her own sexual gratication over the needs of our daughter. If you cannot trust a teacher, then who can you trust? Georgina Buckley, defending, said Desouza had lost not only her profession but her vocation after being told she would not be able to work with children again.

The MP she said she felt mixed emotions as she received the Jo Cox Award at the No2H8 Crime Awards, backed by the Daily Mirror. Ms Berger, 37, told of her pride at her relentless battle being recognised, but also the poignancy of the award being in memory of her murdered friend and colleague. The Liverpool Wavertree MP said: “I feel honoured to receive the award, but at the same time wish it didn’t exist.”  She added of the awards ceremony, in Central London on Thursday night: “It was inspiring to hear so many stories of people across our country stand\u0026shy\u0026shying up to counter hate and promote tolerance.” Ms Berger is Jewish and has taken a strong stance against anti-Semitism, and in April won a standing ovation in the House of Commons. She told of enduring abuse from age 19, which escalated when she became an MP. Ms Berger received 2,500 hate tweets in a single day, and was sent death threats after a neo-Nazi killed Mrs Cox in 2016. So far five trolls have been prosecuted. The MP said: “The easier option would be to take a step back, but I’m not going to let the vocal minority who channel hate win. “That’s why the awards are so important... it shows that when people do come forward they are taken seriously.” Fiyaz Mughal OBE, awards founder, said: “This year we saw the best of Britain nominated for their work countering hatred.

Emma Murray had hoped to get her three-year-old into the same establishment that his 14 cousins attended.  She told Belfast Live : It\u0027s not the closest, but I have 14 nieces and nephews that have gone to Bunscoil Bheann Mhadagain, and some to Colaiste Feirste in West Belfast.  That\u0027s the reason I put him down - because he would have been the only one in the family that didn\u0027t attend it. Despite hand delivering her application while at the school collecting nieces and nephews, the part-time classroom assistant said little R\u0026uacutea was refused a place. And a subsequent appeal did not help either.  The 30-year-old said: I have done nothing but cry my eyes out over it. They sent me an email after the tribunal to say they are standing by their decision, that he didn\u0027t get it. It\u0027s basically because I am not falling into social disadvantage criteria and they told me that. I am a single parent and said \u0027I do fall into that category\u0027, they said \u0027you don\u0027t because you are a single parent that works\u0027. It makes me feel angry and like I should quit my job, because  I quit my job, I\u0027ll get everything else handed to me and my child would have got a place in nursery. They said in the tribunal he would have got a place  I didn\u0027t work. The New Lodge woman said she works 24-hours a week as a classroom assistant for the Education Authority at Trinity College on the Antrim Road. But someone has to look after her son while she\u0027s there, so she pays \u0026pound150 a week for daycare.  She added: I work 24 hours a week and earn at most \u0026pound700 a month. It\u0027s not a big income. I do get some help from tax credits. I struggle in day-to-day le, but I don\u0027t want to not work. Emma said the huge saving a nursery place would make her is not the only reason she wants a place for R\u0026uacutea. He\u0027s three years and eight months which means he\u0027s ready for primary school next year and will miss out on a year of nursery, she added. I have him in a daycare at the minute. I worked in one for 11 years and a daycare and nursery are completely dferent. When he goes to primary one, he\u0027s going to be behind and disadvantaged. He\u0027s going to have no structure. I can only teach him so much in the house. R\u0026uacutea\u0027s rejection from the naiscoil has left Emma feeling really disheartened because her family has always supported the Irish language school. It\u0027s just a kick in the teeth when you are told you can\u0027t have a place because you work, she added. Emma said the closest two nurseries to her home are New Lodge and the naiscoil - and that she is in the catchment area for both. But neither have a place for R\u0026uacutea.

Elsewhere, the empty stores and \u0026shybusinesses stand in mute testament to what was once a bustling high street. Now, there is a mish-mash of charity shops, bookies and pay day lenders. This Eccles in Greater Manchester, near where Ms Long-Bailey was raised. And the Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Secretary told how she backs the Mirror’s High Street fightback campaign to help revive blighted towns.  She said: “I grew up in Old Trafford just over the way and I spent a lot of time in Eccles. I live here now. “It used to be a busy, thriving place. My dad used to tell me stories about what a great night out it was, we had the most pubs within a square mile. “I can’t remember  it was in the North West or the UK but we were quite proud of that fact. “The big stores were here, Woolies and things like that.  “People came as a destination. I can remember when I was little coming here. It was exciting. “But it’s been dying. When you walk round you can see that. “The shops are empty or they’ve been replaced by charity shops or betting shops, pay day lenders or \u0026shybeauticians. They’re all key indicators of an area that’s in decline.”  Grim figures from the Local Data Company show 110 units in Eccles are empty, a vacancy rate of 23.6%. That is an increase on the 18.5% recorded in 2015, and the trend looks set to continue. Nationally, last year 5,855 stores closed, the most since 2010. Among them were 1,700 chain stores. We are campaigning for improved business rates, better transport links, an online tax and fairness across the board in a bid to save our High Streets.  Salford and Eccles MP Ms Long-Bailey said: “I’ve seen the Mirror’s campaign and I support it. “I think it’s fantastic and I wish the Government would listen instead of burying its head in the sand. The High Street is dying. That’s not just in Eccles, that’s all over the country. “There’s not a week that’s gone by without us hearing about one of the major stores going into administration and making thousands of workers redundant.  “We want to bring the High Street back to le. But first we have to be \u0026shyrealistic about the problems. First up, business rates are a massive problem. “The average shop has been hit by an increase of up to \u0026pound3,663 in the last year. “And places like Amazon have seen a decrease in their costs because of the way they’re calculated. “The big supermarkets are seeing a fall as well. But little shops are seeing a massive increase.” A lack of investment and underfunding by cash-strapped local councils is another problem. With car parking space at a premium and no longer free, that adds to the \u0026shypressure on local businesses as do supermarkets and big \u0026shyshopping centres.

Ruslan Borishov and Alexander Petrov gave an interview to Russian state TV channel RT yesterday after Met Police said there was enough evidence to charge them with the attempted assassination of the ex-spy and his daughter.  The pair claimed they had flown in the UK from Moscow to visit Salisbury Cathedral, staying at a hotel in Bow, east London, but flew home due to poor weather. But their claims - which Prime Minister Theresa May has branded \u0027insulting\u0027 - don\u0027t stand up to much scrutiny.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: The last time Russian military claimed to be on holiday was when they invaded Ukraine in 2014. There are at least nine flaws with their story.  1. Traces of Novichok found in their hotel room   On Thursday the pair spoke exclusively to RT - Russia Today - which is a state-controlled TV channel. They were not subject to a forensic level of questioning by hosts who seemed happy to take them at their word. The most glaring omission was the discussion of Novichok traces discovered in the hotel room they stayed in in Bow, east London. 2. Why stay in east London on a visit to Salisbury? With a straight face the pair insisted: Our friends have been suggesting for quite a long time that we visit this wonderful city. But then why not stay there? The city has more than 60 hotels and guesthouses.  Instead the pair chose a budget hotel in Bow, east London and travelled into Salisbury on the Saturday and Sunday of their visit. 3. Snowy weather complaints Ruslan Boshirov claimed: It was impossible to get anywhere because of the snow. We were drenched up to our knees. You would expect two middle-aged Russian men to be more hardy regarding the weather but the pictures paint a dferent story of this heavy snow.  The pair can be seen happily walking the streets with a little slush on the sides of the road. And temperature-wise the mercury was rising on Saturday March 3, the first day they visited. By Sunday it was a relatively balmy 9C. 4. Pair headed in entirely wrong direction after arriving in Salisbury  The spire of Salisbury Cathedral can be seen from the train station. There is no excuse, then, for Borishov and Petrov to set off in entirely the wrong direction with CCTV capturing them walking past a Shell garage, close to the Skripal family home. While there on Sunday Met Police say they smeared deadly Novichok on the door handle. 5. Lack of holiday snaps A trip from Moscow to Salisbury - just to visit a cathedral - is quite the extravagance. But the Russian pair have not presented any photographic evidence of their holiday, although they do claim to have photos. But no CCTV places them at the 800-year-old cathedral, nor there other claims that they also went to a park, we had some coffee. We went to a coffee shop and drank coffee.  The claim they visited Salisbury to see its cathedral doesn\u0027t seem to add up, the Wiltshire city\u0027s bishop has said. Bishop of Salisbury Nicholas Holtam said he was not aware of any evidence linking Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov to the cathedral, and suggested that the Russian men might have benefited from a visit to the building and a viewing of its copy of Magna Carta. 6. Stonehenge buses NOT cancelled Petrov said the pair also wanted to see nearby Stonehenge, but it didn\u0027t work out because of the slush. A bus runs to Stonehenge, nine miles north of Salisbury, every day starting from Salisbury train station forecourt. And buses were running on March 4. A spokesman for bus operator Salisbury Reds said: The tour buses ran as normal on Sunday 4 March.  7. Bad timing If one were to believe the extraordinary story of their transcontinental visit to see a cathedral it would be sheer coincidence that, on that day, the Skripal\u0027s both fell critically ill. CCTV shows the two walking in the direction of the Skripal\u0027s home the day that Sergei and his daughter Yulia became critically ill. A high amount of Novichok was found on their door handle and traces of the same substance - produced in Russia - was found in their hotel room.  After arriving in the city at 11.48am they were at their target\u0027s house within ten minutes. They were there for less than two hours. Boshirov admitted : Maybe we passed by it, maybe we didn\u0027t pass by it, I don\u0027t know, I hadn\u0027t heard. I hadn\u0027t heard this surname, I didn\u0027t know anything about them before this situation, this nightmare with us, started. 8. Two  flights Boshirov and Petrov did not explain why they booked two alternative  flights from London to Moscow - on Sunday or Monday. On Sunday they went direct from Salisbury to Heathrow for their evening flight. But on CCTV they did not even have any luggage with them. 9.

Like-for-like sales, which exclude new pubs, rose 5% in the 52 weeks to July 29. Revenue climbed 2% to \u0026pound1.69 billion, another all-time high.  Chairman Tim Martin said the current financial year had been reasonable, with 5.5% growth in like-for-like sales in the six weeks to September 9. But he warned higher running costs could threaten profit growth, saying: The company has had a reasonable start to the financial year, but taxes, labour and interest costs are expected to be higher than those of last year, so we estimate that like-for-like sales growth of about 4% will be required for the company to match last year\u0027s record profits. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing\u0027s share dealing service, said Martin\u0027s comments touched on the very real pressure facing pubs today. Claiming 50% of beer sales have been lost to supermarkets in the last 35 years, his calls for tax equality, with government treating pubs as leniently as supermarkets when it comes to tax, looks much needed, she said. Trade bodies and campaign groups including the Campaign for Real Ale, Wine and Spirits Trade Association and UK Hospitality have urged the Chancellor to freeze alcohol duty for a second year in a row to lessen the tax burden on pubs. JD Wetherspoon maintained its full year idend at 12p. Shares in the company were flat in early trading on Friday. Martin, an outspoken supporter of Brexit, said in a statement accompanying the results that there will be a huge gain for businesses and consumers  politicians opt for a free trade approach after leaving the EU.

The slow-moving storm crept toward the coastline, threatening millions of people in its path with record rainfall and punishing surf. Hurricane Florence weakened to a Category 1 storm late on Thursday night with little change in strength expected before it moves inland on Friday. Florence is about 60 miles  east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph , the Miami-based weather forecaster said.  The storm remained huge, unpredictable and potentially deadly ahead of its forecast landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, at mid-day on Friday. The centre of the storm is expected to hit North Carolina\u0027s southern coast Friday, then drt southwest before moving inland on Saturday. According to the National Hurricane Centre, this will allow enough time for almost 40 inches of rain to fall in some places.  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference that the historic hurricane would unleash rains and floods that would inundate almost the entire state in several feet of water. The sheer size of the storm meant it could batter the U.S. East Coast with hurricane-force winds for nearly a full day, according to weather forecasters. An estimated 10 million people live in the storm\u0027s path, according to the US Weather Prediction Center, and coastal businesses and homes were boarded up in anticipation this week. More than one million people were ordered to evacuate the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia and thousands moved to emergency shelters.  Florence\u0027s maximum sustained winds were clocked today at 105mph after it was downgraded to a Category 2 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the NHC. The winds had been as high as 140mph earlier in the week. Jeff Byard of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  warned residents the storm would bring a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast. Heed the warnings, Byard said.  Thursday The storm\u0027s centre was about 108 miles  east of Wilmington, North Carolina, at 3pm EDT but already some 19,000 homes and businesses were without power by mid-afternoon in the Carolinas and Virginia. Millions of people are expected to lose power from the storm and restoration could take weeks. The National Hurricane Centre also said the threat of tornadoes was increasing as Florence neared shore and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the heavy rains could trigger landslides in the western part of his state. Florence could bring wind-driven storm surges of seawater as high as 13 feet  and NHC Director Ken Graham said on Facebook they could push in as far as 2 miles .  Thursday 8pm Florence is expected to remain off the coast for the next few days, churning the coast with storm surge, high winds and flooding rainfall. Heavy rains were forecast to extend into the Appalachian Mountains, affecting parts of Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. Emergency declarations were in force in Georgia, South andNorth Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Near the beach in Wilmington, a Waffle House restaurant, part of a chain with a reputation for staying open during disasters, had no plans to = close, even  power is lost.  Friday 4am Florence has weakened to a Category 1 storm, with little change in strength expected before it moves inland later on Friday. Florence is about 60 miles  east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph , the Miami-based weather forecaster said. More signicant weakening was expected over the weekend and into early next week while Florence moves inland, the NHC said. Le-threatening storm surges and hurricane-force winds are occurring along the North Carolina coast, with the threat of freshwater flooding seen increasing over the next several days, it added. Friday 8am By Friday morning, the storm\u0027s wind speed is estimated to be around 100mph as the hurricane remains off the North Carolina coast. The storm, which is expected to be Category 2 by this time, will then start to drt left down the coast. It is unclear when or  it will make landfall. Some reports suggest it will remain in the ocean gathering strength by this stage.   Friday 11pm It\u0027s believed the storm will hover off the coast before making landfall. It\u0027s unusual for a hurricane to linger along a coastline and this could bring dire results as parts of the Carolinas could endure hurricane conditions for 24 hours. This will likely be the storm of a letime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that\u0027s saying a lot given the impacts we\u0027ve seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew, the National Weather Service in Wilmington, North Carolina said. The service also stressed the potential for “unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding with this storm.   Saturday 6am As it approaches the coast, it\u0027s estimated the wind speed will have reduced to less than 100mph. Florence is forecast to approach the South Carolina coast Saturday morning at 8 a.m. The storm could be reduced to a category 2 storm by the time it reaches land but this could result in an increase in rainfall to 40 inches in North Carolina. Florence is forecast to meander inland, slowly into South Carolina and could spend the weekend battering the Carolinas.

Evacuation warnings were in place for over a million people as the brutal storm landed, with winds of 90mph. Tens of thousands of homes were without power as sea water washed through towns and left people stranded.  Frightened residents and pets were saved by rescuers. Soldiers have been drafted in. The governor of the east coast state, Roy Cooper, said surviving the storm would be a test of “endurance, teamwork, common sense, and patience”. Officials warned it could still kill “a lot of people” and cause “catastrophic” flooding. The hurricane is expected to last for several days. North Carolina is likely to see eight months’ worth of rain in two to three days. An alarming interactive weather forecast did little to ease nerves.  The Weather Channel forecast left some viewers shocked as its presenter stood in the middle of computerised rising flood water, which had a car floating on its surface. She said: “When the storm surge reaches - this could be about to knock you off my feet and could be enough to float a parked car. This is extremely dangerous.

The Mirror watched in horror as the disturbed beast cried out, while its mate paced up and down the tiny cage in front of their bloodied and leless young. These are the sickening and distressing scenes at the world’s most vile attraction, Pyongyang Central Zoo in North Korea.Jong-un personally ordered for millions to be spent on upgrading facilities in 2016, requesting that a huge model tiger’s head be installed at the entrance.  Our zoo guide excitedly told us: “Our Supreme Leader said the tiger was the symbol of bravery and courage and loved by all Korean people.” But despite the dictator’s words, little comfort or compassion is afforded to the defenceless animals kept here. Welfare experts reacted in complete disbelief after being shown the conditions, where animals suffer every day after being captured from around the globe and gted to the North Korean leaders. Jong-un has also told of his love of the deadly snakes in the reptile enclosure, where we saw more scenes of cruelty. Elsewhere we witnessed many \u0026shytraumatised animals with their heads wedged into the corners of their tiny enclosures, and crocodiles kept in barely two feet of water.  Rare green and loggerhead turtles swam in an algae-covered tank, which looked as though it had not been cleaned since former North Korea dictator Kim Jong-il “gted” them to the zoo in 2001. Some of the huge turtles, apparently favoured by Jong-un, were seen being manhandled by a callous keeper, who grabbed them by their tails and tossed them into a putrid pool. On the other side of the park, a dozen seals packed into a tiny enclosure wailed with stress, a lion roared in torment while staring into the corner of his tiny cage, and a malnourished Bengal tiger paced maniacally. Experts said all of them were showing “classic signs of torment” and last night described the attraction as “one of the worst cases of psychological abuse of animals ever seen”.  Despite the large plot, with huge grounds and towering exhibition buildings – including a natural history museum with models of dinosaurs – we saw only two zookeepers during our two-hour trip with our Korean minders, who thought nothing of the tragic conditions. One told us how Jong-un had visited the reptile exhibition in May 2016 and remarked how he loved the snakes for being “the symbol of longevity in le”. The Mirror spent eight days in the hermit kingdom, where repressive despot Jong-un rules with an iron fist.  We yesterday exposed the startling dference between the gleaming capital city Pyongyang, home to three million of the “elite”, and the desolate country\u0026shyside, where some 20 million farm workers scratch out an existence. And we showed how citizens \u0026shyslavishly consume the propaganda-fuelled rhetoric constantly pumped out by Jong-un and his cronies, while the country is battered by some of the world’s harshest sanctions. Our probe proves Jong-un’s regime thinks nothing of spending millions on creating a dystopian image of perfection while abandoning basic values and rights for humans and animals. Dr Chris Draper, head of welfare at animal rights organisation Born Free Foundation, said the zoo was “totally inappropriate” for all the animals.  He said: “Their cages are small, bare and there is no means of retreat from public view for them. It is most alarming to see the mother [tiger] and stillborn cub. There should’ve been a vet on the scene straight away. “There should have been intervention prior to this horrendous situation and, at the very least, immediate action should have been taken after the birth to establish why it occurred.” Humane Society International’s Wendy Higgins said: “This is a devastating, rare insight into the shockingly poor existence of animals at this zoo. [They] are confined to heartbreakingly small enclosures, often almost entirely barren, in which all they can do is pace or swim the same circular route. “Tigers, lions, sea lions and turtles all have complex, specic environmental needs that are essential for their mental and physical well-being, and here we have a classic example of a facility that meets virtually none of those needs.  “It’s little wonder that we see big cats here demonstrating stereotypical repetitive cage pacing, classic signs of mental distress as the animals struggle to cope with the monotony and deprivation. “This kind of zoo teaches nothing of the true nature of these animals because they exist as mere shadows of themselves.” More heartbreaking scenes came as groups of school\u0026shychildren looked at the exhibits. They were often encouraged by their teachers to clap and shout at the animals to get their attention – one of the worst things for a captive animal’s mental wellbeing, experts said. A red-eared turtle, which we were told had special signicance in Korea as it brought healing properties, lay in a small puddle of putrid water.  It had so little liquid that its tiny head popped out from the surface as it lay on the floor. The conditions were so awful that algae had grown on its shell, weighing down its tiny frame. The desperate scene was at complete odds with a fable our guide told us, in which the animal was so respected for its amazing qualities that an army of 200,000 men had been instructed to find and take care of it. The zoo was opened in 1959 by Kim Il-sung, Jong-un’s grandfather and the original Supreme Leader.  The Kim dynasty has continued each one’s obsession with capturing animals, with Il-sung visiting 20 times, his son Kim Jong-Il 31 times and current leader Jong-un six times. However, their interest has done nothing for the welfare of the animals.  One roof for tourists and dignitaries During our eight-day stay, we were ordered to stay at a hotel on an island and warned we could not leave without our government minders. The Yanggakdo Hotel is accessed by a bridge over the Taedong River, just outside the centre of Pyongyang. Dignitaries and foreign tourists are also put there. We watched as specially invited North Korea “friend\u0026shyship” delegations arrived in time for last Sunday’s military parade and Mass Games. We were bundled into a lt with controversial French actor Gerard Depardieu, a dubious guest of honour at the nation’s 70th anniversary foundation celebrations.

I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out.

The uncertainty and upheaval is causing upset.”Councillor Dave Doogan, an elected representative for the area, is working to find a long-term solution.He said: “The situation with the centre is extremely disappointing.“Structural engineers have found flaws in the building and have advised closure.“It’s possible a heavy fall of snow could seriously impair the building’s roof.“In the interests of safety, the building will have to come down.“There is no point in having it still in use as we have to consider the safety of people.“I am now doing all I can to find permanent other accommodation for the pensioners who will meet at the Christian centre in the interim.”Mr Doogan revealed that the faults found in the centre were discovered when the council decided to have all its properties inspected in the wake of the wall collapse at Edinburgh’s Liberton High School in which a schoolgirl was killed.He said: “All council buildings were inspected and that was when the Fairfield Centre problem was detected.“It is unfortunate as the building was well used by a number of groups over a number of years.“I appreciate how dficult it is for groups such as these pensioners to find a suitable place nearby to hold their regular get-togethers.”A council spokesman said: “Since we became aware of these issues, the council has been working with all groups which use the centre, and they have all been found alternative premises.“The building will be made secure until January, when it will be demolished. This will take until March.“The council is considering the best future use for the site.”Councillor Murray Lyle said: “It is sad to say goodbye to Fairfield, but the important thing is to keep people safe.“Thankfully, we have been able to rehome user groups elsewhere.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ray mckinnon dundee tried to punt ex captain darren odea to falkirk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Falkirk manager Ray McKinnon has revealed the deadline day madness at the Championship strugglers – and even had a Dundee defender offered to him with just minutes to go till the window slammed shut.The former Dundee United boss was only in the door for a few hours after his shock switch from Greenock Morton.McKinnon managed to seal a deal for Rangers striker Zak Rudden on loan but narrowly missed out on former Tannadice loanee Anthony Ralston.He also revealed Dundee boss Neil McCann offered the services of former skipper Darren O’Dea as the clock ticked towards midnight.McKinnon said: “We had Darren O’Dea getting punted to us at 10.30 at night by Neil McCann.

There is no option to retain services at St Andrews or Glenrothes.Local people can attend meetings at Waid Community Campus, Anstruther, on Thursday and in St Andrews Town Hall on September 24, both at 6.45pm.Mr Rennie said: “Everybody I have spoken to has expressed a clear view it should not happen and there is a growing anger.”Fe Health and Social Care Partnership director Michael Kellet said there had been no option. “Fe is experiencing the impact of shortages of key staff,” he said.“In response we have put in place the contingency measures to ensure a safe and reliable service.

the north","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the early-season jockeying for position continues in a Championship that’s, so far, living up to predictions it will be the tightest for years, Dundee United can do themselves a lot of good by winning their next two games.Even  the last league outing ended in the minor disappointment of a draw at Alloa, there’s no denying, since their early-campaign troubles in the Betfred Cup, the past few weeks have seen the Tangerines show steady signs of improvement.The last three outings have produced two wins plus that draw and, in a ision where after just four rounds of fixtures only one team, Inverness Caley Thistle, remains unbeaten, that can be put down as a decent run of form.And,  United can extend that to five games without loss via victories over Morton at Tannadice this Saturday and at Falkirk a week later, there’s every chance they’ll be the form team in the second tier.If that is so, it would be a case of good timing because at least two of the three games that will follow could prove to be among the most crucial of the campaign.That run will see them come up against both Inverness and Ross County and, as tight as the table looks just now, it is signicant the Highland pair currently occupy the top two positions.Coming down from the Premiership and with the backing of mega-rich owner Roy McGregor, County were always expected to mount a strong challenge to  to the top flight.It’s been a case of so far so good, though they did go down 2-1 at Morton last time out in the league.And before arriving at Tannadice on the 29th of this month, their quality will be further tested by a visit to in-form Queen of the South this weekend and a derby against Inverness the following week.That the team from the Highland capital are also looking strong will come as no surprise to those who know the Championship.Although they didn’t even make the promotion play-offs last term, many at that level felt between Christmas and the end of the season Caley were the strongest of the 10 teams.They’re coming to Tannadice in just over a month, almost exactly a year to the day since their impressive victory would mark the end of Ray McKinnon’s time in charge of the home team. While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a dficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see  that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the ision.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but,  it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie

Additional allowances are also paid for summer holidays, Christmas and birthdays.Foster carers do not have to own their own home and do not need to be married. They can also be single or living with someone, including in a same-sex relationship.

It has been handed in to the council.A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBTI forum, which is organising the rally, said Mr Morrison was entitled to his opinions,\"I have no problem with him or the people who have signed the petition holding their views and I totally respect that but there are a lot of other people who don\u0026rsquot hold those views,\" she said.\"You will always get people who don\u0026rsquot like LGBT stuff.\"Referring to his comments about people frolicking on rainbow-coloured floats, she said: \"Basically this is a celebration and  he doesn\u0026rsquot like people dancing and enjoying themselves, I could see that would be a problem for him.\"She said there was nothing illegal about the proposed parade.\"Obviously, nothing untoward will be happening during the march,\" she said. \"It will be totally family-friendly.\"He has a moral objection which is his personal objection and he is perfectly entitled to that.

This removes any perceived conflict where the match official is placed in the position of reassessing their original decision.\u0026nbsp“Instead the Compliance Officer asks a three-person panel to review whether a sending off offence occurred.

It is completely separate and distinct to the Judicial Panel itself who are tasked with reviewing Notices of Complaint and Fast Track Claims. The Judicial Panel is made up of people from across the game.\u0026nbsp“The overall changes introduced this summer were the subject of discussion and input from two separate working groups comprising representatives from across Scottish football, including clubs, managers and players who met on numerous occasions to discuss and agree to these changes to the Protocol.\u0026nbsp“The SPFL Competitions Working Group, which includes representation from all four leagues, were also consulted during the process. Systems used across other national associations, including the FA, were considered as part of the process, and influenced the recommended approach.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identication. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

A second-to-none platform at the cutting edge of technology that quickly reaches the best, relevant candidates via Google Jobs, social media, email and the fantastic HIJOBS app.What are you waiting for?

It is a place precious to many who come to seek solitude and appreciate the remote and beautul landscape. It is impossible to mitigate the visual impact. Its presence alone would remove the wilderness and scenic qualities valued by many.\u0026#8217The area is designated ‘Wild Land’ and ‘Area of Panoramic Quality’ and lies within the Inner Hebrides and The Minches Special Area of Conservation , she said, and is \u0026#8216rich in rare wildle\u0026#8217, such as harbour porpoises, dolphins, and minke, killer and sei whales.\u0026#8216The plan shows Acoustic Deterrent Devices  would be used to deter seals. Cetaceans can be displaced by ADDs at ranges of 7km. The cumulative impact will be devastating to these species.\u0026#8216Impacts from lice, disease, pesticides and waste, to not only wild fish, but other marine le is unacceptable. The estates on Islay and Jura work hard to conserve and enhance their local native populations.\u0026#8216The proposal is flawed: there has been no consideration to the exposed nature of the site and the high potential for escaped stock and mooring instability of the cages.\u0026#8216There has been no hydrodynamic modelling, no benthic  biology survey submitted, maximum stocking biomass has been increased to levels for which further investigations are needed and fallow periods are unsustainably short. Impacts to other wildle have not been considered.\u0026#8216A promise of six jobs, whilst sacricing a rare wild landscape and unspoiled marine habitats, is not appropriate nor sustainable economic development.\u0026#8217Stuart Cannon, managing director of Kames Fish Farming Limited, said it is \u0026#8216an environmentally responsible company which has produced high quality, sustainable fish for more than 45 years.\u0026#8216We are very much aware there is a balance to be struck, and would not want to place a site where there would be risk to the amazing bioersity we have on the west coast.\u0026#8216We have withdrawn applications in the past where the scientic assessment of the site has suggested the site is not suitable.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cakes and coffee make a zambian difference","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/09/18, 3:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowZamScotEd, the Mid Argyll-based charity that supports education in Zambia, is close to achieving three of the UN’s sustainable development goals in Lusaka, where its secondary school is steadily growing.If you pop in to ZamScotEd’s next coffee morning in Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall, you will help to put the icing on the cake of St Columba’s third classroom block – the science building that will enable pupils to forge ahead and gain qualications to work in their country’s industries and professions.ZamScotEd founder, Marian Pallister, was back in Zambia this summer to check on the progress of the much needed secondary school the organisation initiated in one of the poorest communities on the fringe of Lusaka.She said: \u0026#8216Progress has been amazing.

MTV will provide a DJ for the night and all revellers have to do is turn up and get their groove on. Furys manager Steven Muir said: “MTV are doing a freshers’ tour for filming and they asked  we want to be part of it. “They were targeting big university cities and some towns. “They picked us as they had seen we won the nightclub award and UWS had grown in stature.” Steven said Furys is getting bigger and better and they are delighted to be selected as one of the clubs to be filmed.  He added: “MTV film the night and it will be aired later on in the spring on the Club MTV chance. “This is the people of Ayr’s chance to get on TV, so what we have done is ask that people come dressed smart and show off the town. “It will just be a normal night in Furys, and they asked to do it on one of our iconic nights. “So Skints on a Thursday was chosen, as that’s a busy night for students and has been running for about 10 years. “We sold out all the booths within a few hours of advertising, and the tickets are flying off the shelves. “I am advising everyone to get tickets soon, as this will no doubt be a full house.” The event occurs on Thursday, October 4 at Furys Nightclub on Nile Court.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service .\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of le, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved quickly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wallace-or-scott-selkirk-to-decide-on-new-signs","story":"PLANS are being drawn up for new tourism signage at Selkirk\u0026rsquos four main entrances \u0026ndash

urgent call was made at the beginning of July to collect the money in just two months.\nAnd on Thursday, August 30, thanks to the efforts of hundreds of people, companies in Tweeddale and many other local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer  members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again ening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that le is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing  we measure it by days passed.  Yet  we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long le, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of le. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo le shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our le.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my le \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as  it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautul warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your le, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnicent and beautul? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in dferent ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered  everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I ed I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautul or special.  We can pepper our daily le with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you  ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"deal-over-land-for-new-prestonpans-cemetery-in-final-stages","story":"  The local authority has confirmed it is close to securing a deal for land in the town to ease the pressure on Prestonpans Cemetery, which is nearly full.

Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked  it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-shuts-suddenly","story":"  The County Hotel, run since 2016 by Tony Breathnach, has been shut since last Thursday.\u0026nbsp  The 10-bedroom High Street hotel, which also includes a bar and dining area, was leased to Mr Breathnach by Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars, part of Heineken UK.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.

He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.

Filmed over the summer in Glasgow, the show sees five contestants begin the game with a case containing a secret amount of cash. Players answer questions to win visits to a soundproof vault where they can see inside their opponents\u0026rsquo cases. The twist: they don\u0026rsquot know how much is in their own case.  In a fast-paced endgame, players attempt to steal each other\u0026rsquos cases via tense head-to-head challenges, but only the player who gets over the finish line first will win what is inside their case. There is a potential jackpot of \u0026pound5,000.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos totally dferent to other game shows, Debs told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a good bit of comedy in it, which is why I\u0026rsquom there.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot speak, it\u0026rsquos all just done with my eyes and facial expressions.

The stage is nothing new for the former Centre Stage director. She left the theatre group in 2016 to give herself \u0026ldquoa wee chance and still acts in local productions.  She now runs Quirky Pond, a theatre company, with friend Yvonne Rowley.

Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated.

It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My we Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my we woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My we was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"a-new-beginning-for-dundee","story":"  August and the sun is shining. Down at the city\u0026rsquos waterfront, outside the new Sleeperz hotel, next to the revamped train station entrance, a group of Japanese tourists are sitting on the large sculpted pebbles that dot the forecourt. A new office block is under construction across the street and in Slessor Gardens there\u0026rsquos a women\u0026rsquos yoga class going en plein air  Not so very long ago this was all concrete and tarmac round here. Now everything has changed. And the change is spreading beyond the waterfront too. In the streets around and behind the Malmaison hotel you can find a smattering of new shops, delis and vegan cafes .  And this in a city that only two years ago was seen as an entrepreneurial black spot. In 2015 the Courier reported that in there had been only 48 applications for grants to StartUp Britain in the previous three years. Now Dundee appears to be open for business.  This is the new face of the city. But it\u0026rsquos down at the waterfront that you will see its most visible manestation.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee, which opens today, is the reason that, for the first time in many years you might say, the city is suddenly hip, \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos coolest city, according to the Wall Street Journal. Vogue has also been singing the city\u0026rsquos praises.  The changes are being noticed by locals too. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see more restaurants, shops, fashion labels launching, says fashion designer Hayley Scanlan, herself a Dundee native. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos so much happening. Young people are doing their own thing. It\u0026rsquos amazing and inspirational. People have had the guts to do stuff because they can see there is an opportunity.  The prospect of the V\u0026ampA Dundee, she says, has \u0026ldquobrought light to the city.  And yet there are still shadows. Some of them are the shadows that every modern city contends with. Things like the death of the high street for one.   Other shadows are darker. It was revealed earlier this year that one in four children in the city live in poverty.  This is a city that has suffered as much as any in the post-industrial age with widescale loss of jobs . And in some families unemployment has become generational.  Suspicions about the hype and hope that surrounds Dundee at the moment is perhaps to some extent understandable After all Dundee has had more than its unfair share of failed regenerations in the past. The new museum sits on one of them. Once the city\u0026rsquos dock, it was torn up in the 1960s \u0026ndash including an arch built to commemorate the visit of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to the city in the 19th century \u0026ndash to create slip roads off the bridge.  Still, the V\u0026ampA Dundee is part of the city\u0026rsquos attempt to rewrite a reputation that has for years \u0026ndash maybe even decades - been written off.  The question is how did we get here? What has allowed this to happen and what might it lead to?  Few people are better equipped to answer all of this than Mike Galloway. Galloway grew up in Glasgow and Perth  and, after a successful career in urban planning in Glasgow where he worked on the regeneration of the Merchant City and the Gorbals, he became Dundee\u0026rsquos Director of City Planning in 1997.  Today, sitting on the top floor of Dundee House looking out over the Tay Estuary, he is remembering the city he found 21 years ago.  \u0026ldquoIts image was extremely poor he recalls. \u0026ldquoReally poor. Its self-image was really poor. Dundonians did not regard their city very highly.  They were not the only ones. When he told colleagues in Glasgow he was moving to Dundee they thought he was crazy. \u0026ldquoThey thought it was a coffin job, he admits.  \u0026ldquoWe were losing population hand over fist and  that continued the whole infrastructure of the city was under threat.  But when he applied for the job, he says, there were already signs that Dundee wanted things to change.  \u0026ldquoWhat I found was a city that was really determined to reinvent itself. There was a whole campaign to put the heart back into the city, to try to recover Dundee\u0026rsquos reputation, its image, to try and recapture its retail catchment area, for example. It was on the verge.  \u0026ldquoThere was an effort to restructure the economy away from manufacturing to knowledge-based. Back in the mid-1990s that was very dangerous, very Avant Garde, particularly for a strong Labour council to be proposing that.  In a way that sense of incipient change was what drew him here. He\u0026rsquod first lived in Dundee was a student in the mid-1970s, and a couple of decades later, he ed for a joint 40th birthday party with his we.\u0026nbsp  Walking around the city that weekend he was impressed by the changes from the city he knew 20 years earlier. A few weeks later he saw the ad in the paper for his job and he applied. \u0026ldquoI tell the story that I came to Dundee for a party and I never left, he says, smiling.  It was a good time to come, he says. Things were changing. Within two years the DCA would open, giving the city\u0026rsquos image a boost. The universities were beginning to help establish the city\u0026rsquos reputation as a centre of design . In some areas the city was on an upswing.  That didn\u0026rsquot mean more changes weren\u0026rsquot needed. \u0026ldquoThe one place that really let the city down was the waterfront, where the Tay Bridge came in and joined in the city centre, recalls Galloway. It was just a morass of motorways, bridges, brutalist buildings. And yet that was Dundee\u0026rsquos front door. That\u0026rsquos where you arrived, whether by train or by car. That was your first impression and first impressions stick.  His solution, complete redevelopment of the waterfront. A project with a timeframe that stretched to decades. Urban regeneration is rarely a quick fix. That redevelopment has been a priority for the city ever since.  There were strokes of good fortune along the way. Dundee was able to benefit from the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Cities Growth Fund. It made the decision to channel all that money into the waterfront. The city also managed to tap funds from Scottish Enterprise and did the same with it.  And all of this, it should be noted, has been done over the last decade in the teeth of recession.  \u0026ldquoBut in some ways that was an advantage, suggests Galloway. \u0026ldquoBecause we got really keen prices. The fact that there wasn\u0026rsquot a buoyant development market out there wasn\u0026rsquot problematic. We got good prices. We got really committed contractors to work with because there was a dearth of business for them elsewhere.  The idea of a museum on the waterfront wasn\u0026rsquot part of the original masterplan. But, Galloway says, they were looking for a big idea. That big idea arrived over food in 2007.  Early that year Sir Mark Jones, the then director of the V\u0026ampA museum, was in Dundee to have a look at what was going on at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design. The college laid on a lunch for him and invited a selection of guests from the city. Galloway was one of them.  \u0026ldquoThe \u0026lsquoBilbao effect\u0026rsquo was very big at the time, Galloway recalls, referring to the impact Frank Gehry\u0026rsquos Guggenheim museum had on the economy of the northern Spanish city. \u0026ldquoWe were explaining to him what we\u0026rsquore doing on the waterfront here and he was interested, so we said: \u0026lsquoLook, before you get your flight back can we show you around?\u0026rsquo  Jones said yes. A few days later he called Galloway and said he\u0026rsquod like to continue the conversation. The idea of V\u0026ampA Dundee was in utero.  The story of the building of Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos design is a saga in itself, a story of reigning in the original ambition and an inflationary budget   This week another argument emerged when Chrissie Hynde, of all people, moaned about the office block being built just across the road from the museum, calling it a \u0026ldquomonstrosity which should be torn down.  Galloway argues that it is part of the change that Dundee needs. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is an anchor building in the waterfront development that will encourage tourists and business tourists . But it can\u0026rsquot stand alone.  Right now, though, the museum itself is an opportunity to change the city\u0026rsquos image. Philip Long, the V\u0026ampA Dundee director, suggests that, in fact, it\u0026rsquos already happening. \u0026ldquoThe city is reclaiming its waterfront and it has had the ambition to go out and award the most amazing building project to Kengo Kuma which is now not just being used to portray Dundee but is being used in the Scotland Now campaign. So, the city is being understood in dferent ways.  The interest from Vogue and the Wall Street Journal would suggest as much.  But just how far does that understanding go in the city itself?  On Dundee\u0026rsquos Whitfield estate in the north of the city, tucked in behind a low-rise office block there is a garden of remembrance. At the entrance of this \u0026ldquoGarden of Hope row upon row of brass tags hang on the fence. On each is inscribed a message of love and loss.  Barrie, 51, is a service manager with Addaction, a national charity set up to help those suffering from dependency issues. Every day he meets with drug addicts and their families in the area and offers support and comfort.  \u0026ldquoWhat we are trying to do is create a place where people can come together and support one another and also try and heal a little bit, he explains  There is a lot of healing to be done. Last year Dundee took over from Glasgow as the city with the highest number of drug deaths per resident in the country .  Barrie is all too aware of the impact those deaths can have on family members and friends. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom supporting one family that has lost three sons to overdoses, he says. We\u0026rsquore hearing about eight-year-old girls who are self-harming after losing their mums to drugs.  \u0026ldquoThere was a guy in this morning who has lost about a dozen close people to drug death. If you\u0026rsquore coping with that level of loss on top of your own issues it\u0026rsquos hard and drugs and alcohol, as we know, are a way of coping for a lot of people. It\u0026rsquos not a good way. It\u0026rsquos a very dangerous way.  Drug deaths, Barrie suggests, is harder to talk about than cancer. There is a huge stigma involved.  But over and above everything else, he says, poverty is the major contributory factory. Last year it was revealed that in the previous five years Dundee had more benefit sanctions applied than anywhere else in the country.  \u0026ldquoSo, masses of this will be to do with poverty and lack of aspiration or lack of choices, Barrie suggests. \u0026ldquoYou put it all together we\u0026rsquore at the head of a storm.  It only takes a few minutes to drive from the waterfront to Whitfield but at times the distance must seem huge.  Barrie himself is excited about the museum opening and about taking some of his clients to see it. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a fantastic opportunity for Dundee. I get goose bumps even thinking about it.  But he also worries that it might have an alienating effect on those he works with. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom wondering  the V\u0026ampA is almost reinforcing the hopelessness in a weird way. It\u0026rsquos so beautul, so perfect \u0026hellip If your le is the opposite of that \u0026hellip \u0026ldquo  It\u0026rsquos something that concerns Hayley Scanlan too. \u0026ldquoI just think all this hope is being put into this one thing and are people going to be disappointed? What is the backlash going to be?  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the old analogy that when the tide comes in all the boats rise, says Galloway. \u0026ldquoThe problem in cities like Dundee is that some of the boats are chained to the bottom and they\u0026rsquore not going to benefit unless we do something specically to make it happen.  \u0026ldquoOne of the key challenges I\u0026rsquove been given by the council and politicians is to ensure the waterfront has meaning in terms of jobs and income for everybody in the city. So, the fact that we\u0026rsquove committed to the living wage in the waterfront is not the usual sticker badge in it. It\u0026rsquos genuine.  When Sleeperz came to Dundee wanting to operate the hotel at the waterfront, Galloway explains, the city told the hoteliers they would have to pay the living wage. They were initially reticent because of the cost and the precedent. But in tandem with the council they found a workaround and now the company is going to introduce the living wage in all its hotels.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos through that kind of activity that we are much more likely to have a waterfront and things in that waterfront that really mean something to people in Whitfield and all of the communities across the city.  Philip Long believes it would be wrong to suggest that the V\u0026ampA Dundee is some kind of panacea for all of the city\u0026rsquos issues. It can help with economic investment, he says, \u0026ldquobut we\u0026rsquore only part of everything else that is going on.  What it does offer, he adds, is a facility that can help make a dference to people\u0026rsquos lives in the city, whether that is through employment or even just inspiration.  And people are being inspired. Dundee is changing. Hayley Scanlan is a walking example of that. There would have been a time, she admits, when she would have had to move away to be able to establish her fashion label. But the internet has changed all that and Scanlan, 35, has been able to build her business and raise twin boys in the city of her birth.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a supportive place. I have a huge support network in Dundee. I opened the shop a year and a half ago and it\u0026rsquos just been unbelievable. Seeing strangers walking down the street wearing my clothes \u0026hellip I can\u0026rsquot even put it into words.  Today the V\u0026ampA Dundee opens. Next month, Mike Galloway retires. It\u0026rsquos time to hand on the reins to someone else, he says. Walking me back to the elevator, he points down the estuary where three oil rigs can be seen. \u0026ldquoWe started looking at decommissioning a couple of years ago and we got laughed at. Now we\u0026rsquove got some major companies looking to base themselves in Dundee for this emerging new industry.  For Galloway this is a new beginning for Dundee. This is a city with problems, some of them huge and grievous, but progress is being made. In the future the city will look dferent, will be more confident, erse and complex, he hopes.  If so, that will bring its own problems of course, Galloway admits.  \u0026ldquoIt will be interesting 20 years from now to see  people are moaning about the number of tourists."},{"url":null,"title":"russians-claiming-to-be-salisbury-suspects-say-they-were-just-tourists","story":"  The men, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, appeared on the Russia state-funded RT channel and resembled the suspects shown on CCTV stills, which were released by police investigating the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, the former Russian spy, and his daughter Yulia.  They claimed they were now victims and were in fear of their lives.  Petrov said: \u0026ldquoOur friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town.  He went on: \"Well, we went there on March 2, then went to a railway station to see the timetable. We arrived in Salisbury on March 3 and tried to walk through the town but we lasted for only half an hour because it was covered in snow.  \"Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn\u0027t do it because there was muddy slush everywhere. The town was covered by this slush. We got wet, took the nearest train and came back [to London].\"  Boshirov said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos the famous Salisbury Cathedral, famous not just in Europe, but in the whole world. It\u0026rsquos famous for its 123-metre spire, it\u0026rsquos famous for its clock, the first one[of its kind] ever created in the world, which is still working.  \"We spent no more than an hour in Salisbury, mainly because of the lags between trains. Maybe we did[approach] Skripal\u0027s house but we don\u0027t know where it\u0026rsquos located.\"  He claimed his le had been turned \"upside down\" and added: \"We\u0027re afraid of going out, we fear for ourselves, our lives and lives of our loved ones.\"  The two men denied transporting the Novichok nerve agent.  When asked by RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan whether they had a counterfeit bottle of designer perfume, which the police said contained the nerve agent, Borishov replied: \"Is it silly for decent lads to have women\u0027s perfume? The customs are checking everything, they would have questions as to why men have women\u0027s perfume in their luggage. We didn\u0027t have it.\"  The men\u0026rsquos comments were published on RT\u0026rsquos webpage. The station said it would air more of the interview later. Ms Simonyan made clear the two men, \u0026ldquothe real  Petrov and Boshirov, had contacted her offering an interview.  On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin called for the two men to speak with the media during an economic conference in Vlaostok. The Russian President insisted they were innocent and \u0026ldquocivilians, contradicting accusations by Scotland Yard that they were agents of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, which Mr Skripal used to be a member of.  Asked about the RT interview, Downing St declined to give any new comment.  Detectives believe it is likely the two Salisbury suspects, thought to be aged around 40, travelled under aliases and that Petrov and Boshirov are not their real names.  Officers formally linked the attack on the Skripals to events in nearby Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, were exposed to the same nerve agent.  Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July, just over a week after the pair fell ill.  A police officer who visited the home of the Skripals shortly after the attack, Nick Bailey, was also left critically ill from exposure to the substance."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee-hopes-for-private-sector-boost-for-conference-centre-plan","story":"  The city\u0027s council wants to build the facility with the signicant aid of business support as part of the \u0026pound1bn regeneration of its water front.  Mike Galloway, the executive director of city development at Dundee City Council has said the city wanted to maintain a momentum of development in the city after the opening, this weekend, of the \u0026pound80m museum.  A spokesperson for Dundee City Council said: \"Conference and events tourism is already an important contributor to our local economy, and presents an opportunity for further growth.  \"We are speaking to a number of private sector parties about how this could be taken forward.\"  : Will the V\u0026ampA Dundee be a success?  The council is hoping to build on what it hopes will be an influx of visitors to the city due to the opening of the museum.  The city has seen overnight stays in hotels rise by more than 9.8% in the year up to April.  However, public money will not be the major finance for the centre: the council is already invested in the V\u0026ampA.  The leader of Dundee\u0027s City Council, John Alexander, said he expected the V\u0026ampA to have a huge effect on the city.  He said: \"When you consider the journey the city has been on for a number of years, and the success that we have gathered and brought to Dundee - all of that is bringing real tangible benefits, even in visitor numbers before the new institution is opened.  \"I think our hopes for the museum\u0027s [visitor figures] are realistic.\"  : The V\u0026ampA Dundee and hopes to draw 500,000 visitors  Speaking at the new museum, he added: \"There is a renewed confidence, a renewed pride, there is a fire in the belly of ordinary Dundonians that wasn\u0027t there ten years ago.  \"For too long the city was seen as a poor relation to our larger neighbouring cities, but that is no longer the case.  \"Dundee is leading the charge for a culture-led regeneration.\"  Reports suggest the city is looking at the concept of an indoor complex close to the city centre to host concerts and conferences for up to 6,000 people.  Dundee\u0027s biggest venue is currently Caird Hall with a capacity of 2,300.  Mr Galloway said: \"There is definitely a gap in the market in Dundee for an indoor events arena that could double up as a conference and convention facility as well.  \"We\u0027re not looking at anything huge which would directly compete with existing arenas in Aberdeen and Glasgow - it has to be the right facility that fits into our market and I\u0027d really want it to be close to the city centre.\"  : Inside the V\u0026ampA Dundee  City council leader John Alexander said plans were under way for Dundee to host a major arts festival in four years\u0027 time.  Dundee lost out on UK City of Culture 2017 to Hull and the vote to leave the EU scuppered its bid to become European Capital of Culture 2023.  The festival would last six to eight days and take place in 2022.  Mr Alexander said: \"We have been working on proposals and I personally attended the Unesco Creative Cities conference in Poland in June and represented and promoted our ambition.  \"It will provide a shopfront, a showcase of culture across every Unesco network. It will encompass literature, music, gastronomy and all of the other designations.  \"We have made that offer to Unesco, we have the backing of the Scottish Government and the UK ambassador to Unesco and I have also met with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.  \"We are now actively working on these proposals and are working to deliver them in 2022.\""},{"url":null,"title":"what-can-we-do-about-the-scourge-of-jobsworths","story":"  I\u0026rsquove been trying to cut down recently so it was going to be a treat.

I wasn\u0026rsquot after a cup of tea and certainly not for \u0026pound1.80.  \u0026ldquoYou could go along the street to the cash machine. I had a taxi on the way and not much time.  So, my coffee was lost for want of a 2p piece.  I did eight years\u0027 labour in a coffee shop and I can tell you this much, I would have made the 2p up.  \u0026ldquoJobsworth, I whined to the taxi driver, all the way back to work in a funk.  My barista jobsworth absolutely pales in comparison to the hard graft put in by a manager of a Toby Carvery who denied a terminally ill woman a small plate.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos right. The rules of a chain roast dinner restaurant are sacrosanct. One must take what one is given and be glad, even when one is dying.  A woman in Merseyside visited her local Toby Carvery and asked for a child\u0026rsquos plate. Lynn Deer has terminal stomach cancer, resulting in most of the organ being removed. She hasn\u0026rsquot, you\u0026rsquoll sympathise, much of an appetite.  Child\u0026rsquos plates are for the under-12s and there will be no exceptions. She tried to show the manager a medical card but the lady in charge was not for turning. I tell you what, I didn\u0026rsquot expect to spend my Wednesday afternoon in a minor Twitter spat with Toby Carvery but the chain\u0026rsquos pathetic, mealy-mouthed non-apology left me seeing red. They appreciate my feedback.  Jobsworths are the scourge of polite society. What can we do about them?  In this instance, staff cannot be taught empathy but they can have disability awareness drummed into them, so let\u0026rsquos hope\u0026nbspsome staff training is afoot.  Good customer service matters so much because bad service is to steal someone\u0026rsquos time. It\u0026rsquos a mini manslaughter \u0026ndash who among us has time to give away? You are taking a little piece of someone else\u0026rsquos le.  Ma Stewart was a bit stressed about catching her train the other week and, because of her hearing loss, didn\u0026rsquot realise she was shouting at the station staff member.  Instead of taking umbrage, the ScotRail worker helped her through the barrier, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquoYou go with her, allowing me on to the platform without a ticket and without me having even asked.  What a dference it made, that small, thoughtful gesture.  We have an increasingly elderly population, a society that is increasingly moving online. It seems odd to me that my older neighbour won\u0026rsquot set up a direct debit for his council tax but, on reflection, it\u0026rsquos a day out to pay it in person with guaranteed human interaction.  Imagine that you\u0026rsquore a person\u0026rsquos only face-to-face connection that day and you make them feel bad, you rattle them, you deprive them of something they were excited for.  This all resonates so much because I was once that jobsworth. Back in my coffee shop days, while I\u0026rsquod have let you off with coppers, I was as compliant with company policy as they come.  We\u0026rsquod been told not to give cream in coffee because it curdled. I mean, it doesn\u0026rsquot, does it? But what I was told, I believed.  Every morning the back of 6am a taxi driver would come in for his coffee with cream. Would I give him it? Would I coco.  When he insisted, I would give him a cup with an 80/20 split \u0026ndash in favour of the cream.  I shudder now to think of how he must have dreaded to see me. An irritating little madam setting his day off to a tense and fat-laden start. I am filled with shame.  I saw him not that long ago on Sauchiehall Street and wanted to chase after him to apologise. Of course, that would have been awkward for him and serve only selfish me.  So what changed? Maturity, mainly. But for many jobsworths, age is no excuse.  How to encourage everyday kindness to strangers? I think it starts small and spreads, as mawkish as that may sound. Send it out in waves, each little act at a time.  But it\u0026rsquos vital to go in at the top. Our current insecure labour market does nothing for the discouragement of jobsworths. The pressure is twofold:  your work is precarious, why care? And  you\u0026rsquore at risk of a short term contract being renewed, there\u0026rsquos no incentive to risk using your initiative and overriding company policy.  So, be kind, complain and compliment. Be kind to staff but complain furiously to companies that implement ridiculous policies. And compliment where a job\u0026rsquos well done.  Jobsworths can be overcome common sense must win the day."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6952636.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kilmarnock-fc-manager-steve-clarke-calls-sfa-unprofessional-over-a-spelling-gaffe","story":"  The\u0026nbspKilmarnock boss Steve Clarke was mfed after the Scottish FA spelt his name\u0026nbspSteven rather than the correct spelling of Stephen in a disciplinary statement.

Entering the civil service in 1955 he rose through the ranks until his appointment as Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the Scottish Office between 1978 and 1988.

I joined an Anxiety Group which was helpful up to a point but l could only relate to some of what they were saying.\u0026rsquo  This year we offered our first Self-Management Training  course aimed specically at young people aged 18-30 and it was a stonking success. The course was heavily over-subscribed and the learners helped to develop new course materials and ideas specic to their experience.  \u0026lsquoI came home from the first day and shared my expectations with my family.\u0026rsquo  \u0026lsquoBipolar Scotland treated me like an adult when I called them\u0026hellip and gave me hope. That made all the dference.\u0026rsquo    Young Scots with bipolar disorder usually only engage with the NHS during crisis but  we develop early intervention tools and materials directly related to their needs, this will help them to stay well and massively boost their le chances in work, in education and in their personal relationships.

Demand for our support increases every year and we\u0026rsquore really proud of this because it shows that people want what we\u0026rsquove developed.

Together Karen Darke and Ken Talbot have become Scotland\u0027s newest world record holders - in hand-cycling.  Both speed feats were performed while sat inside Arion4 an enclosed hand bicycle pod designed by engineering students from the University of Liverpool in which the riders only see the road on a screen.  Whether it is hand-cycling across the Himalayas, sit skiing across the Greenland ice cap or travelling or climbing the 3,000-foot clf El Capitan in Yosemite, Inverness\u0027s Karen Darke is in her element.    But the 47-year-old\u0027s latest escapade with Mr Talbot set against the golden yellow sand carpet of the semi-arid Nevada desert is far away from the extreme adventures she has devoured - and has amazed some of her closest colleagues.  This time it is about human powered bicycle speed racing and even watching it is not easy.  The instructions for spectators on the desert plateau spell out the dficulties - limited parking and no services and warnings that warm clothing is needed for the cold of the mornings and evenings.  On two consecutive days as the sun came up on Nevada State Route 305 she broke the female hand-cycle land speed record not once, but twice over the flat 2.5 mile course. And in so doing she even managed to surpass an old men\u0026rsquos world which had been standing for seven years. In her velocipede on Wednesday morning she set a speed of 41.86mph - 17mph faster than the previous world record.    Pictures by ULV team  But she was merely warming up, because on Thursday morning she added nearly 5mph to her own mark with a speed of 46.05mph.  Before the arrival on American soil, the arm powered male world record was 45.68 mph and was set in September 2011 by Greg Westlake from Avos Arrow. The female world record was a mere 24.85mph and was set in September 2016 by Sarah Piercy from Plymouth University.  It is, perhaps, apt that Ms Darke who was victorious for Great Britain in hand cycling at the 2016\u0027s Rio Paralympics, should complete the feat near the quiet town of Battle Mountain, dubbed \u0027the town that gold mining saved\u0027.  \"I surprised myself,\" she said Ms Darke, who admitted that she \"freaked out\" when first trying out the enclosed bike she described as \"like an egg\".      \"It is one of the most surreal experiences of my le, because to sit in this pod and crank it up that highway, because I have never done it before, well it feels pretty extreme,\" she said. But it did not end there, as Mr Talbot who with Ms Darke are part of the University of Liverpool Velodipede team broke the men\u0027s record and became the first hand-cyclist to go over 50mph in history with a time of 51.86mph.  Mr Talbot, who got into hand-cycling ten years ago had his training disrupted for a week and a half because of flu but said: \"When I was a little kid, I wanted to be one of the people who went up there and set a record.\"    Both were taking part in the 19th annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge where teams from France, Russia, Japan, Canada, Italy, Mexico, USA, the Netherlands and Britain, bring their high-tech pedal powered bikes to achieve amazing speeds.  The high altitude and arrow straight section of road has attracted athletes worldwide to test their speed bike designs and sprinting abilities since 2000.  The thin air at 4,619ft altitude reduces aerodynamic drag, which coupled with the five mile long acceleration zone enables the bikes to reach their maximum velocity before being timed over a 200 metre distance.  For Ms Darke, this was an interlude in her latest adventure, Quest 79, a project to undertake a total of nine hand-bike rides on seven continents while raising money for charity and encouraging others to take on their own challenges.    \"After Rio I was looking for a new challenge and I heard about this event and I just fancied it,\" she said. \"This was the first time the University of Liverpool had produced a hand-powered bike so I went to visit them and basically said I want to be your female rider. And they said it was okay.  \"I never sat in it until a week before I came our here when I had a few runs on an old runway somewhere near Manchester. So I was on a big learning curve and it was such a surreal experience to be sat in, basically, an egg. It\u0027s very very dferent to riding a regular hand-bike.  \"The first time I tried it on the first day I freaked out. I did go fast but your senses are completely altered. It is so noisy inside and all you can see is the road on a screen. It\u0027s not the actual road.  \"You are just adjusting to everything, the dimensions are dferent, there\u0027s no window, your depth of field is distorted, there are so many things that are new. It has hardly any steering so  there is a gust of wind it blows you off and it is hard to correct it.\"    She was 21 when she fell about 33 feet off a sea clf while rock climbing in Scotland, breaking her skull, arms, neck and back. After three days in a coma, she woke up and was told she was paralysed from the chest down. She\u0027s been in a wheelchair ever since.  Her first expedition after her accident was a hand-bike ride along the Silk Route from Kazakhstan to Pakistan in the Himalayas in 1997 and others followed.  \"Why do I do these things? It\u0027s like trying to say why you are the way you are. I like challenging myself. I like adventures. I like the whole experience that it brings of meeting people and having new experiences and new encounters.  \"Le is to be lived and experienced and that\u0027s what I like to do.\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"schools-withdrawn-from-global-surveys-to-save-cash","story":"  In 2010 Scotland participated in three global educational surveys, but this was reduced to just one after concerns over costs.  Correspondence revealed by the Scottish Labour Party showed the move saved around \u0026pound800,000.  The decision was also taken to reduce the burden on pupils at a time when Curriculum for Excellence was being rolled out.  Another justication was the introduction of the Scottish Schools Literacy and Numeracy Survey, also this too has now been scrapped.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said the documents showed John Swinney, the current Education Secretary, was behind the decision in his former role as Finance Secretary.  Mr Gray said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP removed Scotland from these internationally recognised comparative testing, not for any sound educational reason, but because Mr Swinney didn\u0026rsquot want to pay for them.  \u0026ldquoThe only problem is that the penny pinching Finance Secretary is, of course, now in charge of education. and has just spent \u0026pound4.6 million on national standardised testing, which statisticians say cannot be aggregated.  The 2010 documents quoted Mr Swinney stating that the OECD\u0026rsquos international PISA survey was a \u0026ldquochunky piece of external research.  As Education Secretary he has used the study as a justication for introducing controversial standardised assessments.  However, a spokesman for Mr Swinney accused Scottish Labour of \u0026ldquorank hypocrisy of the worst kind.  He said: \u0026ldquoLabour are actively campaigning to cut assessments from Scotland\u0026rsquos school in the teeth of international best practice and experience while simultaneously complaining that Scotland left two international studies years ago.  \u0026ldquoThis reveals a simple truth: they are not concerned about assessments, they simply want to play politics with our schools.  \u0026ldquoFar from standing on principle, they flip flop at every turn, posing one minute as supporters of assessment and the next as opponents.  He said Mr Swinney was committed to OECD\u0026rsquos PISA survey which he described as an effective indicator of how the whole Scottish education system was performing."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-members-criticise-campaign-fronted-by-partys-public-finance-minister","story":"  A motion to be tabled at next month\u0026rsquos SNP conference raises concerns over the impact of banning single-use plastic straws.  Kate Forbes, who was promoted in Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos recent reshuffle, has pushed for the UK and Scottish governments to outlaw plastic straws in a bid to boost the environment.  But the SNP\u0026rsquos Aberdeen Central branch appeared to take aim at her \u0026ldquoFinal Straw campaign.  Its motion said it \u0026ldquowelcomes initiatives to reduce and remove the unnecessary usage of any single-use plastics.  However it notes a \u0026ldquocomplete ban on single-use plastic straws would directly harm disabled people and jeopardies their independence.  It adds: \u0026ldquoConference proposes that guidelines be established for any environmental legislation or policy, ensuring that disabled people are not unfairly disadvantaged by well-meaning but harmful campaigns, and further proposes constructing policy which focuses on finding innovative solutions to plastic waste which target the real dangers instead of stigmatising or excluding disabled people.  Ms Forbes wrote to the Scottish Government earlier this year requesting \u0026ldquoalternatives to plastic straws are recommended before any ban is brought into force.  It came after a disability group called on her to pause the Final Straw campaign while concerns are addressed.  In her letter, she insisted: \"It is important that the needs of disabled people are fully considered as we look to protect our environment for future generations.\"  The Skye, Lochaber \u0026amp Badenoch MSP is widely seen as one of the SNP\u0027s rising stars."},{"url":null,"title":"john-swinney-branded-odd-over-school-testing-demonstration","story":"  The Education Secretary wrote to every MSP in Holyrood in a bid to defend standardised assessments for primary one pupils.  He asked\u0026nbspthem to attend a \u0026ldquodrop-in demonstration of the Scottish National Standardised Assessments on Tuesday, adding: \"The demonstration will be conducted by Scottish Government officials.\"  He wrote: \u0026ldquoThe demonstration will offer the opportunity to view an example of the P1 assessment, as well as the chance to see the information it generates for teachers.  \u0026ldquoIn order to ensure parliament\u0026rsquos consideration of this issue is as informed as possible, I do hope you will be able to attend.  It comes as opposition leaders are expected to join forces next week to vote for the tests to be scrapped.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos education spokesman Iain Gray branded Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos latest move \u0026ldquodesperate.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe idea that civil servants performing the tests to MSPs is in any way equivalent to the pressure felt by a four-year-old sitting them is utter nonsense.  \u0026ldquoIf John Swinney truly wants an informed debate he should listen to the calls from teachers and educationalists who say the tests are useless, or the parents of traumatised children who do not trust them.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the offer was \u0026ldquoodd.  He said: \"I am much more interested in what teachers and parents have to say about these tests than I am in watching John Swinney\u0027s civil servants push buttons on a screen.  \"Teachers, campaigners and EIS Scotland have lambasted these tests as a waste of effort yet the Education Secretary is point blank refusing to listen.  \"The clock is now ticking down until Parliament votes to scrap them. The only question left to answer is whether John Swinney will then do the right thing and change course.\"  Next week\u0026rsquos vote is expected to be brought forward by the Scottish Tories.  While a Holyrood defeat would not be binding for the SNP Government, it would be politically dficult to ignore.  The literacy and numeracy tests have sparked a huge backlash from parents, teachers and unions since they were brought in last year.  Children are assessed in P1, P4, P7 and S3 to help teachers judge their progress, but there have been claims some five-year-olds have been reduced to tears.  Mr Swinney previously announced a shake-up of the assessments, insisting they are \u0026ldquoabsolutely not a test and should not feel like one."},{"url":null,"title":"birthday celebration for charity knitter iris","story":"        A Rothienorman woman who knits items for charity is preparing to celebrate her 98th birthday.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most erse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural signicance and interest.

He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were ing.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my le so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney  had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his le and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a le as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my le had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some dficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new le.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the dference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gt that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a le free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gt – enjoying le to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive dference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new le basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gt.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my le and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gt.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"temporary closure for post office","story":"        Kemnay Post Office will close temporarily from the start of next month.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 7:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classication of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in

Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks. He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartSaturday 15 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage. It has been a delight to watch Hope develop into a self-assured and confident young lady who is always keen to represent the views and opinions of young people from Orkney and beyond!”Jack Norquoy said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m absolutely delighted to be part of the panel to represent the work of SYP, young folk in Orkney, and crucially help to ensure we see a progression, not a regression of young people\u0026#8217s rights in Brexit.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

Since then, the band has played at ious local venues supporting charities and community projects.On September 21, the BYOB charity dance from 7pm until 11pm will benefit the nearby Groam House Museum, an outstanding centre for Pictish and Celtic art.Tickets, which cost \u0026pound10 for adults and \u0026pound5 for children aged 16 and under \u0026ndash or \u0026pound25 for a family of four \u0026ndash may be bought in advance from Groam House Museum and Rosemarkie Spar shop or on the door on the night.The event is one of a series being organised by the volunteers of Groam House to raise funds for ongoing repairs and renewals following the rapid decline in Highland Council support.The unique display is focused on 15 carved Pictish stones which all originated in Rosemarkie, an important centre for early Christianity. The pride of the permanent display is the magnicent Rosemarkie cross slab, decorated with Pictish symbols and Christian crosses.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

The Milnfua Rt Raft crew took third place. The Mermaids may have been pipped at the post but made a splash all the same as fancy dress winners.The RNLI all-weather Trent Class leboat then vividly displayed the challenges crews face when undertaking a rescue with a vessel aground during exciting demonstrations.A craft village organised by Gloria Mackenzie was a treat for landlubbers with everything from pebble art to quilts and engraving on display.A pet show also proved a pull with a iety of prizes handed out. Best in Show was awarded to \"Rosie\" Ross, a chiapso pup.Children\u0026rsquos activities ranging from balloon modelling to face painting and funfair crowds kept younger visitors entertained.The emergency services also lent their support with ambulance and fire personnel showing people around their vehicles and equipment.Leboat spokesman Michael MacDonald said: \"The leboat open day this year was excellent, with everyone having fun.

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Cairngorms Business Partnership chief executive Mark Tate said the global exposure provided by such big-budget movies is a huge boost for the local economy.\nThe film itself tells the untold, true story of 14th Century Robert the Bruce who transforms from defeated nobleman to outlaw hero during the oppressive occupation of medieval Scotland by Edward I of England.\nDespite grave consequences, Robert seizes the Scottish crown and rallies an impassioned group of men to fight back against the mighty army of the king and his volatile son, the prince of Wales.\nAlso starring are Scottish actors James Cosmo, Tony Curran, Steven Cree, Chris Fulton and Alistair Mackenzie.\nAnother big-budget movie, Mary Queen of Scots, was also being shot in the strath at the same time.\nThe film, starring Saoirse Ronan, Margot Robbie and David Tennant, is scheduled to be released at the end of this year.\nSaturday 15 Sep 2018 7:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117299.jpg","title":"Conservation hub set for expansion","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHERE was a disappointing response to a recent six-week public consultation to gauge local thinking about a proposed extension of Grantown\u0027s conservation area.\nLess than one per cent of residents offered an opinion. Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nSaturday 15 Sep 2018 7:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment ing from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza .

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and ied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

biscuits to take on paris buns","story":"\nGraham\u0026#8217s Bakery is set to tempt the people of Paris away from their buns having won its first business in France with an order to  supply a leading retail chain with its award-winning biscuits.\n\n                \nThe family-owned bakery, which is based in Dromore, has just sent the first consignment of its Irish Oat Cookies and Irish Butter Shortbread to Comptoir Irlandais, headquartered at Plouedem in Brittainy with 45 stores across France including Paris.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTim Graham, sales and marketing director of Graham’s, commenting on the company’s latest export deal, says: “The order followed an approach to us by a member of Comptoir’s management team at a major food show in London. “He sampled our products and was impressed by their taste and quality and also by our history.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“We subsequently sent samples to the company in France and an initial order for our Irish Oat Cookies and Irish Butter Shortbread, two of our most successful products for export, followed. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“Comptoir gives us a strong base for growth in France because of its profile as a business specialising in premium food and drink from the United Kingdom and Ireland. \n\n“As well as food and drink, the stores sell a broad range of quality goods from the British Isles. \n\n“The success of the Comptoir business model is seen in its growth to 45 stores across France in the past 30 years. \n\n“This is potentially very important business for us because of the retailer’s impressive reputation and its presence in most of the nation’s main cities.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe new business in France follows the bakery’s exports of its biscuits and other products, such as mini cakes and muffins, to the US, the Middle East and Republic of Ireland.  \n\nThe bakery also supplies retailers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nExporting has become an integral part of the enterprising Northern Ireland company’s business.\n\nThe bakery, a UK Great Taste award winner, is a third generation family business that started producing a range of freshly baked breads, cakes and buns in 1956 in premises at the heart of Dromore.  It operates from a state-of-the-art bakery in the town and uses local butter in its award- winning Irish biscuits, sponge cakes and swiss rolls.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe company now employs 50 people and has a portfolio of 20 dferent products all baked on site.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan. Co Armagh.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMore formal details of funeral arrangements stated Cameron Alan Thomas Truesdale died peacefully at home on September 5 ‘in the arms of his Mum and Dad after the bravest battle with cancer’. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCameron was the ‘precious and loving son of Hammy and Cassie, biggest and best brother of Chloe, Courtney and Caitlin, beloved step son of David and Cheryl and a much loved grandson, great grandson, cousin, nephew and friend’. \n\nA service of thanksgiving will be held in Donaghcloney Elim Church on Sunday at 2:30pm followed by interment in Lurgan Cemetery. \n\nHouse strictly private. \n\nNo flowers please, donations  desired payable to Cancer Fund for Children  Curlew Pavillion, Portmore Business Park,

Northern Ireland and, indeed, across the world as a fundraising campaign was launched to help fund his treatment as part of a clinical trial in Mexico. \n\nFor a time it appeared the treatment was bearing fruit, unfortunately over the following months his condition worsened until just a few weeks ago the family warned ‘his journey was near over’. \n\nHis battle began in January 2017 when the youngster was diagnosed with an inoperable Dfuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma also known as ‘DIPG’ which is the second most common type of primary, high grade brain tumour in children. \n\nWhile the outlook was grim his family refused to give up and they discovered a pioneering treatment in Mexico. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn September last year they travelled from their home in Waringstown near Lurgan to Mexico in a bid to save his le. \n\nThe Cure4Cam fundraising page was set up with in excess of £100,000 raised to pay for his treatment thanks to incredible support coming from Northern Ireland and beyond.\n\nRead more by \nclicking here\n.\n\n                            \n            \n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountul fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautul, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these dferent organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the dference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37317401.ece/58baa/AUTOCROP/w65square/s_Eye_-_Belfa%20274.jpg","title":"belfast giants vs dundee stars photos","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed  the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105  the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause signicant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and dfered substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes,  a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the interim,  it is similar to previous industrial revolutions, it seems likely there will be a period of technological unemployment, dislocation and rising inequality.\n\n“Given that it could happen more rapidly, the challenge of workforce adjustment could be more dficult.\n\n“The shts required in employment from jobs involving heads to those with hearts and hands could be far greater each year than seen in previous episodes.”\n\nHe noted that rates of pay growth in the UK were below pre-financial crisis averages of a decade ago, largely reflecting continued weakness in productivity growth, and said uncertainty around Brexit has had a dampening effect.\n\nHe reiterated that the Bank of England was well prepared for a range of potential Brexit outcomes.\n\n“The Monetary Policy Committee will respond to any persistent change in the outlook to bring inflation sustainably back to 2% target while doing what it can to support jobs and activity.\n\n“The appropriate policy response is not automatic and will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dragons den star joins race to be ireland president","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

became the fourth official candidate for October’s poll after he secured the backing from Waterford County Council.\n\nAt the special council meeting he secured 14 votes over journalist and would-be candidate Gemma O’Doherty’s two votes and one abstention from Sinn Fein.\n\nThe former Dragons’ Den star was previously endorsed by councils in Meath, Carlow and Wicklow.\n\n\n\nI’m looking forward to

the fourth nomination and to now be a candidate to contest the presidential election of 2018,” he said.\n\nMr Duffy said he was heartened to receive support from across the council chamber in Waterford, including the backing of Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Labour members.\n\n“It’s great to be attracting that cross-party support which I have done throughout a number of councils,” he told RTE.\n\n“I’m looking forward to really going out and being able to state my case to the people and go forth and being elected president of Ireland.”\n\nMr Duffy started his career as a shareholder in radio stations, and in 1992 he co-founded a media and management consultancy.\n\nHe has been a panellist on the Irish version of Dragons’ Den for all eight seasons since the show began in 2009.\n\nMr Duffy has worked in the past as an adviser to both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.\n\nMr Duffy has said he would accept the full presidential salary of 350,000 euro.\n\nThe current President, Michael D Higgins, has voluntarily reduced his own salary to under 250,000 euro while in office.\n\nMr Duffy will join another former Dragons’ Den star Sean Gallagher and Senator Joan Freeman who reached the quota on Monday, an unnamed Sinn Fein candidate, and current President Michael D Higgins.\n\nThe election takes place on October 26.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"whos in the race for the irish

His venture capital portfolio has been concentrated on recruitment, professional development, education and media.\n\nHe has been a panellist on the Irish version of Dragon’s Den for all eight seasons since the show began in 2009.\n\nMr Duffy has worked in the past as an adviser to both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.\n\nHe has said he would accept the full presidential salary of 350,000 euro.\n\nThe current President, Michael D Higgins, has voluntarily reduced his own salary to under 250,000 euro while in office.\n\nMr Duffy will run as an independent candidate after securing his nomination by winning the backing of Waterford, Meath, Carlow and Wicklow councils.\n\nSenator Joan Freeman\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJoan Freeman is the only woman in the race \n\n\n\n\nThe sole woman in the contest so far is a psychologist and mental health activist from Dublin.\n\nSenator Joan Freeman, 60, has also served on the Seanad since May 2016 after being nominated by the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny. She is the chairperson on the committee on mental health.\n\nSenator Freeman founded Pieta House, a suicide intervention charity, in 2006 in Lucan, County Dublin. It now boasts 12 additional centres around Ireland.\n\nSenator Freeman also founded the annual fundraising event Darkness into Light in aid of Pieta House. The event began with 400 participants in 2008 and has since grown with approximately 200,000 people participating in the 2018 events held across Ireland, including at the Phoenix Park.\n\nShe resigned from Pieta House in 2014, in order to concentrate on developing Solace House, a similar charity based in New York City launched in 2015.\n\nSenator Freeman will run as an independent candidate. She earned the backing of Galway City Council as well as Galway County, Fingal and Cork County councils.\n\nThe Irish Presidential election will be held on October 26.\n\nSinn Fein is set to announce its candidate on Sunday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new centrist party may be impossible says tony blair","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

table when families go to bed.\n\nMr Bauckham advised parents to lead by example, and get involved with their children’s use of technology, and said they should “allow a period where phones and computers can be used, but strictly demarcate that in the family routine”.\n\nThe former headteacher warned that increased use of social media was making teenagers more isolated.\n\n“Psychologically, mentally, emotionally, I think they are probably more fragile than they have been for generations,” he said.\n\n“That’s because of unregulated exposure to the internet: porn, social media, all the risky aspects.”\n\nMr Bauckham also said schools should engage with parents to promote more responsible use of technology.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":"\n Hi

The media captured the events of the day relaying it to a mass audience via TV and radio, and subsequently it became known as the day the Troubles began.\n\nThe event is being held as part of the Speeches Strikes and Struggles series which has been running throughout the year, led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and supported by the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund. The programme aims to open archive materials up to new audiences and offer a iety of perspectives on what was an immensely signicant era.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said it would provide a unique opportunity to hear first-hand accounts from some of the people who led the civil rights campaign. \n\n“The Duke Street March changed the course of local history by initiating a movement against the civil oppression which had affected the lives of so many people across N. Ireland. People took to the streets to demonstrate that they were not prepared to accept the ongoing violation of their civil rights which had become the accepted way of le here.\n\n“50 years on we live in a very dferent society thanks to the actions of those who were prepared to stand up against oppression. This is a great chance to hear from some of the veteran leaders of that movement and their first-hand accounts of what actually happened on that day.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nOn the day young people will have the opportunity to put their questions to a special panel made up of Civil Rights veteran Eamonn McCann, Aidan McKinney and Anne Devlin.

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily. It will be open at weekends.\n\nLocal councillor Dermot Curran has expressed concern that motorists and visitors to the area face more disruption and believes the resurfacing work should have been completed during the recent road closures.\n\nHe plans to contact the Department for Infrastructure to ensure the resurfacing work can be completed as soon as possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main road linking Downpatrick and Ardglass carries a high volume of traffic, with a lot of this associated with the village\u0026rsquos fishing industry. These road closures are disruptive and I am disappointed the drainage upgrade and resurfacing work was not completed at the same time, continued Cllr Curran.\n\n\u0026ldquoI am fully supportive of the much-needed investment along this particular route, but feel the timing of the work to minimise road closures and disruption could have been handled better.\n\nAlso this week, Cllr Curran has revealed a similar situation has arisen on the Strangford side of Ardglass where a road was closed recently as part of planned improvements.\n\nA section of the road linking the village with Chapeltown was closed in mid-July to upgrade drainage systems and is now closed again. Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment. I just sometimes think that the execution of the schemes could be better to minimise disruption.\n\n\u0026ldquoFor example, the closure of the Chapeltown Road which links Ardglass with Strangford will be in operation when children  to school for the new term.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Championships getting serious  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO remain on target for a magical seven-in-a-row as the race for the Down Senior Football Championship crown starts to intensy.\n\nPaul McIver\u0026rsquos record-breakers saw off Downpatrjck on a score of 2-14 to 0-10 in Newcastle on Saturday evening and now await the draw to see who they will meet in the semi-finals.\n\nThe draw was to have been made on Monday night following the clash between Loughinisland and Warrenpoint, but as that finished level at 0-9 apiece, the draw will now take place in St Malachy\u0026rsquos Park, Castlewellan, after Saturday\u0026rsquos replay.\n\nDownpatrick were expected to push Kilcoo all the way in their quarter-final, but the threat never materialised.\n\nKilcoo had just too know how for Downpatrick and second half goals from Ceilum Doherty and a ing Ryan Johnston put the issue out of the RGU\u0026rsquos reach.\n\nJoining Kilcoo in the semi-finals are Mayobridge and Burren with the fourth place waiting on the outcome of the Loughinisland v Warrenpoint replay.\n\nMayobridge were taken to the wire by Clonduff in their quarter-final tie and only emerged 2-16 to 2-15 winners after a mighty Clonduff fightback just fell short.\n\nBurren had their hands full against Castlewellan on Sunday night, but they were able to spring Donal O\u0026rsquoHare from the bench and his contribution of three points at a crucial stage of the game proved decisive \u0026mdash Burren scraping home 0-10 to 0-7.\n\nCoincidentally, despite the fact that the current system used for the SFC and IFC has been heavily criticised, the top four teams in Division 1 of the ACFL \u0026mdash should Warrenpoint go through \u0026mdash are all in the last four.\n\nIt is a similar case in the IFC with Bredagh, Liatroim and Darragh Cross \u0026mdash who were all expected to reach this stage of the competition \u0026mdash joining Division 3 leaders Saul in the semi-finals.\n\nThe IFC draw was made in Monday night and pits Darragh Cross against East Down rivals Liatroim with Saul clashing with Bredagh in another all East Down derby.\n\nDarragh were extremely impressive in their 2-8 to 0-6 demolition of Drumgath in Kilcoo on Monday night, while Liatroim enjoyed a 2-17 to 0-12 win over Tullylish. Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

Both rings are decorated.\n\nThe broken ring\u0026rsquos surface is ided into a number of panels, some with a cross-style mot. The decoration, though not as accomplished as on other examples, does compare with similar patterns which experts suggest characterise a series of silver rings of 12th-century date from both Ireland and Britain.\n\nThe intact rings decoration includes a flower pattern and traces of lettering which may read a version of \u0026lsquoIESU REX EXAUDI NOS\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoJesus, king, hear us\u0026rsquo, but this is not certain.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe nature of the lettering, which is termed Lombardic, suggests the 13th or 14th century while the style of the ring overall is consistent with this date. As the two rings from Bright dfer little from each other in date, it is assumed they were lost or deposited together at the same time.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are of interest in illustrating the range of finger rings being worn in east Ulster in the late middle ages and might have been made locally or imported.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe ruins of Bright Castle, believed to have been built between the 15th and 16th century, are close by and may have been built on an earlier settlement. If the rings were in circulation for a reasonable  of time it is even possible that they could have been owned and eventually lost by the castle\u0026rsquos occupants.\n\nMeanwhile, a fragment of Viking \u0026lsquohack silver\u0026rsquo, dating back to the ninth or 10th century, has been discovered near Drumbo.\n\nExperts say the piece, which is less than 2cm in , would originally have been part of a larger item such as an arm ring or bracelet.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Scientist elected as international council member  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA CARRYDUFF scientist has been awarded membership of a prestigious international body for food science and technology.\n\nProfessor Margaret Patterson has been elected as one of the seven council members of the International Union of Food Science and Technology .\n\nIUFoST represents more than 150,000 food scientists and technologists in over 60 countries throughout the world.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

proximity to him installed a total of 11 RHI boilers, yet he has said that he never advised them to do so nor did he see the lucrative  figures given to them by the installers for how much money they could make.\n\n                \nDr Andrew Crawford, who ed to the RHI Inquiry yesterday for a fth day of evidence,  faced repeated questioning from inquiry counsel Joseph Aiken and from the inquiry panel over that claim.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nAndrew Crawford giving evidence to the RHI Inquiry\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe inquiry was told that the former DUP special adviser’s brother, James Crawford, received a quotation on June 6, 2014, from CHP Mechanical for the installation of biomass boilers on his poultry farm.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe quotation made clear that his RHI income would be dependent on the level of heat produced by his boiler and then set out that the capital cost of the boilers would be paid off by the end of year three – with RHI payments to continue for a further 17 years.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn example calculation showed that a boiler owner could expect to get an annual RHI payment of £12,930 per year, with additional fuel savings of £16,437 – meaning RHI income of about a quarter of a million pounds over the 20-year scheme.\n\nMr Aiken put it to Dr Crawford that anyone receiving such a document may be unsure as to whether the claims in it could be accurate and asked him: “How likely is it that [he] – [to] his brother and the special adviser to the minister who brought the scheme that he’s thinking of participating in – didn’t put this document in front of your nose to say ‘Andrew, surely that can’t be right?’”\n\nDr Crawford said: “Well, I’m very clear that he didn’t put it in front of my nose. \n\n“I had no discussion with him about this document, I’d no recollection of ever seeing this document ever before I’ve already said that when I was special adviser I was based in Belfast, I lived in Belfast. Yes, I went home at the weekends and I would have been in regular contact with my family – I’m not distancing myself from that – but I do not have any recollection of seeing this document or having any discussion around it.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPressed by inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin, Dr Crawford said: “I didn’t see the document”, before immediately correcting himself to say: “I’ve no recollection of seeing the document”.\n\nThree months later, Dr Crawford received a ministerial submission about the expansion of the RHI scheme to domestic properties. On the cover of the submission, Dr Crawford wrote the words “what about the non-domestic scheme?”\n\nAt that time he also planted a question to his own minister by getting DUP MLA William Irwin to table a written Assembly question asking  there were any plans to make the RHI less lucrative.\n\nAndrew McCormick, who at that point was the most senior civil servant in Mrs Foster and Dr Crawford’s Stormont department, told the inquiry that when looking back on events it now appeared to him that “well before the problems with the scheme began to emerge , Andrew Crawford appeared to be interested specically in the tarf. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While the origin of the flaw with the tarf still appears to have been a genuine mistake, it is possible that, like many in the private sector, he became aware of the issue relatively quickly.”\n\nHe said that Dr Crawford’s “early interest” in the level of subsidy was evident on a number of occasions, including his planted question to Mrs Foster.\n\nDr Crawford initially told the inquiry that he had asked the question because he wanted to “publicise the fact that there was [sic] not going to be any cost controls introduced to the non-domestic scheme at this stage”.\n\nBut Dr McCormick said: “I have not seen any evidence that suggests that officials were recommending or concerned about costs controls at that stage, so it is not obvious to me why Andrew Crawford felt a need for the point to be publicised”.\n\nDr Crawford also sent an email to huge poultry processor Moy Park in November 2014 saying that the “changes [likely to apply from summer 2015] are not likely to have a negative impact on Moy Park growers”, something Dr McCormick said was striking because he did not believe there was any hint of retrospective changes to the scheme which would have meant Moy Park required such reassurance.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen asked yesterday  there was any reason why people should be suspicious of what he was doing in that period and that he may have known by late 2014 that the scheme was far too generous, Dr Crawford said: “At this stage, I remain [sic] that I wasn’t clear about the tarf rate – the attractiveness, as you describe it, of the tarf. I can’t say more than that.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Why would any reasonable bystander seeing that not be curious – not suspicious that’s the word that’s been used – but curious as to why you were doing that?”\n\nDr Crawford said: “Well, obviously it was raised I’m not sure who by in terms of...”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Don’t worry who raised it. Why would anybody not be curious about why you were doing these two things – you’re organising the question, and you are contacting Moy Park?”\n\nDr Crawford said that people were “piecing together pieces of information from over a period of time... there has been a large number of pieces of literature put in front of me in terms of submissions and all the rest of it what’s happening here is that he’s pulling out two particular comments or an Assembly Question and pulling them together.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “That’s right. They are taking two particular elements. So I’ve asked you why anybody wouldn’t be particularly curious about it. Now I want to ask you why did you arrange the Assembly Question.”\n\nDr Crawford went on to say that he could not now say what prompted the question but that it may have been a newspaper article. He said that the Moy Park message came as the result of a request from the company.\n\nUltimately, Dr Crawford’s brother got a quote from another company – which he accepted, installing two boilers – which showed that between fuel payments and RHI payments he would be getting about £32,000 per year for 30 years.\n\nDr Crawford again said that he was never shown that document.\n\nDr Crawford’s
