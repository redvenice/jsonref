For a boxer who has not fought in 23 months, it’s obvious Khan’s appeal stretches far beyond the ring.His popularity is swelled by a electric and combative nature, and the ongoing interest around his personal life. It’s an inevitable outcome of wanting to remain relevant and an extension of becoming famous. Stop making news in your work? Well your private life will do the business.Amir Khan slams Canelo Alvarez\u0027s drugs ban: \u0027People will always remember him as a cheat!\u0027Khan steps into the ring against Canadian Phil Lo Greco in Liverpool this weekend. The outing will end a near two-year exile from fighting. It’s not harsh to say Khan likes the limelight. He performs well there, and for the most part of his boxing career, Khan has thrived under the weight of expectation.But it cannot be underestimated how difficult it is to make the switch from celebrity to fighter, even if Khan did once occupy both spaces simultaneously. One man who found out the hard way about this tricky transition was David Haye.The heavyweight returned to boxing after three years of really enjoying retirement. He had two glitzy fights and then came unstuck against the seasoned Tony Bellew.Not only was Haye’s focus, training and strategy warped, but his body cracked under the pressure of a return to fighting. He wore the wrong kind of boots, his fitness was not up to scratch and his Achilles snapped. Granted, Haye was 36 when he fought Bellew, Khan is only 31, but he should treat what happened to his fellow Brit as a warning.His focus slipped and his body gave up on him (Picture: Getty)Bellew felt he could exploit Haye’s inactivity and he did just that. Lo Greco believes he can do the same against Khan.Khan doesn’t drink, but he’s no stranger to partying. By his own admission he has trained only intermittedly since his last fight. Lo Greco puts great stock in that fact and believes Khan has proven himself to be ‘mentally weak’ after two troubled years away from boxing.‘It all started for jokes and giggles, but he bit,’ Greco said. ‘He definitely doesn’t have thick skin, and now we’re here.Khan was subdued at the final press conference (Picture: Mercury Press)‘What happened was, I have a TV show called the ‘Culinary Fighter’. I tagged him in one of my episodes because I called him a ‘Khandashian’‘I tagged him and he blocked me. I didn’t think much of it. I’m like whatever, he took it personally, and then when he announced the fight, I called my producer and said hey man, do me a favour, knock up some photos, let’s just have some fun. But I didn’t think he was going to bite.As any world champion will tell you, performing consistently at an elite level requires an unbreakable mentality and focus. Khan was competing in I’m A Celebrity as recently as December. The stint in the jungle can be seen as a wonderful PR move to remind the paying public of Khan’s personality, but can also be viewed as another distraction.Khan believes the time off has helped his body heal and re-group from a life of boxing. It’s a good argument, but his body could have also slowed down, softened, without the stresses of training camps and fights. Problems with his right hand prolonged Khan’s absence, as he took more time than expected to recover from the surgery.Khan’s last fight was a knockout loss to Canelo Alvarez (Picture: Getty)For a fighter who relies so heavily on his speed and reflexes, it seems a massive risk to take for a reward that may not materialise.There’s also the question of whether the chilling knockout at the hands of Canelo Alvarez will linger on Khan’s body and mind. Khan was always open to be hit and Alvarez wasn’t the first man to put him straight to sleep. But it will also not be the first time Khan has had to come back from a painful stoppage.Khan’s doubters will question his mental state and his chin, but the fighter has rejected the idea he is returning for anything other than for himself.‘I’ve done a lot in the game, I’ve made a lot of money, I’ve made a big name for myself, I’ve fought in America,’ Khan said.‘I just want to achieve a ­little bit more in the game. If I win another world title I can say: ‘Thank you very much, I’ve had a great time, a great career.’I’m 31, look at Manny Pacquiao, who is 39 and started having his big fights at 31. Look at Floyd Mayweather, he is 41 years old and still fighting. I’m still a baby.Mentally, it’s been a turbulent two years out of the ring. Khan fell out with his parents, then reconciled. There was significant strain on his marriage, and it all played out in the press and on Khan’s social media.Physically, Khan has taken time to recover, and will have to face the consequences of that risk.There have been changes in Khan’s team. He was forced to take on a new trainer after his long-term coach Virgil Hunter fell ill in March. The Experienced Joe Goossen has stepped in to guide Khan, but there’s no telling how that late set-back could affect his confidence.(Picture: AFP)Matchroom boss Eddie Hearn now holds the promotional strings. Khan will be hoping the British promoting powerhouse will be able to get him the biggest fights and the opponents he wants.But the biggest test for Khan is himself. Lo Greco is a fighter he should dispatch with ease. But Khan needs to prove he’s rediscovered his focus and it may take time to produce his best form.The journey back to a world title may be longer and tougher than Khan thinks. It all starts with the Bolton-native successfully switching his mindset.

I went through to the girls’ room to waken them up and get Dior ready for school. When I opened the door all I could see of my little girl was her legs sticking out from under the teddy.‘She was lying face facing up in the bed but with the big teddy on top of her.

I recognised him from the television\u0027. Former neighbours of Winton in Central London have paid their tributes to the TV star.\u0027I saw him a few weeks ago,\u0027 said a woman who lives on York Terrace East and declined to be identified.\u0027He was delightful, always very kind, but he hadn\u0027t been the same since Cilla (Black) died. Since then, he spent a lot more time in Florida.\u0027A man who lives opposite Winton\u0027s former residence said: \u0027He was a very nice man. Very agreeable and cheerful. He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew. Always in my heart.\u0027 It was signed \u0027Go Go\u0027. Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious.

I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn\u0027t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, \u0027I want to withdraw\u0027.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked \u0027what took you so long?\u0027 \u0026amp he said \u0027sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!\u0027In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner. He gave them a huge wave \u0026amp called out \u0027hello loves, hello darlings!\u0027 I asked why he was saying hello. He replied \u0027always wave at policemen David.

Although Copperfield (left in court yesterday) said it might be his fault if an audience volunteer who was participating in an illusion got hurt, the celebrated magician didn\u0027t acknowledge responsibility for injuries Gavin Cox (right) claims to have suffered when he fell          Gavin Cox  is claiming lasting brain and body injuries and more than $400,000 in medical expenses. He claims to have suffered injuries to his brain, neck and shoulders      The illusionist (pictured in court on Wednesday) said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris  The 61-year-old performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court Copperfield said he didn\u0027t know whether there as a powdery residue near a trash bin in an MGM Grand alley. He said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris.\u0027If in fact there was construction dust, could that be your fault if someone fell and got hurt?\u0027 Morelli asked.Copperfield responded that he couldn\u0027t answer a hypothetical question before proceedings ended for the day.Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid giving away performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of the illusionist\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors. The performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court.           MGM Grand\u0027s attorney Jerry Popovich told the jury that Cox simply missed a step when he fell and did not slip. He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree dropCox, from Kent, claims lasting brain and body injuries and more than $400,000 in medical expenses. He claims to have suffered injuries to his brain, neck and shoulders.He and his wife, Minh-Hahn Cox, are seeking unspecified damages in their lawsuit, which also names as defendants the MGM Grand, show producer Backstage Employment and Referral, and construction firm Team Construction Management.Cox, who was at the show as the highlight of a dream trip to celebrate his 53rd birthday, claims negligence led to his fall.On Tuesday, the magician\u0027s friend and executive producer, Chris Kenner declined to say it was dangerous to lead people along a dark and unknown route over changing floor surfaces of linoleum, cement, carpet, sidewalk and tile. The illusion had been performed thousands of times over the last two decades, with about 55,000 taking part in the last ten years alone and none of them having had a problem, Kenner said.Earlier in the case, MGM Grand\u0027s attorney Jerry Popovich told the jury that Cox simply missed a step when he fell and did not slip. He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree drop. Popovich said that 10 minutes before Cox went down, Copperfield had walked through that same area as part of another illusion that did not involve audience participation. He said Copperfield would have notified staff if he had noticed any problem in the route.    Gavin Cox (pictured) was overcome with emotion as opening statements were made in the case. He claims that on returning to Britain after taking part in the trick, he suffered chronic pain while a scan showed a lesion on his brain.He said Copperfield\u0027s assistants hurried him down a secret passage, through a door and outside into the open air. He said: \u0027It was like a fire alarm went off. They were saying Hurry! Run, run, run!\u0027It was total pandemonium. You don’t know where you are going. It’s dark. There are hands pushing you on your back. As I went around a corner, my feet slipped from underneath me and I hit the ground.\u0027Mr Cox says he fell as he ran around the side of the theater.In the interview, he said that he as now forced to wear an oxygen \u0027lung\u0027 at night because he stops breathing, and he spent three months in a Californian brain trauma centre. The couple claimed they had been forced to live in the US for years as the case dragged on.Mrs Cox said in 2016: \u0027We are too broke to go out and Gavin’s injuries prevent us from enjoying a normal life. Gavin once cooked for royalty but now he can’t even bake a muffin because he has nerve damage in his hands and no sense of smell.\u0027 Mr Cox said he blacked out after his fall but remembers the audience cheering at the end of the trick. An ambulance later took Mr Cox to hospital where his right shoulder was found to be dislocated.Two days later he filled out an accident report at MGM and hired a US personal injury lawyer.  Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid disclosing performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of Copperfield\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors Once back in Britain, Mr Cox said he began to suffer chronic pain, headaches and confusion. A scan would later show lesions on his brain. But Mrs Cox said NHS waiting lists were ‘too long and he needed immediate treatment’.So the couple returned to Vegas in February 2014. Their travel insurer refused to pay for ongoing treatment, but they were seen under a \u0027medical lien\u0027 – doctors agreed to treat Mr Cox and receive payment only when the lawsuit is settled.Mr Cox\u0027s career had once included years as a chef at London’s Buck’s Club, where he cooked for the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and Dracula actor Christopher Lee, and running a guesthouse in Broadstairs, Kent. But he said in the interview that he has been unable to work since the accident.Having had multiple operations on his back and neck, he said he had been diagnosed with permanent brain damage and a form of Parkinson’s. The Coxes were forced to sell their guesthouse for £515,000 at the end of 2014 and had been living off their savings. At the time of the interview, the Mail On Sunday quoted Copperfield’s lawyers as saying they denied all allegations but could not comment further due to ongoing litigation.They added: ‘This illusion has been performed for more than 15 years and with more than 100,000 participants.

Should her wish be granted?This group of nations - from Canada to Cameroon, Australia to Antigua - is made up of countries and small islands which Britain inherited, conquered and used to advantage as we built an Empire.We used their people as slaves and cheap labour. We plundered their resources, dumped our convicts on their shores and took hundreds of years to belatedly allow them to claim independence.There’s a strong argument that- in the 21st century - the Commonwealth represents a paternalistic, outdated view of the world.The Queen tells world leaders that it is her \u0027sincere wish\u0027...Theresa May promises to introduce a ban on the sale of...Share this articleNevertheless, ever since the Queen took over as Head following the death of her father George VI, she has enchanted and beguiled the most republican of member states.Elizabeth made the Commonwealth her special project, travelling thousands of miles to visit the 53 territories and realms, and has shown huge compassion and understanding of the issues facing its disparate members.          Her majesty and the heir to the throne (pictured together) are followed out of the ballroom by the Duchess of Wales following today\u0027s Commonwealth summitNow, at 92 on Saturday, she’s anxious to step down, and gave up long-haul travel in 2013.Unlike most of the Commonwealth leaders, Elizabeth was born into immense privilege - she inherited wealth and far-flung places that have few ties to the United Kingdom.There are plenty of reasons why the Commonwealth should not work as a loose grouping of states - but amazingly, it continues to survive, providing a useful forum which draws countries together, rather than apart.Given that the British throne rules a diminishing number of Commonwealth nations - why should the next leader come from the House of Windsor?Would it not be fairer to let the Commonwealth Heads of Government hold a secret ballot and choose who should replace the Queen?The UK’s current immigration crisis - over the British subjects who arrived to work from the Caribbean as part of the ‘Windrush’ scheme, is an embarrassing disgrace during this week of Commonwealth ‘unity’.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe Windrush workers were invited to the UK to help rebuild Britain after the war, and are valued members of society. They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations, his life has been spent waiting on the sidelines, being indulged and spoilt, and his relationship with his children has only recently improved.          Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations His relationship with his former wife was disastrous. Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap?

Somewhere around 32,000ft, I heard a loud pop, as we all did. The flight attendants were in the aisle.   Needum was with his mother Julie and wife Stephanie at the press conference. They were on board the plane with him when the engine exploded and sent shrapnel through the passenger window next to Riordan who was sitting seven rows behind them. He fought tears as he told of the moments leading up to the emergency and stopped when he got to that point in the story          Needum, a trained firefighter and EMT, rushed to help ranch hand Tim McGinty who was trying to bring Riordan\u0027s body back into the aircraft. He said McGinty was his \u0027back up\u0027 on the flight and that he was a \u0027big guy\u0027\u0027I immediately looked to them and turned back around and the oxygen masks were deployed,\u0027 he said. Needum was sitting next to his father and his eight-year-old son was by the window.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, neck and torso. She is pictured with her husband MichaelThey all got their masks on and he turned to look at his wife, mother and five-year-old daughter who were sitting directly across the aisle to ensure they too were safe. Before he went back to help Riordan, he tried to help a young mother who was sitting behind his wife with her six-month-old daughter. She was struggling to put the baby\u0027s oxygen mask on and Needum wanted to help her. \u0027I sat back down and looked across the aisle to my wife after we heard some commotion in the rear of the plane. \u0027I looked at my wife, looked in her eyes, and she gave me the approval to go back there,\u0027 he said.  Like McGinty and Phillips, both of whom were hailed heroes for their efforts on board the flight, Needum said he did \u0027what anyone else would do.\u0027 \u0027I felt moved to act and as well as other people on that plane,\u0027 he said.           This harrowing image taken before the plane made its emergency landing shows the state of the exploded engine           \u0027She made a point of speaking to everyone\u0027: Pilot Tammie Jo Shults spoke to every passenger on the flight after making her emergency landing.

Needum and his wife Stephanie (above together) were in New York City with his parents and their son and daughter for a family vacation. They were on their way home to Texas when the engine exploded on the Southwest Airlines flight          Needum said retired nurse Peggy Phillips (shown above with McGinty once they had landed back in Dallas hours later) was a \u0027special lady\u0027 \u0027She comforted everybody. She did amazing, she is an amazing person,\u0027 Stephanie Needum said.  The couple\u0027s children were \u0027shaken\u0027 by the ordeal but are back at school with their friends, they said. Riordan\u0027s immediate family have been too distraught to speak at length. On Wednesday, her sister-in-law thanked Needum and McGinty for bringing her back into the aircraft because now they would be able to have closure with a proper burial.Investigators are still looking into what caused the engine failure. They have so far been able to determine that a fan blade separated as a result of metal fatigue at the hub and that it may have contributed to the malfunction.The Boeing 737-700 was tested three days before the flight.            This was the Row 14 seat which Riordan was sitting in when she was sucked towards the window at 32,00ft           Riordan\u0027s window was smashed by shrapnel from the exploding engine which was several rows in front of her and in fact, was directly beside the Needum family in Row 7"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/15/4B50DEAC00000578-0-image-a-22_1524146767781.jpg","title":"Mothers horror baby girl suffocated sleep 3ft tall TEDDY BEAR","story":"Dexy Leigh Walsh found her 18-month-old daughter Connie Rose dead beneath a teddy bearSpeaking today, the 23-year-old mum described the horror of finding her daughter on the morning of March 6.She said: \u0027It was just a normal school morning.

Boys on scrambler bikes have been tearing up the road outside the hospital as part of at times noisy protests to save Alfie\u0027For visitors, we have been advised to put additional measures in place so our patients and families are able to access vital services without limitation by others.\u0027For example tomorrow, visitors may see more security in the hospital and a more controlled approach to access to certain areas.\u0027This will help us maintain a flow to vital services, so please be patient.\u0027However, Alder Hey remains fully operational with A\u0026ampE open for urgent and emergency care\u0027.The latest demonstration comes on the eve of a court hearing over Alfie\u0027s future.The case is set to be heard in the Court of Appeal this morning after an emergency order was signed by a judge on Thursday night.Just days earlier, a date and time for the withdrawal of Alfie\u0027s medical support had been set. Pope Francis used his traditional Sunday blessing in St Peter\u0027s Square to say he\u0027s praying for British brain damaged toddler Alfie Evans. The pontiff said the situation is \u0027very painful and complex\u0027 as he spoke on Alfie and others who are terminally ill.He expressed hope that they\u0027re always respected in their dignity and cared for in a way suitable to their conditions, with the agreement of family members, doctors and health workers.\u0027  Monsignor Vincenzo Paglia, head of the Pontifical Academy of Life, a Vatican bioethics think tank, said yesterday that Alfie\u0027s parents and hospital officials should work together so his life isn\u0027t \u0027reduced to a legal dispute.\u0027Francis\u0027 comments mark the second time in less than a year that he has intervened in the case of a terminally ill British child. Around 50 people were filmed standing outside Alder Hey hospital last night in protest at a judges ruling in favour of switching off the child\u0027s life support.In the footage the group sing Hero by Mariah Carey as cars and vans sound their horns in support of the tiny tot.

The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested  There could be little doubt about the prevailing view among the members as they assembled at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning for the opening ceremony of the largest Commonwealth summit in the organisation\u0027s history.It came despite reports claiming that some Commonwealth leaders remain \u0027underwhelmed\u0027 by the Prince of Wales, while senior Labour figures, including leader Jeremy Corbyn, have questioned whether he should be honoured with the role.It fell to the Maltese prime minister, as the Commonwealth\u0027s outgoing chair-in-office, to speak on behalf of his colleagues.\u0027We are elated by the vigour with which the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs,\u0027 said Dr Joseph Muscat. \u0027We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0027It remains to be seen whether the leaders decide to formalise this intention in today\u0027s end-of-summit communique. Since there is no constitutional rule about the headship, there is no requirement to do so.And although there is no vacancy yet, this was still a landmark moment. The prince has been quietly assuming more and more of the monarch\u0027s duties – investitures, overseas tours and, most recently, honouring the fallen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.           The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things But the Commonwealth question has always been studiously avoided. The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested.Yet having visited 44 of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth (he has been to ten in the past year alone) and having known all its leaders since birth, he probably understands \u0027the club\u0027 better than anyone alive, with the exception of his parents.Yesterday he spoke fondly of what has been \u0027a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\u0027 and of bygone Commonwealth statesmen such as Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada, and Jomo Kenyatta, former president of Kenya. Both men\u0027s sons – Justin Trudeau and Uhuru Kenyatta – have since followed their fathers into politics. Both of them were seated on the stage yesterday with the other premiers. The Windsors are certainly not the only Commonwealth dynasty.The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things.Over nearly seven decades she has held this argumentative organisation-cum-clan together, listening to their troubles in endless private audiences, wining and dining them, breaking up fights and generally keeping the show on the road.But this was the nearest she has ever come to an instruction.Cleverly, she talked of the prince continuing her father\u0027s work as well as her own.  The Queen has told foreign dignitaries of her \u0027sincere wish\u0027 that they pick Prince Charles to take over as leader of the Commonwealth during a large summit at Buckingham Palace Commonwealth summits are unlike any other, not least because there are no interpreters. The family atmosphere was evident even before the start yesterday as the leaders gathered in the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.Usually, royal guests in the state apartments stand around nervously, trying not to touch anything. This lot swaggered in, many giving each other bear hugs, and cheerfully plonked themselves down on priceless sofas and chairs, making themselves thoroughly at home.It is one of the reasons why the Queen has always enjoyed these summits, and why there was an added poignancy to yesterday\u0027s proceedings. For this was a farewell of sorts – not that anyone put it quite like that.The Queen, who celebrates her 92nd birthday tomorrow, no longer undertakes long-haul travel. These Commonwealth summits, held every other year, take place in Britain only every 20 years or so. The next one is scheduled for Malaysia, and the Prince of Wales will represent the Queen there.She will continue to play an active part in Commonwealth affairs and meet its leaders when they are in Britain. But her days of far-away summits are over.It explains why this gathering had attracted the largest number of premiers in Commonwealth history, with 47 heads of government present among 53 delegations.She attended her first gathering of its leaders as a princess, when her father, King George VI, created the modern organisation out of the remnants of the British Empire. There were only eight members of the Commonwealth when the Queen came to the throne.          Britain\u0027s Prince Charles greets India\u0027s Prime Narendra Modi in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner on Thursday night In 1953, she was the dazzling debutante head surrounded by grand old stagers like Churchill, Menzies and Nehru. She would entertain the Commonwealth prime ministers on their annual trips to London until they decided to rotate these gatherings among the member nations. In 1971 the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or CHOGM) took place in Singapore.Prime Minister Edward Heath formally advised the Queen not to attend. He warned that there would be a row over British arms sales to South Africa and that there would be a toxic atmosphere – as indeed there was. The Commonwealth came close to imploding there and then.The Queen was adamant that she would never miss another one. She has been turning up ever since, holding her audiences, her banquets and her receptions (with the exception of 2013, when the new long-haul ban ruled out a journey to Sri Lanka). All through the 1970s and 80s, all through the bust-ups over Rhodesia and South Africa, she was there in the wings, defusing the tension, raising the tone, nudging the organisation towards consensus rather than polarisation.Along the way, the Commonwealth would enjoy great triumphs – notably the end of apartheid, the return of South Africa to \u0027the club\u0027 and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe fact that dozens of ex-colonies have maintained such a close bond with the once-loathed ex-imperial Crown has been, in no small part, down to the way the Queen has personally reframed that relationship.In recent years, the Commonwealth may have lost its way at a political level, eclipsed by a myriad of grander, flashier copycats – the G20, the EU and so on. Its critics suggest it is an outdated, clapped-out post-imperial has-been. But it still does its best work at the people-to-people level through numerous grass-roots associations, plugging away on tiny budgets.It has plenty of admirers and jealous rivals. The French have done their best to emulate it. There are many nations who want to join.This is a unique outfit with a unique character, forged through shared bonds of history, language, law and sacrifice. Last night\u0027s dinner was proof of that. State banquets at the Palace always have a U-shaped table with the Queen at the top. Not this one.     Last night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt Missing his Markle: Harry and William join the Queen as she...British fishing firm can appeal against a controversial...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...King of Swaziland renames the country Kingdom of eSwatini to...Share this articleLast night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt. She sat between Dr Muscat of Malta and president Adama Barrow of The Gambia (now a Commonwealth member once more, having recently ejected the madman who used to be in charge).All the Royal Family were there, with the exception of a convalescing Prince Philip and a heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Spread all around the Picture Gallery was that old ex-imperial family to which the Queen pledged herself on her 21st birthday.By tradition, a summit newcomer had been invited to raise the toast to the Queen at the black tie banquet. President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana struck a somewhat melancholy note as he expressed \u0027our collective regret that she will no longer automatically be present at our proceedings\u0027.But he voiced a \u0027fervent hope\u0027 that \u0027her deep love for this association will continue to light the way for all of us\u0027. The party is far from over, however.Today this lot head for their summit \u0027retreat\u0027 at Windsor Castle – where the Queen will have a more intimate lunchtime bash for them.

Comey, who is on a book tour promoting A Higher Loyalty, wrote the memos because he was bothered by the nature of his conversations with TrumpTrump is also said to have told Comey that he wanted the FBI and the Department of Justice to make a public statement indicating that the president was not under investigation.   According to memos maintained by Comey and obtained by The Associated Press, Trump and his chief of staff asked days later if Flynn\u0027s communications were being monitored under a secret surveillance warrant.The documents had been eagerly anticipated since their existence was first revealed last year, especially since Comey\u0027s interactions with Trump are part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s investigation into whether the president sought to obstruct justice. The memos have been turned over to Mueller.Comey has said publicly that, \u0027I knew there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened, not just to defend myself, but to defend the FBI and our integrity as an institution and the independence of our investigative function.\u0027According to one memo, Trump complained about Flynn at a private January 2017 dinner with Comey, saying \u0027the guy has serious judgment issues.\u0027 He then blamed Flynn for a delay in returning the congratulatory call of an international leader, telling Comey he would be upset if he had to wait six days for a returned phone call.Trump asked James Comey if his No. 2 at the FBI Andrew...Share this article\u0027I did not comment at any point during this topic and there was no mention or acknowledgment of any FBI interest in or contact with General Flynn,\u0027 Comey wrote.At that point, the FBI had already interviewed Flynn about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and the Justice Department had already warned White House officials that they were concerned Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail.Flynn was fired February 13, 2017, after White House officials said he had misled them about his Russian contacts during the transition period. In a separate memo, Comey says Trump cleared the Oval Office of other officials, encouraged him to let the investigation into Flynn go and called him a good guy.The memos reveal that days before Flynn\u0027s firing, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus asked Comey if Flynn\u0027s communications were being monitored under a secret surveillance warrant.\u0027Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?\u0027 Priebus asked Comey, according to the memos, referring to an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.Comey said he \u0027paused for a few seconds and then said that I would answer here, but that this illustrated the kind of question that had been asked and answered through established channels.\u0027Comey\u0027s response is redacted on the unclassified memos.The memos were provided to Congress earlier Thursday as House Republicans escalated criticism of the Justice Department, threatening to subpoena the documents and questioning officials.     The 15 pages of documents contain new details about a series of interactions with Trump that Comey found so unnerving that he documented them in writing          Those encounters in the weeks before Comey\u0027s May 2017 firing include a Trump Tower discussion involving allegations of prostitutes and Russia and a White House dinner at which Comey says Trump asked him for his loyalty          It also included a private Oval Office discussion where the ex-FBI head says the president asked him to end an investigation into Michael Flynn          According to one memo, Trump complained about Flynn at a private January 2017 dinner with Comey, saying \u0027the guy has serious judgment issues\u0027

wrote in the letter that the department \u0027consulted the relevant parties\u0027 and concluded that releasing the memos would not adversely affect any ongoing investigations. Mueller is investigating potential ties between Russia and Trump\u0027s 2016 campaign as well as possible obstruction of justice by the president.Boyd said the decision to allow the release of the memos

One in five admit they speed for the thrill of driving so quickly.Rob Miles, director of car insurance at Direct Line said: \u0027Speeding is one of the biggest causes of accidents and casualties on UK roads. The research suggests that it is often not deliberate, as drivers may be unaware that they may are creeping above the limit. However, speed limits are set for a reason and 20mph and 30mph zones are often around schools, hospitals and other highly pedestrianised zones, where going over the limit could prove fatal in the event of an accident.\u0027The findings come amid calls from a senior police officer to get rid of the 10 per cent \u0027buffer\u0027 over the signposted limit that most police forces allow.          Millions believe there are \u0027acceptable\u0027 upper speeds they can drive at above the limitThey are typically given another 2mph allowance above this level.This leeway, which also applies to those caught on camera, is equivalent to being allowed to travel at 68mph in a 60mph zone or 35 mph in a 30mph zone.But earlier this year the chief constable of West Mercia police force Anthony Bangham said the days of the \u0027soft\u0027 treatment of offenders must come to an end.Mr Bangham, who is the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council lead on road policy, sparked a backlash from motoring campaigners and MPs for appearing to suggest that drivers should be given a ticket for travelling just 1mph over the speed limit.Mr Bangham quickly backtracked and said his comments had been misunderstood.EXCLUSIVE: Black man arrested in Starbucks was a repeat...Driver jailed for 12 years for running over pedestrian\u0027s...\u0027Ain\u0027t nobody got time for this!\u0027 911 operator is jailed for...Share this articleAnthony Bangham admitted punishing drivers for straying just one mph over the limit would not be \u0027proportionate or achievable\u0027.But speeding remains a huge problem.The equivalent of four people a minute were caught speeding in 2016, according to figures from the Home Office.In 2016 a total of 1.97 million fixed penalty notices were issued for speed limit offences across England and Wales, an extra 25,000 compared to 2015 and 107,000 compared to 2014.The most recent figures available from the Department for Transport show there were 1,792 road deaths reported in 2016 - up 4 per cent from 2015 and the highest annual total since 2011. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/01/4B558DA000000578-0-image-m-50_1524183195220.jpg","title":"UK proposals Irish border Brexit rejected Brussels report","story":"Exclusive: EU rejects Theresa May\u0027s Brexit Irish border solution as doubts grow over whether UK can leave customs union"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/00/4B41FFB300000578-0-image-a-5_1524181599124.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS yesterday Parliament Yikes rude MPs","story":"    Sir William Cash asked John Bercow, pictured, asked whether trolling MPs was Contempt of Parliament whether they are abused outside or inside the house          Sir William raised the anti-Semitic abuse suffered by Labour\u0027s Ruth Smeeth, picturedHe noted the anti-Semitic abuse aimed at Labour MPs – including Stoke North’s Ruth Smeeth and Liverpool Wavertree’s Luciana Berger. Bassetlaw’s John Mann has also been given an appallingly rough time but he, being a man, receives less sympathy than Misses Smeeth and Berger.Sir William’s point of order went thus: given the ‘outrageous abuse and intimidation levelled’ at these MPs, did Speaker John Bercow see ‘sufficient evidence of a Contempt of the House’? Sir William, who is among other things a country solicitor, said that the parliamentary manual ‘Erskine May’ stated it was a Contempt of Parliament ‘to molest and intimidate Members by abusive language outside or inside the precincts of the House’.

His...Share this articleThe Speaker said there could indeed be such a case but he would need to take advice before issuing any verdict. If Sir William wished to pursue the matter, he should write to him. Mr Bercow said there was ‘a concern to protect the rights of all members of the House – any members could be similarly affected’.You may ask: what is ‘Contempt of the House’ and what are the associated penalties? Contempt may be misusing the parliamentary portcullis motif or it may be passing yourself off as a parliamentary agent. It is a Contempt of the Commons to leak details of a select committee report, to be ‘disorderly or disrespectful’ on the parliamentary estate or in one of its committees, or to obstruct MPs or parliamentary officials in their duties.In the past, the House has summoned offenders to the ‘Bar of the House’ (ie the edge of the Chamber) for a reprimand. That happened in 1957 to the feisty Sunday Express editor Sir John Junor after he suggested MPs had dodged petrol rationing. Contempt culprits have also been fined and locked up in the Palace of Westminster gaol.The last to suffer that fate, in 1880, was one Charles Grizzell, a former naval lieutenant who publicly suggested he could ‘control’ a Commons committee. Modern lobbyists, please note.Grizzell legged it to Boulogne, so the Serjeant at Arms locked up his lawyer instead. See? Lawyers do have their uses.If Speaker Bercow is obliged to look into the contempt issue by Sir William, he will find that 1880’s clock-tower cell is now used for different purposes. Speaker’s Counsel may also advise him that compliance with various human rights laws may have made it harder for the Commons to impose its authority on scurvy members of the public.All this is less academic than it might sound. Only this week, the Culture select committee was flicked a V-sign by Alexander Nix of data company Cambridge Analytica. The committee wanted him to give evidence at a hearing. He told it to get stuffed. There remains an uneasy stand-off, parliamentary clerks at present just muttering dark threats.For sketchwriters – and any others who feel today’s politicians sometimes deserve raspberries (though never to the degree aimed at MPs Smeeth \u0026amp Co), this ice feels thin. A Commons factsheet says Contempt of the House may include ‘reflections on the character or impartiality of the Speaker or Deputy Speakers’.Yikes. Speaker Bercow and his predecessor have done to the Chair’s dignity what Uri Geller used to do to teaspoons. Bercow’s impartiality can be as skimpy as Borat’s thong.We may condemn recent abuse of MPs. Let it be examined for illegality under incitement laws. But in an age when parliamentarians have drifted so far from the voters, it would be a mistake to revive the notion of Contempt of the House."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/16/4B48725F00000578-0-image-a-8_1524066130829.jpg","title":"Deliveroo effect seen Brits splurge takeaways soar 73 CENT","story":"    The \u0027Deliveroo-effect\u0027 has seen a 73per cent surge in the money spent on home delivery of takeaways in 10 years, taking the figure to £4.2billion (file photo)There were some 673million deliveries in the past year, which is equivalent to ten for every person in the country, according to research by market analysts at the NPD Group.Chinese was the most popular at 179 million, ahead of pizza at 171m, burgers at 82m and curry at 70m.Pizza\u0027s share of the market is falling while the home delivery of burgers is rising rapidly, led by the fact that even McDonald\u0027s now has a tie-up with delivery firms.McDonald\u0027s refused to serve paramedics on the night shift...Sainsbury\u0027s DROP Classic Coke from its £3 meal deal blaming...Share this articleNPD said there were 60per cent more home deliveries of burgers in 2017 than in 2016.

Blades that fail inspection would need to be replaced.It was not immediately clear how many planes would be affected. Last year, the FAA estimated that an order would cover 220 engines on U.S. airlines. That number could be higher now because more engines have hit the number of flights triggering an inspection.Southwest announced its own program for similar inspections of its 700-plane fleet over the next month. United Airlines executives said Wednesday that they had begun inspecting some of their planes.  Southwest announced its own program for similar inspections of its 700-plane fleet over the next month. United Airlines executives said Wednesday that they had begun inspecting some of their planes. American Airlines has about 300 planes with that type of engine, and Delta Air Lines has about 185. It will not be clear until the FAA issues its rule how many will need inspections.Tuesday\u0027s emergency broke a string of eight straight years without a fatal accident involving a U.S. airliner.Engine failures like this should not occur, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the NTSB, said Wednesday.Sumwalt expressed concern about such a destructive engine failure but said he would not yet draw broad conclusions about the safety of CFM56 engines or the entire fleet of Boeing 737s, the most popular airliner ever built.Federal investigators were still trying to determine how a window came out of the plane. The woman sitting next to it, identified by family members as 43-year-old Jennifer Riordan, was wearing a seat belt. Philadelphia\u0027s medical examiner said the banking executive and mother of two from Albuquerque, New Mexico, died from blunt impact trauma to her head, neck and torso.It is unknown whether the FAA\u0027s original directive would have forced Southwest to quickly inspect the engine that blew up. CEO Gary Kelly said it had logged only 10,000 cycles since being overhauled.  The window that was shattered after a jet engine of a Southwest Airlines airplane blew out at altitude, resulting in the death of a woman who was nearly sucked from the windowBefore Wednesday\u0027s announcement, critics accused the FAA of inaction in the face of a threat to safety.Robert Clifford, a lawyer who is suing American Airlines over another engine explosion that caused a fire that destroyed the plane, said the FAA should have required the inspections - even if it meant grounding Boeing 737s.There is something going on with these engines, he said, and the statistical likelihood of additional failures exists.William Waldock, a safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, predicted the FAA\u0027s decision. He said the scope of FAA action will depend on whether investigators find fatigue in other fan blades on the broken engine.The first thing they probably are going to do is pull every single one of those other blades off and X-ray them to see if they\u0027ve got a similar type of failure waiting to happen, he said.The Southwest CEO protested that it is too soon to say whether Tuesday\u0027s accident is related to any other engine failures.Kelly said the plane was inspected on Sunday and nothing appeared out of order. A spokeswoman said it was a visual inspection and oil service of the engines. The NTSB\u0027s Sumwalt said, however, that the kind of wear seen where the missing fan blade broke off would not have been visible just by looking at the engine.In this Tuesday, April 17, 2018 frame from video, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator examines damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane that made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/10/4B4F6DF800000578-0-image-m-49_1524130292624.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Charles replace mother head Commonwealth","story":"    Prince Charles dons a traditional feather headband for an Aboriginal welcome ceremony in AustraliaThe 53 men and women who gathered in the lavish state rooms at Buckingham Palace this week knew what was coming - the Royal family has been mounting a charm offensive for months, culminating in Prince Charles touring Australia in searing heat.He even wore a white feather head dress to meet tribal elders, although he refused to remove his shoes or shed his suit on the beach.The Queen has just opened the formal meeting of the Commonwealth Heads with a heart-felt plea for her eldest son to take over her role as their leader, declaring that it was her ‘sincere wish’ that they vote for Charles to succeed her.

Her majesty and the heir to the throne (pictured together) are followed out of the ballroom by the Duchess of Wales following today\u0027s Commonwealth summitNow, at 92 on Saturday, she’s anxious to step down, and gave up long-haul travel in 2013.Unlike most of the Commonwealth leaders, Elizabeth was born into immense privilege - she inherited wealth and far-flung places that have few ties to the United Kingdom.There are plenty of reasons why the Commonwealth should not work as a loose grouping of states - but amazingly, it continues to survive, providing a useful forum which draws countries together, rather than apart.Given that the British throne rules a diminishing number of Commonwealth nations - why should the next leader come from the House of Windsor?Would it not be fairer to let the Commonwealth Heads of Government hold a secret ballot and choose who should replace the Queen?The UK’s current immigration crisis - over the British subjects who arrived to work from the Caribbean as part of the ‘Windrush’ scheme, is an embarrassing disgrace during this week of Commonwealth ‘unity’.

They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate?

Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap?

The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested  There could be little doubt about the prevailing view among the members as they assembled at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning for the opening ceremony of the largest Commonwealth summit in the organisation\u0027s history.It came despite reports claiming that some Commonwealth leaders remain \u0027underwhelmed\u0027 by the Prince of Wales, while senior Labour figures, including leader Jeremy Corbyn, have questioned whether he should be honoured with the role.It fell to the Maltese prime minister, as the Commonwealth\u0027s outgoing chair-in-office, to speak on behalf of his colleagues.\u0027We are elated by the vigour with which the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs,\u0027 said Dr Joseph Muscat. \u0027We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0027It remains to be seen whether the leaders decide to formalise this intention in today\u0027s end-of-summit communique. Since there is no constitutional rule about the headship, there is no requirement to do so.And although there is no vacancy yet, this was still a landmark moment. The prince has been quietly assuming more and more of the monarch\u0027s duties – investitures, overseas tours and, most recently, honouring the fallen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.           The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things But the Commonwealth question has always been studiously avoided. The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested.Yet having visited 44 of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth (he has been to ten in the past year alone) and having known all its leaders since birth, he probably understands \u0027the club\u0027 better than anyone alive, with the exception of his parents.Yesterday he spoke fondly of what has been \u0027a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\u0027 and of bygone Commonwealth statesmen such as Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada, and Jomo Kenyatta, former president of Kenya. Both men\u0027s sons – Justin Trudeau and Uhuru Kenyatta – have since followed their fathers into politics. Both of them were seated on the stage yesterday with the other premiers. The Windsors are certainly not the only Commonwealth dynasty.The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things.Over nearly seven decades she has held this argumentative organisation-cum-clan together, listening to their troubles in endless private audiences, wining and dining them, breaking up fights and generally keeping the show on the road.But this was the nearest she has ever come to an instruction.Cleverly, she talked of the prince continuing her father\u0027s work as well as her own.  The Queen has told foreign dignitaries of her \u0027sincere wish\u0027 that they pick Prince Charles to take over as leader of the Commonwealth during a large summit at Buckingham Palace Commonwealth summits are unlike any other, not least because there are no interpreters. The family atmosphere was evident even before the start yesterday as the leaders gathered in the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.Usually, royal guests in the state apartments stand around nervously, trying not to touch anything. This lot swaggered in, many giving each other bear hugs, and cheerfully plonked themselves down on priceless sofas and chairs, making themselves thoroughly at home.It is one of the reasons why the Queen has always enjoyed these summits, and why there was an added poignancy to yesterday\u0027s proceedings. For this was a farewell of sorts – not that anyone put it quite like that.The Queen, who celebrates her 92nd birthday tomorrow, no longer undertakes long-haul travel. These Commonwealth summits, held every other year, take place in Britain only every 20 years or so. The next one is scheduled for Malaysia, and the Prince of Wales will represent the Queen there.She will continue to play an active part in Commonwealth affairs and meet its leaders when they are in Britain. But her days of far-away summits are over.It explains why this gathering had attracted the largest number of premiers in Commonwealth history, with 47 heads of government present among 53 delegations.She attended her first gathering of its leaders as a princess, when her father, King George VI, created the modern organisation out of the remnants of the British Empire. There were only eight members of the Commonwealth when the Queen came to the throne.          Britain\u0027s Prince Charles greets India\u0027s Prime Narendra Modi in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner on Thursday night In 1953, she was the dazzling debutante head surrounded by grand old stagers like Churchill, Menzies and Nehru. She would entertain the Commonwealth prime ministers on their annual trips to London until they decided to rotate these gatherings among the member nations. In 1971 the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or CHOGM) took place in Singapore.Prime Minister Edward Heath formally advised the Queen not to attend. He warned that there would be a row over British arms sales to South Africa and that there would be a toxic atmosphere – as indeed there was. The Commonwealth came close to imploding there and then.The Queen was adamant that she would never miss another one. She has been turning up ever since, holding her audiences, her banquets and her receptions (with the exception of 2013, when the new long-haul ban ruled out a journey to Sri Lanka). All through the 1970s and 80s, all through the bust-ups over Rhodesia and South Africa, she was there in the wings, defusing the tension, raising the tone, nudging the organisation towards consensus rather than polarisation.Along the way, the Commonwealth would enjoy great triumphs – notably the end of apartheid, the return of South Africa to \u0027the club\u0027 and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe fact that dozens of ex-colonies have maintained such a close bond with the once-loathed ex-imperial Crown has been, in no small part, down to the way the Queen has personally reframed that relationship.In recent years, the Commonwealth may have lost its way at a political level, eclipsed by a myriad of grander, flashier copycats – the G20, the EU and so on. Its critics suggest it is an outdated, clapped-out post-imperial has-been. But it still does its best work at the people-to-people level through numerous grass-roots associations, plugging away on tiny budgets.It has plenty of admirers and jealous rivals. The French have done their best to emulate it. There are many nations who want to join.This is a unique outfit with a unique character, forged through shared bonds of history, language, law and sacrifice. Last night\u0027s dinner was proof of that. State banquets at the Palace always have a U-shaped table with the Queen at the top. Not this one.     Last night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt Missing his Markle: Harry and William join the Queen as she...British fishing firm can appeal against a controversial...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...King of Swaziland renames the country Kingdom of eSwatini to...Share this articleLast night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt. She sat between Dr Muscat of Malta and president Adama Barrow of The Gambia (now a Commonwealth member once more, having recently ejected the madman who used to be in charge).All the Royal Family were there, with the exception of a convalescing Prince Philip and a heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Spread all around the Picture Gallery was that old ex-imperial family to which the Queen pledged herself on her 21st birthday.By tradition, a summit newcomer had been invited to raise the toast to the Queen at the black tie banquet. President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana struck a somewhat melancholy note as he expressed \u0027our collective regret that she will no longer automatically be present at our proceedings\u0027.But he voiced a \u0027fervent hope\u0027 that \u0027her deep love for this association will continue to light the way for all of us\u0027. The party is far from over, however.Today this lot head for their summit \u0027retreat\u0027 at Windsor Castle – where the Queen will have a more intimate lunchtime bash for them.

Comey, who is on a book tour promoting A Higher Loyalty, wrote the memos because he was bothered by the nature of his conversations with TrumpTrump is also said to have told Comey that he wanted the FBI and the Department of Justice to make a public statement indicating that the president was not under investigation.   According to memos maintained by Comey and obtained by The Associated Press, Trump and his chief of staff asked days later if Flynn\u0027s communications were being monitored under a secret surveillance warrant.The documents had been eagerly anticipated since their existence was first revealed last year, especially since Comey\u0027s interactions with Trump are part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s investigation into whether the president sought to obstruct justice. The memos have been turned over to Mueller.Comey has said publicly that, \u0027I knew there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened, not just to defend myself, but to defend the FBI and our integrity as an institution and the independence of our investigative function.\u0027According to one memo, Trump complained about Flynn at a private January 2017 dinner with Comey, saying \u0027the guy has serious judgment issues.\u0027 He then blamed Flynn for a delay in returning the congratulatory call of an international leader, telling Comey he would be upset if he

mention or acknowledgment of any FBI interest in or contact with General Flynn,\u0027 Comey wrote.At that point, the FBI had already interviewed Flynn about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and the Justice Department had already warned White House officials that they were concerned Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail.Flynn was fired February 13, 2017, after White House officials said he had misled them about his Russian contacts during the transition period. In a separate memo, Comey says Trump cleared the Oval Office of other officials, encouraged him to let the investigation into Flynn go and called him a good guy.The memos reveal that days before Flynn\u0027s firing, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus asked Comey if Flynn\u0027s communications were being monitored under a secret surveillance warrant.\u0027Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?\u0027 Priebus asked Comey, according to the memos, referring to an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.Comey said he \u0027paused for a few seconds and then said that I would answer here, but that this illustrated the kind of question that had been asked and answered through established channels.\u0027Comey\u0027s response is redacted on the unclassified memos.The memos were provided to Congress earlier Thursday as House Republicans escalated criticism of the Justice Department, threatening to subpoena the documents and questioning officials.     The 15 pages of documents contain new details about a series of interactions with Trump that Comey found so unnerving that he documented them in writing          Those encounters in the weeks before Comey\u0027s May 2017 firing include a Trump Tower discussion involving allegations of prostitutes and Russia

Bassetlaw’s John Mann has also been given an appallingly rough time but he, being a man, receives less sympathy than Misses Smeeth and Berger.Sir William’s point of order went thus: given the ‘outrageous abuse and intimidation levelled’ at these MPs, did Speaker John Bercow see ‘sufficient evidence of a Contempt of the House’? Sir William, who is among other things a country solicitor, said that the parliamentary manual ‘Erskine May’ stated it was a Contempt of Parliament ‘to molest and intimidate Members by abusive language outside or inside the precincts of the House’. Sir William wondered if recent internet trolling constituted ‘a prima facie case for Contempt of the House’.Sir Alan Parker quits as international chairman of Save the...Was loneliness behind Dale Winton\u0027s tragic death at 62? His...Share this articleThe Speaker said there could indeed be such a case but he would need to take advice before issuing any verdict. If Sir William wished to pursue the matter, he should write to him. Mr Bercow said there was ‘a concern to protect the rights of all members of the House – any members could be similarly affected’.You may ask: what is ‘Contempt of the House’ and what are the associated penalties? Contempt may be misusing the parliamentary portcullis motif or it may be passing yourself off as a parliamentary agent. It is a Contempt of the Commons to leak details of a select committee report, to be ‘disorderly or disrespectful’ on the parliamentary estate or in one of its committees, or to obstruct MPs or parliamentary officials in their duties.In the past, the House has summoned offenders to the ‘Bar of the House’ (ie the edge of the Chamber) for a reprimand. That happened in 1957 to the feisty Sunday Express editor Sir John Junor after he suggested MPs had dodged petrol rationing. Contempt culprits have also been fined and locked up in the Palace of Westminster gaol.The last to suffer that fate, in 1880, was one Charles Grizzell, a former naval lieutenant who publicly suggested he could ‘control’ a Commons committee. Modern lobbyists, please note.Grizzell legged it to Boulogne, so the Serjeant at Arms locked up his lawyer instead. See? Lawyers do have their uses.If Speaker Bercow is obliged to look into the contempt issue by Sir William, he will find that 1880’s clock-tower cell is now used for different purposes. Speaker’s Counsel may also advise him that compliance with various human rights laws may have made it harder for the Commons to impose its authority on scurvy members of the public.All this is less academic than it might sound. Only this week, the Culture select committee was flicked a V-sign by Alexander Nix of data company Cambridge Analytica. The committee wanted him to give evidence at a hearing. He told it to get stuffed. There remains an uneasy stand-off, parliamentary clerks at present just muttering dark threats.For sketchwriters – and any others who feel today’s politicians sometimes deserve raspberries (though never to the degree aimed at MPs Smeeth \u0026amp Co), this ice feels thin. A Commons factsheet says Contempt of the House may include ‘reflections on the character or impartiality of the Speaker or Deputy Speakers’.Yikes. Speaker Bercow and his predecessor have done to the Chair’s dignity what Uri Geller used to do to teaspoons. Bercow’s impartiality can be as skimpy as Borat’s thong.We may condemn recent abuse of MPs. Let it be examined for illegality under incitement laws. But in an age when parliamentarians have drifted so far from the voters, it would be a mistake to revive the notion of Contempt of the House."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/00/4B5549D000000578-0-image-m-89_1524179025556.jpg","title":"Pale gaunt Prince seen visiting doctor check up","story":"   Another piece of evidence that shows Prince\u0027s deteriorating condition in the weeks leading up to his death comes in the form of text messages exchanged between Dr Schulenberg and Johnson.  The messages show Johnson contacted Schulenberg on April 7, 2016 because Prince wasn\u0027t feeling well and wanted fluids. He wrote that Prince was supposed to \u0027fly out today for a show.

It is their hard work and dedication that connects households, communities and companies across the UK every day.Royal Mail has announced that Moya Greene will step down as chief executive in June, after more than eight years in the job.The Canadian oversaw the privatisation of Royal Mail in 2013 and has “transformed” the business according to chairman Peter Long.Greene will be replaced by Rico Back, chief executive of Royal Mail’s European subsidiary, General Logistics Systems. Announcing the changes, Long said: Royal Mail was highly fortunate to recruit Moya, given her direct experience, strategic vision, drive and proven track record across a range of industry sectors.

The UK’s FTSE 100 is outperforming its major European peers this morning as it benefits from a weaker pound.The Barclays board is giving its full support to chief executive Jes Staley this morning, despite regulators concluding that he breached conduct by trying to discover the identity of a whisteblower.From the Barclays statement: The Barclays board continues to have unanimous confidence in Mr Staley and continues to recommend his re- election as a director at the Barclays annual general meeting on 1 May 2018. As set out in the April 2017 announcement, the Barclays board will determine what adjustment to Mr Staley’s compensation is appropriate once the FCA and PRA processes have concluded. Barclays’ chief executive Jes Staley is to be fined by UK regulators over his attempt to uncover the identity of a whistleblower in 2016, the bank revealed this morning.It is not yet clear how much Staley will be fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which have so far issued the boss with “draft warning notices”.The regulators have stopped short of saying that Staley is not fit or proper to run the bank.It follows Staley’s admission that he had tried to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate he had brought to the bank.Staley twice attempted to use Barclay’s internal security team to track down the authors of two anonymous letters sent to the board and a senior executive at the bank in June 2016. Here is an extract from the statement from Barclays this morning:In respect of Mr Staley, the FCA and PRA have recently issued confidential draft warning notices setting out their reasons for proposing enforcement actions. The FCA and PRA are alleging that Mr Staley’s actions in relation to this matter represented a breach of Inidual Conduct Rule 2 (requirement to act with due skill, care and diligence) and each have proposed that he pay a financial penalty. The FCA and PRA are not alleging that he acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as group chief executive officer. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.The pound is down this morning after Bank of England governor Mark Carney hinted that market expectations that interest rates would rise in May were overblown.However, Carney told the BBC last night that the MPC were not fixed on a particular month for raising rates and pointed to some softer UK data, such as retail sales.Here’s what he had to say:Prepare for a few interest rate rises over the next few years,” he told me.I don’t want to get too focused on the precise timing, it is more about the general path.We have had some mixed data. On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer - we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street.We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round. I am sure there will be some differences of view but it is a view we will take in early May, conscious that there are other meetings over the course of this year.Stay with us for all the day’s economic and financial news"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373f24341005031be71cb93c2d74de6ce6fece7e/0_0_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=edf86b5887a27db460ea82bc7823360e 1240w","title":"pollution pods let you sample smog beijing and delhi air london somerset house michael pinsky","story":"New installation at Somerset House in London lets visitors experience the air of some pollution hotspots – plus a pristine Norwegian islandNew Delhi: the suffocating smell of old cars and industry. São Paulo: enough ethanol to make your eyes water. And in London, a scent called Living Diesel.Those are the dominant notes of those cities’ contaminated air, according to an “artist’s approximation” that aims to raise awareness of the problem of pollution around the world.Londoners are invited to taste the air of some of the world’s most polluted cities – including their own – inside British artist Michael Pinsky’s Pollution Pods, on display in the courtyard of Somerset House.Inside the ring of five linked domes, Pinsky has safely recreated five different atmospheres, from the pristine peninsula of Tautra island in Norway to smoggy Beijing.Each pod is climatically controlled to emulate the temperature and the air quality – as well as the fragrance – of each destination, inviting visitors to compare the quality of global polluted environments. “I have tried to distil the whole bodily sense of being in each place,” Pinsky has said of his work.Three column heaters channel the oppressive heat of New Delhi, while a haze machine shoots out plumes of “smog”, which hangs in the pod, acrid and visible. No one lingers there, instead pressing on to the comparative comfort of “Beijing”.“Not too bad,” observes one visitor passing through, as though at a wine tasting.To recreate the polluted atmosphere of São Paulo, Pinsky evoked the ethanol-based fuel used in many cars in the megacity, which produces ozone and formaldehyde when it breaks down in the atmosphere. “The sensation is to try and make your eyes water, almost,” says Stephanie Pilling, a spokeswoman for Somerset House.Pinsky’s artist’s approximation of each environment was informed by his own visits and scientific findings on their different pollutants, then created with the help of specialists such as the London-based scent expert Laurin Taylor, says Pilling. “In the London room there’s a scent called Living Diesel, as the main cause of air pollution here is cars.”The clean air of Tautra island, Norway, was recreated in collaboration with Airlabs, an air purification company, which stripped it of pollutants. “That is the cleanest air you can find anywhere in London,” says Pilling, gesturing to the entry pod. “It’s better to be standing in there than it is in the courtyard, essentially.”Two young women entering the Tautra pod from São Paulo’s make a beeline for the air purifier. “Breathe it in,” sighs one, leaning into the blast of pristine air.Pinsky was commissioned to make Pollution Pods by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, for the Climart project, studying how visual art might impact perceptions of climate change. It was brought to London by Somerset House ahead of Earth Day on Sunday.Visitors are advised on entry that the Pollution Pods “may not be a suitable environment” for those who suffer from respiratory conditions, have adverse reactions to enclosed spaces or are accompanied by small children or babies. They are also offered an information sheet of practical ways to reduce exposure to air pollution in London.Pilling says Pinsky’s aim was to encourage people to be mindful of the issue of air pollution and to consider the impact of their consumerism on heavily polluted cities in India and China.“Some people have said the New Delhi pod is just unbearable,” adds Pilling. “But that’s what people experience every single day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54dc94c75de27f17fd646f26671219931083411/0_0_1365_819/master/1365.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=707b8aaecedf88533c69ef587eb319ff 1240w","title":"the guardian view on stephen lawrence we owe his parents better","story":"It is 25 years since a tragedy and crime evolved into a national scandal. Two of the five original suspects in the racist murder of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence were jailed almost two decades later, following advances in forensic science, but Scotland Yard says it has no further leads. The time it took to secure those convictions, and the fact that some of his killers remain free, is directly related to the second outrage that followed Stephen’s murder: the appalling failure of police to bring those responsible to account, and their shocking treatment of his family and his friend Duwayne Brooks, with him that terrible night, which extended even to spying on them. Only the extraordinary determination of Stephen’s parents, Doreen and Neville, confronted the wider public with the reality of racism both on the streets and within the state, and brought to light officers’ bias, sheer incompetence and alleged links to criminals. (The Guardian today reports fresh claims about those connections.) In 1999, the resulting Macpherson report exposed the institutional racism of police and forced a broader reckoning.The powerful BBC documentary series Stephen: the Murder that Changed a Nation captures these events in full. But it also shows how limited and slow progress has been. Lady Lawrence has repeatedly warned that racism still blights Britain, with discrimination persisting not only in the justice system but also education, housing and employment. This week the family’s solicitor, Imran Khan, revealed their shock on hearing an officer who had won their confidence dismiss the notion that the Metropolitan police as a whole was racist as “utter rubbish” and call Lady Lawrence ungrateful. “You cannot help but think that the improvements we so wanted to see were only skin deep,” Mr Khan wrote.Racism is not about the behaviour of an inidual but structures, he noted: the institutions and society that frame, shape and respond to it. Discussing how the 50-year-old “rivers of blood” speech by Enoch Powell – admired by members of the gang that killed Stephen – legitimised physical attacks, he added: “It\u0026nbspis politicians who set the parameters of how society behaves. It immediately filtered down.”The Macpherson report initially made public figures more careful in addressing race, and compelled institutions to face their shortcomings. Leaders had to decide whether they would tackle the worst instincts of society head-on, tolerate them as inevitable – or pander to them. As home secretary, Theresa May in some regards took up that challenge and showed a courage that predecessors lacked: calling police “too white”, criticising their use of stop and search, and meeting with the relatives of people who had died in custody.But on immigration, political rhetoric has since turned for the worse. And immigration is inextricably connected to race relations the rise in hate crimes after the Brexit vote hit not only European migrants but also British-born black and Asian citizens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b514a2430d4e80dca200002e5b5efc9084e3dc4d/0_428_5687_3412/master/5687.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=28bb12a452ffa0e3746d391fb31b1f99 1240w","title":"ant mcpartlin ant and dec drink drive case celebrity fame dark side","story":"Ant McPartlin’s celebrity has been built on a perennially boyish, cheeky-chappy image, always at ease in front of the camera. The image he presented following his sentencing for drink-driving, after a collision in which other people were injured, could not have been more different. Gaunt face, furrowed brow, and dark bags under worried eyes, he looked in no fit state to have cameras shoved in his face. But a press that has built him up is not going to miss the opportunity for close-up scrutiny of his downfall to addiction and depression. His haggard face covered front pages: “Ant’s court shame”, “Ant’s guilt”, “Shamefaced!” chorused the captions. The Daily Mail had the nastiest dig at its former darling: “A picture of self-pity, drink drive Ant fined £86,000 (and that’s just 4 days’ wages).”These same papers have recently reported, with approval, attempts to improve the treatment of mental health, including Theresa May’s rhetorical promise to transform how the issue is dealt with. But when it comes to their relationship with celebrities, self-awareness and responsible reporting of psychological distress is too\u0026nbspmuch to expect.Celebrities are the lifeblood of much of our popular journalism, and ambivalence is the name of the game. Personalities are elevated through endless attention to every detail of their lives – look no further than the current obsession with Meghan Markle’s every outfit, her dogs’ names and her estranged relatives.But this is envious attention, waiting – even hoping – for the celebrity to crash and suffer, or to behave in ways that will justify spiteful commentary. When celebrities really come down to earth, or even die, there is a ghoulish interest in the details of their suffering, especially if there’s a suggestion that they were, after all, not happy with their previously enviable celebrity lives. The bear-baiting treatment of Amy Winehouse and Frank Bruno were examples of this. Dale Winton’s death this week offers the opportunity for a sort of voyeuristic interest in the details of his depression.Ant, particularly as part of Ant and Dec, plays an interesting role in the machinery of British celebrity. The duo’s core television work has been precisely in the area of celebrity making and breaking. They are the front team for Britain’s Got Talent, a show where celebrities are discovered among “ordinary” people and become fodder for the popular press. The pair’s sensitive handling of Susan Boyle after her first performance turned her into a megastar. But they also front I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, where famous people are tested and hopefully – from the perspective of “good” television – broken. Created or destroyed, all of it feeds the needs of the celebrity media conveyor belt.Ant and Dec are the innocent face of this celebrity supply machine. They are boyish and good natured, they put participants at ease and guide them through tantrums and disappointments. They have an unusually benign rapport with each other – most showbusiness couples have more edge. Away from the shows, their lives have, until now, been relatively blameless: they don’t behave badly they take their mothers to the Palace for their gongs and, phew, they have even married women just when the tabloids were beginning to wonder. Their brand of wholesomeness, playful entertainment and sympathetic rapport with participants is massively important for ITV. By appearing decent and deserving themselves, they make this kind of entertainment, even through its low points, seem acceptable: a quest for innocent celebrity fun.In some respects, Ant and Dec really are deserving. They have certainly worked hard. Ant was brought up by a single mother in Newcastle, and first came to fame as a child actor in the TV series Byker Grove, which is where he met Declan Donnelly. They became friends and after a brief detour into pop, found TV presenting. They’ve lived their lives in the spotlight ever since. And while they now earn fabulous amounts, as the Mail was quick to remind us, their work is far from glamorous. They deal with the unedifying process of celebrity making and breaking from the inside.On Britain’s Got Talent this means dealing with the casting of suitable subjects, and all the artificialities behind the scenes. On I’m a Celebrity, they hang around in sordid conditions outside a fake jungle, holding at bay teams from countries waiting to take over the set, and witnessing endless negotiations with the celebs.This may be enough to drive anyone to drink or to something worse, which itself provides new script lines for a macabre and interactive public soap opera.It’s more than just a powerful irony that McPartlin’s downfall played out this week in the media’s full glare. His clean personality has helped to mask the darker process of celebrification, and made the goal of fame seem unproblematic. His cheerfulness has hidden the downside of fame, the envious hostility it awakens. So perhaps it’s also poetic justice he finds himself mocked by a media that cares little for his distress. There’s an obligatory sequel to the celebrity narrative of “Build them up and knock them down”, an episode called “Let’s see if they can get up again”.McPartlin’s tortured appearance suggests he knows the arc as well as the public. But what does our appetite for this recurring drama say about us? We could look away now and not allow ourselves to get caught up in the process of another human unravelling. Once we might have done so. At least we might have seemed reluctant to be part of the cavalcade. Now we are integral to it.

Only some level of regulation will doBut the challenge we now face has one key difference to that posed by the oil barons. Rather than price-fixing, many of the tech titans provide a largely “free” service to the public. Facebook and Google don’t make most of their money through selling services to users, but through advertising. Amazon and Apple, meanwhile, do make money the traditional way, but corner their markets through other means, by squeezing suppliers in the former case or locking in users through software and hardware exclusivity in the latter. So why do these new monopolies pose a problem?Firstly, because they hold back innovation. By acquiring potential challengers before they become a threat, spending millions lobbying governments to ensure their economic interests are protected, and tying in users through the sheer scale of features and social interaction they offer, the tech giants’ dominant position often leaves entrepreneurs feeling they have no choice but to sell up, or close up. This is bad for innovation and bad for consumer choice – two things the tech giants once stood for.In addition, the tech titans have lost the ability to monitor what content gets put on their own platforms. A small minority of users are posting terrorist propaganda, depictions of child sex abuse, and hate speech. State and non-state actors use these platforms to spread false information and influence elections, including the Brexit referendum and the recent US presidential election. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are either unable or unwilling to curb the misuse of the data they collect, and are increasingly seen as part of the problem.Finally, the new internet giants operate in a largely borderless world where their main source of profit is intangible intellectual property rather than measurable “things”. This is difficult to track and quantify, and has turned national tax authorities into largely powerless bystanders.Of course, any new technology is open to abuse, and the internet has also been an outstanding force for good in its short history. It has empowered activists and investigative journalists in fighting for democracy and exposing corruption, and amplified important campaigns like the #MeToo movement and recent anti-gun marches in the United States.But we stand at a crossroads. One way leads to monopoly and abuse. The other way continues the road to empowerment and liberation.How should we respond? As liberals we must show that to be radical in this field is not to be statist. We do not accept a Hobson’s choice between the entrenched private monopolies which are becoming the status quo, or direct state control over the internet, as is being developed in China. First, we must revive the trust-busting spirit of previous generations. Competition authorities should be primarily concerned with takeovers which stifle innovation or involve the acquisition of large quantities of valuable data. More radically, companies should be broken up when their size becomes economically detrimental.One could imagine Amazon being split into three separate businesses: one offering cloud computing, one acting as a general retailer and one offering a third-party marketplace. Facebook could be made to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, Google could est itself of YouTube – in the process creating new competitors for themselves.Second, internet companies should be held accountable for extreme content posted on their platforms through the establishment of a new independent standards body governing the handling of such content. This would put an end to the current “wild west” approach of self-regulation and haphazard government responses to tech-company failures. This is preferable to the draconian system recently put in place by Germany, which has already led to excessive censorship by private companies and a backlog of court appeals and disputes.Third, concerns over the manipulation of data can be met in part through greater transparency, requiring search algorithms to be made available to the authorities and by requiring commercially used databases to be available for a variety of uses. Such principles become even more important as the data giants develop the use of AI, where there is even more potential for monopoly abuse and manipulation.Finally, we must entrench and expand the rights of people to own their personal data. The EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation is a big step forward in this direction, but it clearly needs to be tested in practice. And it is just the beginning, not the end of the story. We should seriously consider the possibility of compensating people – or society more broadly – financially for the data they currently hand over for nothing.All four of these suggestions require Britain to be a truly global nation, leading these debates rather than following on the coat-tails of others. The UK cannot do this alone. It will require a regulatory authority with far more clout. How tragic then, that the most effective competition authority in the capitalist world – one that has already fined Google €2.4bn for market abuse – is the European commission. As the world grows closer together, Britain commits an act of serious self-harm by doggedly setting itself apart from the power of shared sovereignty with our neighbours.When it comes to regulating the new oil – data – Brexit is the equivalent of giving up shared influence over where, when and whether it rains, in return for absolute power over a compact umbrella.• Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dfed3184b10606e5797d883c5d9f5e7ced015fc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=76dff2ba1fd01ee42d0a38bd19dd4c6f 1720w","title":"theresa may windrush equality","story":"One of the most tragic aspects of writing about gun deaths in America is hearing black parents make the case for why their child should not have been killed. They will impress on you that their children were not gang members, even when you don’t ask. They will make sure you know their kids had never been in trouble with the police, even when it is not relevant. In short they want to make it clear their child was a casualty worthy of your grief and empathy.There are good reasons for this. Parents want to preserve a cherished memory of their child, and by emphasising good character they accentuate the obscenity of the tragedy. But the primary motivation is to counter the assumption that black youth are feral, lethal and essentially criminal, and if they were shot it’s probably because they deserved it.For each family this makes sense and can hardly be criticised. But collectively it lends credence to the notion that there are children getting shot who are unworthy of our grief and empathy: the tragedy becomes not that a kid has been shot but that the wrong kind of kid has been shot.As the British government implodes over the treatment of the Windrush generation we must ensure that the rightful outrage about the exclusion of those who are now, finally, perceived as “worthy immigrants” does not blind us to the outrageous immigration policies that made such exclusion possible and will continue to exclude others deemed “unworthy”.Theresa May is not apologising for creating a “hostile environment”, expressly designed to spread fear in immigrant communities, when she was home secretary. She is simply conceding that the Home Office has been hostile to the wrong people. The apology, as it stands, is not for the existence of a policy that is unfair, unjust and discriminatory and causes anxiety, penury and despair, but for the ostensible misapplication of it. Over the past week, the official regrets have been too narrowly tailored, the memories too selective, the mendacity too brazen and the callousness too pernicious to see the government’s parsed and partial expressions of remorse as anything other than an insult to our intelligence.The government has accepted it has made mistakes. The trouble is that it has confessed to the wrong ones. Depriving British citizens of their jobs, healthcare, benefits, pensions, housing and liberty, if they could not provide up to four pieces of documentary evidence for every year they have been here stretching back over 50 years, is not the result of an administrative error. If it had been, it could have been corrected five months ago, when the Guardian broke the first story relating to this scandal. Back in 2014, May did not set out to create a “rigorous” or “stringent” environment, but a “hostile” one in which all migrants would be considered illegal unless they could prove otherwise, and Britain would adopt a “deport first, appeal later” ethos. This is what it looks like.They were warned. On 30 January 2014 Diane Abbott asked May whether she had considered “the effect that her measures that are designed to crack down on illegal immigrants could have on people who are British nationals, but appear as if they might be immigrants?” They knew they were doing wrong. Virtually every time my colleague Amelia Gentleman wrote about a person’s case, the Home Office would contact their lawyers within a day – sometimes within an hour – of the article going online to say the problem had been resolved.Last month, when alerted to the case of Albert Thompson, who was denied cancer treatment unless he paid £54,000, even though he’d lived in Britain for 44 years, May said she sympathised but would not intervene because he needed to “evidence his settled status” in the UK. As recently as last week, Downing Street said she would not meet Caribbean heads of state, in London for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, to discuss the issue.The mistake the government made was assuming the woes of a few elderly black people born in the Caribbean could not prick the nation’s conscience. They underestimated the pull the Windrush generation could have on Britons’ sense of self. This was not an irrational calculation. When the 2014 Immigration Act that enshrined the “hostile environment” policy was passed, Ukip was riding high in the polls and immigration was the nation’s principal concern. Labour backed the act and only 18 MPs (including Jeremy Corbyn, David Lammy, John McDonnell and Abbott) voted against it. So long as they were talking about “illegal immigrants” and not human beings, that consensus held.But there is, it turns out, a positive story we can tell ourselves about race and immigration. In the week of the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech, we have been celebrating the contributions of black foreigners. We have heard about taxes they have paid, the communities they have built, the families they have grown and the way they have changed Britain for the better. We have been talking about immigrants as though they have humanity and about immigration as though it could benefit us.What is true of immigrants who arrived 70 years ago is true of immigrants today. The fact that these people are being celebrated today is not a product of Britain’s innate sense of fair play. The Windrush generation is far more popular now than it was just after the Windrush docked, when white youths would go “nigger hunting” and signs declared that black people were not welcome in pubs and hostels.And what is true of racists 70 years ago is true of racists and xenophobes today. Over the past week this ageing cohort has been elevated to the status of national treasure. This has been made possible partly through nostalgia and partly through the affection of the communities in which they have long been embedded, but not least through the constant struggle that continues to be waged for equality.So long as the government has a policy of hostility towards immigrants, that struggle continues. These laws are not bad because they ensnared the Windrush generation this just clarified the obscenity and amplified the bigotry on which they were based. They\u0026nbspare bad laws because they are designed to turn every Briton – doctor, landlord or teacher – into a border guard, and every migrant, whether they have a\u0026nbspright to be here or not, into a suspect. Britain owes the\u0026nbspWindrush generation a debt of gratitude. The best way to repay them, after securing the citizenship of all\u0026nbspwho are entitled to it, is by learning the lessons of the\u0026nbsppast 70 years rather than repeating the mistakes.• Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian.

Why has it taken so long?Did she just say … Kendrick Lamar? The satisfied little smile on Pulitzer prize administrator Dana Canedy’s face as she announced the final award of the afternoon confirmed what I thought I surely had misheard. In awarding the first Pulitzer for a hip-hop album and artist, the music jury, which included the jazz violinist Regina Carter and Columbia professor Farah Jasmine Griffin, cited Lamar’s “vernacular authenticity” and “affecting vignettes … on African-American life”. In other words, the boy can rap.It has been an abundant week for black excellence: Black Panther was certified the third highest-grossing film in US box-office history Beyoncé delivered a jaw-dropping performance at Coachella and yes, Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer prize. We seem to be having a moment. But is it a moment of increased creativity, or just increased recognition for what we’ve been doing all along?The surprise of Lamar’s win comes, in part, from the fact that the Pulitzers don’t announce finalists ahead of time. But there’s also, obviously, another element: no one expects a young black rapper to win one of the fanciest prizes in the land. Despite the fact that black Americans have long been at the vanguard of popular music and culture – evidenced, in part, by hip-hop overtaking rock this year to officially become the top-selling musical genre – there is still a gaping chasm between black artists’ creative achievements and how that work is acknowledged by the white mainstream.Beyoncé’s riveting performance at Coachella last weekend is just one example. With her all-black marching band and string section, Formation-infused rendition of James Weldon Johnson’s “black national anthem” Lift Every Voice and Sing, and tireless vocals and choreography, she gave us a loving salute to historically black college culture that was not only artistically impressive, but a technical feat, with abundant pyrotechnics, a giant bleacher-style set, dozens of musicians and dancers in constant, meticulous motion, and top-level live video editing that is tough to get in a single take.But she was also the first woman of colour to headline the festival in its 20-year history. She is the most beloved artist on the face of the planet, but had to watch Adele, a huge Beyoncé fan, reluctantly accept the 2017 Grammy for Album of the Year over her. In previous years, Beyoncé lost that award to Beck and to Taylor Swift.There’s a reason Kanye West ran up to a different award stage, at the Video Music awards in 2009, to snatch the microphone from Taylor Swift to deem Beyoncé’s Single Ladies “one of the best videos of all time”– because mainstream institutions rarely give black artists their due. You can hold your breath waiting on that recognition or you can take matters – and mics – into your own hands.This reality harks back to what so many black children are taught by our parents: that we have to “work twice as hard to earn half as much”. That to succeed, compromises and considerations have to be made. Tina Knowles, in hearing her daughter’s idea for a Coachella show with an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities) theme for a mostly white audience, thought perhaps it would go over their heads. (And it did.) Beyoncé’s response? “At this point in my life and my career, I have a responsibility to do what’s best for the world and not what is most popular.”If you know you might not ever get a top award for your work, perhaps that allows you the creative licence to do whatever you want. For Beyoncé, whose racial politics did not discernibly enter her work until Lemonade (2016), that has meant celebrating the Black Panthers at the Super Bowl and talking about police brutality in the Formation video. At Coachella, it meant creating her own sorority, “Beta Delta Kappa”, complete with step show and an initiation – for a “historically Beyoncé college or university”. As someone who attended an HBCU, it felt so good, so special, to be directly spoken to like that. Beyoncé said she hoped young people of all races would feel inspired to further research the references made in her performance. But she didn’t make that beautiful performance for everybody. She made it for us.The same goes for Lamar and Damn. It’s an album that is explicitly political, openly black and undeniably good. His Pulitzer resonates, in part, because it’s a deviation from the norm of overlooking black artists for their unparalleled contributions to culture.It is also a major institution’s belated acknowledgment of a genre that has been award-worthy for decades. For the Pulitzers, Grammys and others, the first person of colour to do something often happens long after the founding of the organisation. Though it’s exciting to see Lamar, Beyoncé, Ava DuVernay, Tiffany Haddish and Donald Glover be so publicly lauded, it does raise the question: why did it take so long?Every year that black people and other marginalised groups get shut out from big awards (which could be every year), there are two reactions: the demand for inclusion, and the demand to “create our own awards”. There are those who seek the legitimising kiss of an Academy and there are those who know it’s not by us, or for us.The Pulitzer board’s “special citations”, which are only occasionally given, illustrate a telling pattern: Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk were only honoured long after their deaths Alex Haley was cited for Roots in 1977 when he just as easily could have won for The Autobiography of Malcolm X. It reminds me of Spike Lee’s “special” Oscar awarded in 2015 it smacks of a consolation prize.With someone as culturally invested as Lamar, it’s important to remember that a Pulitzer does not legitimate him, his work, or his art form. Though it be middle-aged, with a Harvard archive and research institute specialising in it, hip-hop has never needed formal recognition of its merits.And for black artists, who so often get passed over for recognition, many times in favour of non-black artists doing approximately the same thing (see: Macklemore beating Lamar for best rap album at the 2014 Grammys), that distinction – a guest at the table, or seated at the head – might mean the difference between the freedom to create, and the hope that one day, that kiss will be for you.It’s wonderful to see them celebrated and deified but Kendrick, Beyoncé, Lena Waithe, Jordan Peele, Cardi B, and so many more were creating works we love long before the establishment paid attention. In other words, if a black artist does her work in the woods and the white mainstream isn’t there to see it, doesn’t she still slay?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca832f03a51c111bde8df0b8cf9a59fb84aee9b0/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=2500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6580073c8dfc4c88803a3b33f71b4ae1 5000w","title":"its covered the best spring coats and jackets for all ages in pictures","story":"It might be warm now but come evening, the temperatures always drop.

Stars including Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Greta Gerwig all said they would never work with him again.“I am very shocked by this sudden treatment,” Bardem said. “Judgments in the states of New York and Connecticut found him innocent. The legal situation today is the same as in 2007.” In fact no charges were filed after Farrow accused him of molesting her when she was a child, something that Allen denies. Despite a state’s attorney saying he had “probable cause” to prosecute, Allen was never put on trial, a move intended to spare Dylan Farrow the trauma of a court appearance, the prosecutor said.An op-ed from Dylan Farrow in December, criticizing the hypocrisy of actors for keeping quiet over the alleged abuse from her father, led to more speaking out. “I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: if I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film,” Gerwig said in a roundtable discussion for the New York Times. “I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.”Allen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, is still awaiting release. Two of its stars, Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet, have already donated their salaries to charity. “I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all the people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve,” wrote Chalamet in an Instagram post.Bardem’s response arrives after Alec Baldwin also made his defense of the director clear. “Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed,” Baldwin tweeted. “The renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it’s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.”Diane Keaton has also continued to support the film-maker. “Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,” she tweeted in January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d86c44cf0102709e250561497cc903d77f65a45b/48_0_872_523/master/872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=34ca3cc650998074978117ddad5732b8 1240w","title":"beyond the clouds review bollywood majid majidi","story":"A motorbike drug-runner and his sister face a storm of trouble in this uneven drama by the feted Iranian director Majid MajidiMajid Majidi is the Iranian director who established himself most satisfyingly with the 1997 gem Children of Heaven, a very charming and sweet-natured tale about two children, a brother and sister. His latest movie is a departure: a slightly misfiring Hindi-language Bollywood-style melodrama set in the Mumbai underworld, with a forthright musical soundtrack from veteran composer AR Rahman. It, too, is about a brother and sister, but they are older and more disillusioned.Amir (Ishaan Khattar) is a kid working for a sinister gang boss and sex-trafficker, couriering drugs around town on his motorbike under cover of making fast-food deliveries. On one occasion he is chased by cops and desperately implores his sister Tara (Malavika Mohanan) to hide him and the wrap of coke he has on him. Akshi (played by the actor and director Goutam Ghose), an acquaintance of Tara’s at the market where she works, bundles Amir into a pile of his clothes as the cops come through. Later, Akshi makes violent sexual demands on Tara in return for having helped, and she hits out at him. Soon Akshi is in hospital and Tara is in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder. If Akshi dies things will go badly for her. The parallel lives of brother and sister thus play out on the ironically wrong tracks, with the career petty criminal outside jail, and innocent Tara befriending a small child in prison. Then Amir somehow becomes involved with Akshi’s extended family, having posed as his friend to gain access to his bedside to make threats. The film ends on an interestingly unstressed note, with untied plot threads and an emphasis on the imagery of the title. But until then, it is brash Bollywood stuff, and I’m not certain the very dark and grimly realistic elements are entirely absorbed into the unrealistic sentimental style of the film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60a10183da5cde239970e1f27e48d37f75cce910/0_70_1505_903/master/1505.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=11b5b189422c12f2103f9418720070ff 1240w","title":"panned on release hopelessly devoted to grease 40 years later","story":"An endorsement of rape culture or a rejection of slut-shaming: the debate over the film continues, four decades on. How did it become arguably the most beloved movie musical of all time?• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayWhen Grease was released in cinemas in 1978, a starry, bubblegum-bright adaptation of the 1971 Chicago-to-Broadway musical, the initial reviews were not kind. “A grave disappointment to anyone in search of style or substance,” wrote the Guardian’s Derek Malcolm that year – although, like many of his similarly unimpressed critical peers, he did concede that it was fun and likely to be a big hit. Such an assessment turned out to be as understated as Sandy’s pre-makeover twinset-and-pearls. According to Box Office Mojo, Grease is the second-most-successful musical movie ever, beaten only in the past 12 months by Disney’s mammoth Beauty and the Beast live-action reboot.The Randal Kleiser-directed plot is as old as time: boy meets girl, boy loses girl by being an idiot in front of his friends, girl gets sewn into a skintight catsuit to win him back, stud. It’s easy to see why the film’s winning formula of gaudy 50s nostalgia, killer songs and unforgettable performances has had such an enduring afterlife. Despite the fact that the majority of the cast were “old enough to be their own parents”, as the New York Times’s Vincent Canby noted wryly in 1978 – at 23, John Travolta was one of the younger actors, and far closer to being a teenager than Stockard Channing, who was 33 when she played Rizzo – its story of fast cars, hot rollers and summer lovin’ is now written in the yearbook of movie history in permanent marker.“We’ve just had The Greatest Showman and La La Land, but before that we hadn’t had an original musical in 20 years,” says Terri White, a Grease fan and editor-in-chief of the movie magazine Empire. “The musical had never really been cool and the fact that Grease is a musical is a big barrier for some people.”She puts its early critical reception down to a snobbery that still persists among some film buffs. “They see it as inferior. If you think about the age we’re in now, a lot of films arguably go for a more male audience, especially the big blockbuster movies. But what I love about Grease is that it has huge mass appeal and, also, an unashamedly female appeal.”White points out that Grease is a mix of the musical, romcom and teen-movie genres that traditionally appeal to female audiences. It also offers a readily relatable ensemble of characters who aren’t just minor twists on the usual archetypes. There’s one character in particular, though, who provides the beating heart of the movie, and it isn’t Danny or Sandy. Louisa Lytton starred in the revival of the stage version of Grease, which toured the UK for much of 2017. “They asked me originally if I wanted to go in and sing for Sandy and I thought, I kind of always play that girl-next-door role,” she recalls. “I thought, I’d really like to go for Rizzo. Growing up watching the film, she’s most people’s favourite character and, in my mind she has the best song.”Channing’s turn as the unapologetic bad girl Rizzo, who rules the Pink Ladies with pithy one-liners and withering looks, and shimmies down drainpipes late at night to get her kicks, is a true scene-stealer and. As Lytton says, she’s a firm fan favourite. There Are Worst Things I Could Do comes towards the end of the film, as Rizzo experiences a pregnancy scare following a backseat fumble with Kenickie. It almost didn’t make the final cut – Channing was forced to plead with producers to keep it in – but it’s a remarkable, emotionally complex and surprisingly contemporary song that rejects “slut-shaming” long before it had a name. In today’s climate, rewatching the classics with an eye on gender politics can be an unsettling experience, unseating old favourites, and Grease is at the heart of a raging debate as to whether the film is sexist, or feminist, with a surprising amount of fervour in each corner.Some take the Summer Nights’ line “Did she put up a fight?” as an endorsement of date rape, while Danny’s clumsy insistence on feeling up Sandy during the drive-in is a questionable scene (there’s also a small and disturbing aside from Marty, who mentions that she caught the much older TV host Vince Fontaine “putting aspirin into my Coke” after the dance). Some argue that Rizzo pays the price for her promiscuity (even Danny calls her “sloppy seconds”, although ultimately she gets away scot-free and is allowed to be happy) and that Sandy is forced to change from “too pure to be Pink” into a smokin’ (and smoking) bad girl to live up to Danny’s expectations, while he does little to demonstrate that he has earned her affections back, aside from putting on a cardigan, which he quickly whips off again.Dr Barbara Jane Brickman is an assistant professor of media and gender studies at the University of Alabama. Last year, she published a book about the film called Grease: Gender, Nostalgia and Youth Consumption in the Blockbuster Era. “Coming towards the end of the swinging 1970s but supposedly lacking any condemnation of the 1950s era, Grease was criticised for being a reactionary piece of (white) male fantasy, one longing for a time when boys could be boys, women knew their place, and there was no racial conflict (or ersity, for that matter),” she explains. Yet she feels this assessment does the film a disservice. “The film is, through much of its action, a girl’s film – exploring girls’ ‘bedroom culture’ and fandom, wrestling with and critiquing that sexual double standard impinging itself on Rizzo and Sandy, and focusing on female teen friendships, more so, one might argue, than many, many teen films then or since.”The song Greased Lightnin’, then, is not an endorsement of macho posturing, but a criticism of it, poking fun at the silliness of the T-Birds’ hollow posing. After all, nobody really thinks Danny is cool when he first sees Sandy at Rydell, having thought her lost to Australia, then he blows it immediately by showing off in front of his friends, “rockin’ and rollin’ and whatnot”, as he blusters. Towards the end of the film, when Kenickie asks Danny to be his wingman at Thunder Road, they share a sweet and exposing moment, first punching each other, then pulling in for a hug, then, embarrassed, pretending it never happened, slicking their quiffs instead. Even Kenickie’s inexperience shows the fragility of the gang’s ego and image.I had not realised that Kenickie was supposed to be a virgin, nor that Rizzo was probably lying about him not being the potential father to spare his feelings, until many viewings into my adult years. Most Grease fans can remember a point at which they twigged that the upbeat songs they had been singing throughout their childhood contained some pretty risqué lyrics about being a horny teenager, and it stopped seeming quite so innocent. When the US channel Fox aired a Coca-Cola sponsored Grease Live! production on TV in early 2016, it dampened several of the lyrics, with Greased Lightnin’, in particular, getting the clean-up treatment – “pussy wagon” became “dream wagon”, while “the chicks’ll cream” became “the chicks’ll scream”. Nevertheless, Grease remains an oddly family-friendly favourite. “It is a film that appeals to different generations,” agrees Lytton. “Adults can watch it and enjoy that side of it, and kids can enjoy the songs, but there’s something in it for everyone, hence why it’s always on at Christmas.”To mark its 40th anniversary, Grease is being rereleased on the big screen, with some cinemas hosting singalong screenings. Even without the excuse of a birthday, Grease is never really far away – it’s a staple of the few UK drive-in cinema experiences, naturally, and when the immersive film experience Secret Cinema put on Grease in 2012, recreating the end-of-year summer fete, the event was a sellout. “To people who love Grease, it’s more than just a film. It reminds them of when they first watched it, it reminds them of what it meant to them when they were a kid, what it taught them about being in love, what it taught them about teenage rebellion,” says White. “I think it stays with you throughout your whole life.” Rydell for ever. Bon voyage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8339a666bdeec2d8eb65868d0ae33335e2e7f40f/255_59_1678_1006/master/1678.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b24acfbf83f6083d457ff80d1b051cbe 1240w","title":"liverpool success coutinho klopp genius","story":"I have heard Jürgen Klopp cite inspirations as varied as heavy metal music and Rocky Balboa so\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspwouldn’t be surprised if the Liverpool manager\u0026nbspwas also familiar with Aristotle. After all, Klopp showed in January that his football philosophy is very much in line with the great Greek thinker who believed that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.Klopp shocked many in the football world when almost four months ago he sanctioned the sale of his most technically gifted player, Philippe Coutinho, who had been outstanding in the first half of the season and did not replace him like for like, causing supporters and pundits to question everything from his judgment to his sanity. Instead he recruited a centre-back in Virgil van Dijk and trusted his instinct that the team would improve as a consequence.If you reflect on some of the commentary and analysis\u0026nbspof Liverpool at the end of the January transfer window you would assume that their performances would tail off without the genius and creativity of Coutinho and that they could not possibly withstand the loss of a world-class player.Instead fast forward to mid‑April and I cannot remember a time when Liverpool have been in such a strong position and fans so hopeful in the short and long term to fight for the top trophies at home and in Europe.The narrative which Klopp has superbly orchestrated is a story about the victory of team functionality, philosophy and identity where the importance of team chemistry, understanding of inidual roles within a system and collectivism is evident. This is vital in a sport where increasingly more importance is placed on the inidual superstar and the size of transfer fees and wages that come with that kind of player.What Liverpool have achieved this season, especially since Coutinho moved to Barcelona and they acquired Van\u0026nbspDijk, should be lauded and studied by fans, pundits and aspiring coaches such as me in understanding that success can be built even while losing top inidual attacking players if you have a fundamental style of play that enables a team to outweigh the sum of its parts and produce not just winning football but get supporters of all allegiances off their seats every time they play.Klopp has shown that you can improve a side while selling your best player if you cater to the needs of your most productive players in the way that you play and it is no coincidence that the signing of Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain has tactically enabled the likes of Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino and the outstanding Mo\u0026nbspSalah to be even more of a threat.Oxlade-Chamberlain, while a gifted footballer, does not have the technical ability of Coutinho but what he does bring is an athletic dynamism and power that Coutinho doesn’t possess and an extreme intensity which creates a platform for Liverpool’s lightning transitions where the likes of Mané and Salah cause havoc. It was evident in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City where in that first half their pressing, counterpressing and attacking transitions were incredible and I question whether, if Coutinho had been playing instead of Oxlade-Chamberlain, Liverpool would have been quite as dynamic, intense and productive.Also, in addressing their need for a top centre-half Liverpool now possess an added defensive steel, giving their outstanding front three the opportunity and foundation to score and create goals. I also look at the fundamental way Klopp sets out his teams and the way that iniduals within his system have improved because they know what is expected of them.Andrew Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mané,\u0026nbspSalah, Firmino and even a veteran in James\u0026nbspMilner\u0026nbspare raising their game week after week and have\u0026nbspplayed an integral part in implementing the principles of Klopp’s coaching while justifying the faith he places not on reputation or transfer fee but the performances of those he trusts.It all comes down to team functionality and forward planning, and this can be achieved only with a top manager who understands and is faithful to his style of play regardless of the inevitable criticism he faces when times get tough. Pep Guardiola and Klopp have been criticised in this country for sticking to their football principles when results have not been up to scratch but this comes with the territory and is understandable, while the bigger picture shows that recruitment and improving the players on an inidual level increases their monetary value and gives the football club a vision and plan for the longer term.Selling Coutinho for almost £150m is a great example of this. He has been replaced in the team by a relatively young player in Oxlade-Chamberlain, who possesses a completely different football profile but fits perfectly into the team’s philosophy at a fraction of the price and has improved the team’s functionality and chemistry overall.This is managerial genius and it not only keeps the fans happy but also the directors and shareholders who are always checking the club spreadsheets!This Liverpool journey has only just begun and I am excited to see where it ends both this season and in years to come – but it is also a story of how we need to see the whole picture, as fans, coaches and in the media, that matches are rarely won by one superstar but by the collaboration and collectivism of 11 players committed to the functionality of the team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f32b11344125cafb50ef70fe8541d73bc91cf36e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ecf17c6e9261f0cee2cf603deb1a7bc 1240w","title":"premier league and fa cup semis what to look out for this weekend","story":"Jonjo Shelvey looks to impress Gareth Southgate, another safety net for Watford, and what is left for Manchester City?If José Mourinho’s inclusion of Paul Pogba in a much-changed starting XI at Bournemouth was designed to test his midfielder then the reaction on all sides would suggest he passed. Pogba’s all-round display was fine, no more and no less, but his second-half assist for Romelu Lukaku was something to remember it by and his manager professed himself satisfied with a “top performance”. It is never a good idea to second-guess Mourinho but the smart money is on Pogba being given a chance to discover some elusive consistency at Wembley. United’s need is urgent: in effect their whole season comes down to how they handle a Tottenham side that looked a touch off the pace against Brighton in midweek, and these are the occasions their most expensive signings were bought to deliver in. Pogba did it once at the Etihad two weeks ago a showing of match-winning influence on Saturday might suggest Mourinho should not lose patience just yet. Nick Ames• Five-star City dominate PFA Premier League team of the year• City avoid transfer ban over signing of teenager GarréFor nearly an hour of their first start together for Chelsea, against Burnley on Thursday, Olivier Giroud and Álvaro Morata performed in a way that might have got Antonio Conte thinking about deploying two strikers from the start of Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Southampton. They combined well with each other and regularly tore open a Burnley defence that has been one of the tightest in the Premier League this season. But then Morata wasted a clear chance to wrap up victory for Chelsea. Soon after that he was taken off and his anger was visible as he watched the remainder of the game from the bench, evidently knowing he had blown his chance in more ways that one. Conte is unlikely to rejig his preferred formation for the semi-final and will probably entrust the role of lone striker to Giroud, who will be confident of adding to the two goals he scored against Southampton after replacing Morata in last Saturday’s match at St Mary’s. Emerson Palmeiri, meanwhile, did well enough against Burnley to suggest that he, unlike the suspended Marcos Alonso, might be able to tolerate Shane Long’s pestering without resorting to sly kicks from behind. Paul DoyleThey couldn’t … could they? Almost certainly not, goes the answer, and the likelihood is West Brom will end up lamenting that any upturn in form brought about by Sunday’s seismic win at Old Trafford came around just too late. This weekend could seal their relegation but the alternative for a side rejuvenated by the popular Darren Moore is that a glimmer of cruel hope persists. One would expect Liverpool to extinguish it but this might be the best possible time to host Jurgen Klopp’s side. Tuesday’s Champions League semi-final first leg at Anfield looms large and, while Klopp will probably stop short of wholesale changes, an eye on the challenge ahead might be excused. If West Brom can come out roaring then the kind of result they used to pull off before things went sour under Tony Pulis is not beyond them – in which case, who could begrudge a few thousand dreams, however brief, of the greatest Premier League escape story ever told? NAOn the face of it, this match between the teams currently ninth seems of little consequence. Perhaps this is why in the buildup as much attention has been lavished upon one man who will be sitting in the stands as on the 22 likely to line up on the pitch. Gareth Southgate is expected to be at Goodison Park for the purposes of appraising Jonjo Shelvey, who has been in superb form for Newcastle over the last few months. Southgate has already auditioned a long list of central midfielders, giving single caps to Jack Cork, James Ward-Prowse, Lewis Cook and Harry Winks, two to Ruben Loftus-Cheek. The surprise is that he has taken so long to turn to Shelvey, who since being shown two yellow cards in a single game in December (against Everton, as it happens) has a spotless disciplinary record, and has experienced league defeat only against Manchester City (twice). But this is not the first time this season that Southgate has watched Newcastle, and nothing he saw in October’s 1-0 win over Crystal Palace convinced him to call up either Shelvey or Jamaal Lascelles, who declared himself “disappointed” to be overlooked. “I’d love to go to the World Cup,” Shelvey said last week. “But there’s only so much I can do to get into that squad, and then it’s down to the manager to select you.” A stellar performance on Monday would certainly help. SB• Shelvey could bring World Cup pizzazz to England’s beige midfield• England winning the World Cup would take ‘a miracle’, says WalkerArsenal’s sixth home game in as many weeks smacks, like a number of those before it, of box-ticking when the defining moment in their season lies elsewhere. Not even the prospect of a derby will fill all the red gaps inside the Emirates, although the picture will look rather different when Atlético Madrid visit next Thursday. For Arsène Wenger’s side this counts as an audition the problem is that nobody stated their case for Europa League semi-final inclusion during last weekend’s flat defeat at Newcastle and Wenger will probably opt to field a number of players who have little chance of starting against Atlético. One of the few remaining points of contention lies in goal: Wenger gave the European gig to Petr Cech once things became serious on that front, starting his No1 in both matches against CSKA Moscow, but the 35-year-old was at fault for the Russian side’s second goal at the VEB Arena and there is no escaping that his errors have cost Arsenal league points this season too. Whoever faces the Hammers will probably not play on Thursday but, should that be Ospina, could a strong showing yet change his manager’s mind? NAIn their last three games, as well as conceding two goals in three second-half minutes to turn a lead over Burnley into defeat, Watford have let in a stoppage-time equaliser for Bournemouth and a stoppage-time winner for Huddersfield. After scoring three result-twisting last-minute goals in successive games in September and October Watford have developed a depressing habit of letting them in, a fact that Crystal Palace are certainly aware of: at Selhurst Park in December Watford managed to hold the lead for 86 minutes and still lose, conceding in the 89th minute and again in stoppage time. Only Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City have scored as many goals in the last 10 minutes of matches as Watford, but nobody is even close to matching the number of goals they concede as matches near their conclusion. They are currently combining a habit of ending matches badly with one of ending seasons badly, with depressing results, but if they are to reach 40 points this season this appears the best chance of them doing so. SB• Those who call me a er are jumping on the bandwagon, says Zaha• Last-gasp tap-in gives Huddersfield crucial win over WatfordStoke’s last three matches are potentially seismic duels with Swansea and Crystal Palace, plus a trip to Liverpool, who may be distracted by the Champions League. But to sustain belief that they can approach that run-in with a reasonable chance of scrambling out of the relegation zone, Stoke badly need to beat Burnley on Sunday. Little about their season so far suggests they have the firepower to infiltrate one of the meanest defences in the league. Their chief source of danger could turn out to be Moritz Bauer, the right-back who has impressed since arriving in January and has the ability to pose Burnley the sort of problems that Victor Moses caused them on Thursday. Stoke are in trouble partly because they have made some woefully misjudged purchases in the last couple of years but the Austrian seems a shrewd acquisition.

Like the final days of his illustrious career, however, it did not quite go exactly to plan. “I actually joined in for a bit of five-a-side,” he says. “It was OK – the kids were happy because I lost twice but maybe tomorrow we can get some revenge.”The South African, who made more than 200 appearances for Everton in two spells, was back on Merseyside in his new role as club ambassador to take part in a weekly coaching session for refugees and asylum seekers. Part of Everton in the Community’s efforts to provide support for some of Liverpool’s most deprived people, Pienaar knows all about battling against the odds.Born in the township of Westbury in Johannesburg during the apartheid years, the 36-year-old’s career took him to Ajax as a teenager and also encompassed spells with Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham and Sunderland.Now, with a record number of 60 clubs from across the country set to take part in Amnesty UK’s second Football Welcomes initiative this weekend after the success of last year’s inaugural event, Pienaar is hoping schemes like Everton’s can continue to improve the assimilation\u0026nbspprocess.“We are working with kids from different parts of the world and trying to give them an opportunity to learn English,” he says. “Football is a special sport which brings people together – whatever problems you are having in your life they all seem to go away when you get on to the pitch. I was born in apartheid South Africa and I know how sport, including football, can help to bring people together and break down barriers. I’ve been in that situation and I’ve always wanted to get involved with the community.”Started in 2015, it is estimated 140 young people from 25 countries including Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia have already benefited from Everton’s community project. Similar initiatives such as Middlesbrough’s Club Together scheme have sprung up around the country as Britain’s football clubs attempt to help ease the transition to a new country.On Saturday, 12 Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Everton, Tottenham, Crystal Palace and West Ham will be among those showing their support and solidarity with refugees through a variety of activities and events.“It’s wonderful to see even more clubs laying aside their rivalries this weekend and coming together to say refugees are welcome here,” says Naomi Westland, Amnesty UK’s Football Welcomes manager. “At a time when politics is often dominated by hate-filled and isive rhetoric, this shows that there is another story to be told. Football clubs are at the heart of their communities and have a vital role to play in helping people who have fled conflict and persecution settle in to a new country and culture.”Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka, Victor Moses of Chelsea, Stoke’s Xherdan Shaqiri and Manchester City women’s striker Nadia Nadim are among a number of players currently employed by English clubs who were once refugees. They are following in the footsteps of six children who escaped the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s who became professionals, including Norwich’s Antonio and José Gallego. More than 80 years on, the Championship club is hosting Norfolk Welcomes – Football Welcomes, with children from 61 local schools sending questions to the club’s Bosnia and Herzegovina international Mario Vrancic, whose family escaped the Balkan war in the 1990s. “It was clear the war in Bosnia was coming and we had to leave to find safety,” he recalled this week. “My entire family went to different countries. The hardest thing was leaving my grandparents behind and trying to start a new life in a new country.”A number of other initiatives down the football pyramid will also be taking place, including tournaments run by refugee teams in Chichester, Plymouth, Manchester and Leeds, with Women’s Super League sides Durham, Reading, Sunderland and Tottenham all offering free tickets for their matches.Pienaar, who played just four matches for Bidvest Wits in his homeland before being forced to retire due to mounting injury problems, now plans to move into coaching after this summer’s World Cup. He is grateful to be a part of Everton’s community work after not having the chance to bid farewell when he left the club in 2016. “In my last season I was fighting with a lot of injuries and I knew my contract was coming to an end,” he says. “I just wanted to go out on the field just to say goodbye. I was disappointed but it’s in the past and we just have to move on. To get the chance to come back and do something like this with Everton is fantastic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d80b803b962d8eb6be276c9c61c979e1d09bbfe8/0_46_1590_954/master/1590.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39cfe82e7fa15ea9a8e6496caf6b6f19 1240w","title":"france vegetarian foods no meat words","story":"Makers of ‘vegetarian sausages’ and similar items will no longer be able to use meat-related terms after new rulingFrench MPs have voted to ban producers of vegetarian meat substitutes from using words such as steak, bacon or sausage to describe their products if they are are not partly or wholly composed of meat.

Moreau based his argument on a 2017 judgment by the European court of justice, that ruled that soya and tofu products could not be marketed as milk or butter. “It is important to combat false claims.

Yet even this domestic classic has a thousand variations. We cherry-pick the best to bring you an unbeatable shepherd’s pieThough they may not boast ancient pedigree, the two dishes are not as interchangeable as the likes of Martha Stewart – or indeed, and embarrassingly, the youthful me – would have you believe: just as roast lamb is not cooked in the same way as roast beef, shepherd’s and cottage pie deserve inidual attention. Having tackled the latter way back in 2010, when this column was still wet behind the ears, it feels high time we gave the shepherd his moment in the spotlight. Is this one of those dishes that’s so familiar you don’t need a recipe, or is there anything new to learn about shepherd’s pie?Originally, this was a dish designed to make the Sunday roast go further – the thrifty cook could stretch out the joint until Friday with clever cooking, and such pies were, and still are, often a Monday treat. Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham regard this as a second-best option, writing in The Prawn Cocktail Years that “there is no reason why a shepherd’s pie cannot also be made from a cooked lamb joint, but it turns out better and juicier when made from raw minced meat”.Tom Kerridge and Jamie Oliver clearly disagree, because they roast meat for the purpose: Oliver a lamb shoulder, cooked long, though not particularly low, and then slowly braised in its cooking juices and Kerridge lamb shanks. The testers are excited about these pies after I tell them how long they’ve taken to make, but confess themselves slightly thrown by their consistency, which is, they think, a bit stringy, though both lamb joints had plenty of fat on them.Even lamb mince can vary, however: Eastwood calls specifically for minced lamb shoulder, which she and my butcher explain is a fattier cut than some – and certainly better marbled, darker in colour and stronger in flavour than generic supermarket lamb mince. Whether this is down to the quality of the meat, the cut, or a bit of both is impossible to tell, because the packet stuff doesn’t specify origins, but this dish is certainly worth sourcing decent mince for: it’s never pricey (unless you go down the Ivy road and cut it with minced rib of beef, of course).If you don’t have any lamb drippings handy to cook it in (which you’re unlikely to, unless you’re making it with leftover meat), beef dripping makes a far better, meatier substitute than oil, adding an unmistakable whiff of animal to a dish that was never really going to make the vegetarian heart sing in any case.You can go rogue, if you like – the Ivy puts in shallots, Oliver red onion and Kerridge goes as far as garlic, but I prefer to keep things simple with the time-honoured trinity of yellow onion, celery and carrot, the last cubed, rather than grated as Hopkinson and Bareham suggest, because testers prefer the texture – though, sadly, they’re not keen on Oliver’s swede. I think it seems rather in keeping with the spirit of the dish, though I’d be tempted to bake it first to make it less watery.The Ivy and Eastwood both include mushrooms in their sauces, with the latter writing that many shepherd’s pies lack “depth of flavour. In poncy chef terms, it lacks umami. The mushrooms and mushroom ketchup give this recipe a savoury boost, as do the sun-dried tomatoes.” I agree with her: many recipes do indeed lack a bit of punch, but the testers aren’t keen on the texture of mushrooms here, however finely they’re chopped and the sun-dried tomatoes, though delicious, seem to belong to another dish entirely. “Too fancy,” apparently.But how to add umami without mushrooms or tomato? Meat stock seems the most obvious candidate: slow simmering the mince in lamb stock, as Brown and Hayley and Eastwood recommend, will deliver more savoury flavour than Bareham and Hopkinson’s water. If you can’t find good lamb stock, then beef stock is better than nothing (the Ivy’s veal stock will be, too).Tomatoes are also high in those all-important glutamates – the Ivy uses chopped tomatoes and tomato puree, and Eastwood, Bareham and Hopkinson ketchup, which has its fans, though I find it too sweet and vinegary. Everything ketchup touches ends up tasting of ketchup, so I’m going to use puree instead, plus a good dash of the Ivy’s Worcestershire sauce in place of the Prawn Cocktail Years’ anchovy essence and Kerridge’s red-wine vinegar, which gives his pie a tanginess that works very well with the richness of lamb and potato, but seems at odds with the culinary comfort blanket that is shepherd’s pie.A similar simplicity also seems wise in the herbs and spices department: Eastwood’s exotic star anise, Kerridge’s mace and the Ivy’s oregano are all great options, but you can’t beat thyme and rosemary with lamb.A good shepherd’s – or indeed cottage – pie, needs a solid, but fluffy top: too much milk or butter, and you’ll end up with a sloppy puree instead. Make sure you steam the potatoes dry before mashing, and season generously I like Bareham and Hopkinson’s nutmeg as well as the usual salt and pepper. If you’d like to increase the vegetable content, Eastwood’s butternut squash mash is wonderful, especially with the maple syrup to play off the natural sweetness of the meat, though there should be enough savoury flavour in the filling to negate the need for added cheese (though her parmesan works better than Oliver’s cheddar, and, inspired by Kerridge, I think a hard goat’s cheese would work best of all).Oliver lines his dish with potatoes, too, which I’m excited about – you can never have too much of a good thing – but the panel thinks it makes the dish too claggy, soaking up the gravy and blurring the satisfying distinction between molten filling and dense top. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, if you think it needs extra crunch, but for me a shepherd’s pie needs no other adornment than its traditional crispy furrows, satisfyingly described by Dickson-Wright as “a ploughed field” of potato. And you don’t get much more rustic than that.2 tbsp good beef dripping (or lamb, if you happen to have some)800g minced lamb, goat, hogget or mutton, preferably from the shoulder, but anyway not “lean”1 large onion, thinly sliced2 large carrots, peeled and diced 3 celery sticks, diced2 sprigs each rosemary and thyme, leaves picked and roughly chopped1 tbsp flour300ml good lamb stock (or beef stock) 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp tomato puree1.5kg floury potatoes100g butter1 tbsp whole milkNutmeg, to grateHeat the fat in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish over a medium-high heat, then fry the meat in batches until crisp and well browned all over (not just beige).

Thirty four years ago, when Paul “St Paul” Peterson was the singer in the Family, a band Prince had assembled, he was sitting in his mother’s house in Minneapolis when he received a tape containing Prince’s recording of a song he wanted Peterson to learn for the album he was producing for the group. “I was told to learn Prince’s inflections, his emotions, and the melody line,” the singer remembers, describing how capturing the song’s themes of loss and abandonment meant he had to go “deep”. “So I thought about a girl called Julie, who broke my heart in high school.”It was Nothing Compares 2 U. Prince’s recording went unreleased, the Family’s version became a barely heard album track, but Sinéad O’Connor’s smash 1990 reimagining let the world hear what is now acknowledged as one of Prince’s greatest songs. Today, as Prince’s more electronic, rockier original is finally made public, Peterson – who has been married to Julie for 28 years – is back in his mother’s house. He has just listened to the recording he last heard in 1984 and admits: “I’m freaking out here, man.”Prince’s sound engineer, Susan Rogers, goes back further: she witnessed Nothing Compares 2 U’s birth. In summer 1984, Prince was working in the Flying Cloud Drive Warehouse – his huge rehearsal space before creating Paisley Park – and was on “a creative roll, cranking out a song a day”. He was also in a relationship with the Family’s Susannah Melvoin (who can be heard on backing vocals, alongside St Paul, on Prince’s Nothing Compares 2 U). “It was clear that she was becoming more important than the other girls he’d dated,” Rogers says. “Simultaneously, his young housekeeper, Sandy Scipioni, had to leave suddenly to be with her family because her father died of a heart attack. Sandy ran Prince’s life. He kept asking, ‘When’s Sandy coming back?’”One day, he went into a room with a notebook and, within an hour, emerged with the lyrics to Nothing Compares 2 U. Rogers, who witnessed many such bursts of creativity, remembers, “The song came out like a sneeze.” As usual, she rolled the tapes as Prince laid down instrument after instrument, mixing and overdubbing in the same session (Eric Leeds overdubbed the sax part three days later). Rogers felt the finished song was “exceptional, in his Top 10”, but has a compelling theory about why Prince didn’t release the song under his own name (a live duet with Rosie Gaines appeared years later, on the 1993 compilation, The HitsThe B-Sides).“He wasn’t living with anyone, but he was a young man writing about domesticity. The line ‘all the flowers that you planted in my back yard went out and died’… it would have been Sandy who planted those flowers. ‘And I know that living with me baby is sometimes hard, but I’m willing to give it another try…’ There was no romantic relationship with Sandy. It’s not a pained ‘Help me, baby’ track. It’s: ‘You’re gone and I miss you,’ which is probably why he felt comfortable giving the song away to the Family. He released his material based on what he wanted us to know about him and, wonderful as it is, he didn’t want it to represent him.”“Prince was the most courageous person I ever met,” Rogers explains. “He realised he had to socially handicap himself to be the artist he wanted to be, and that to do that without being an asshole he had to be a complete enigma. My gut feeling is that everything he recorded should be released, so that people can understand where he came from and keep his memory alive.”• Nothing Compares 2 U is available as a stream and digital single. A 7in picture disc is exclusively available via the Prince official store. A black vinyl 7in is out on 25 May. The Family now tour and record as fDeluxe, and appear at the annual Paisley Park celebration in Minneapolis, which runs until 22 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fe16c8ee820d693b4830cbefa23441f5f1db162/2_0_10413_6250/master/10413.jpg?w=10250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1d50ca2e10c45b1f91e8e51e04fa90 20500w","title":"wolves of instagram jordan belmont social media traders","story":"Their hero is Jordan Belfort, their social media feeds display super-rich lifestyles. But what are these self-styled traders really selling? By  Symeon BrownThe original Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, was a rogue trader convicted of fraudulently selling worthless penny stocks to naive investors. His biopic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the ostentatious, money-obsessed huckster, was a box-office hit in 2013. Although it may have been intended as a cautionary tale, to thousands of young millennials from humble backgrounds, Belfort’s story became a blueprint for how to escape an unremarkable life on low pay.Within months of the Wolf of Wall Street’s UK premiere in January 2014, a stocky 21-year-old named Elijah Oyefeso from a south London housing estate, began broadcasting on social media how much money he was making as a stock-market whizzkid. His thousands of young followers were desperate to do the same. As Oyefeso’s online fame grew, he caught the attention of TV producers. In January 2016, Oyefeso was featured in the Channel 4 show Rich Kids Go Shopping, in which he bought expensive jumpers to give to homeless people and showed viewers how easy it was to make stock trades online.Even before Oyefeso’s appearance on mainstream TV, his story had already gone viral. British tabloids, including the Daily Mail, the Evening Standard and the Mirror, as well as a host of online magazines targeted at young men, all ran pieces about his success. The Mail headline described him as a university dropout who supposedly used his student loan to start trading financial products online and “now claims he earns £30,000 on a BAD month – by working just ONE HOUR a day”.It’s an image of self-made wealth and ridiculous luxury, and one that Oyefeso has intensively cultivated online. The videos on his almost comedic YouTube channel, which have hundreds of thousands of views, feature him buying £250,000 cars and boarding private jets as nonchalantly as others his age might hail an Uber. His Instagram, which regularly shows him posing next to a blue and silver Rolls-Royce, describes him as the founder of DCT, his trading firm. DCT stands for “Dreams Come True”.“I’m never going to work for someone,” Oyefeso says in one of his videos, in a somewhat cartoonish, nasal voice, while he drives his Rolls dressed in a bathrobe. “Look what I’ve built: a foundation. A brand.”For many young people from areas such as the poorer part of Camberwell in south London where Oyefeso grew up, or those who have come across him on social media, Oyefeso’s portrayal as a self-made millionaire has given him the heroic status of a footballer or rapper.“I’m just a normal guy and most people who come from where I’m from, they see if I can do it, they can do it,” Oyefeso told me. He has described DCT Trading as a future Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan – except, unlike those mammoth financial institutions, which tend to recruit from a narrow pool of elite graduates from prestigious universities, Oyefeso appeared to be opening a closed door to young people who might otherwise be excluded from the trading floor.Oyefeso has sent out thousands of invitations with the message “join my team”. The problem is, his company does not have a trading floor. It does not have an office. Dreams Come True isn’t registered at Companies House. It does not exist as anything more than a website and some social media accounts. (Oyefeso claims the parent company, Gabs Fossard Ltd, is registered, although it was dissolved without posting any income.)Oyefeso is one of the most high-profile figures of an internet subculture that reveres Jordan Belfort and has taken his Wolf of Wall Street persona to social media. Posing as ultra-wealthy kids and posting internet memes taken from the movie, its followers aggressively sign up young people to what looks like an international pyramid scheme that has helped to generate billions of pounds for large companies selling highly risky financial trading products.They are the wolves of Instagram.The financial sector has a genius for creating new products that brush against the law. A former UBS trader told me that the sector had taken advantage of the grey area between what they know they can’t do and what they believe they can get away with. In 2008, as the economy reeled under the weight of trillions of dollars of bad debt in financial products called collateralised debt obligations, another risky and obscure proposition was being designed for the public: the binary option.The concept is simple: you sign up with a minimum deposit of £250 from a debit or credit card, click a button that says you are over 18, then bet on whether the price of a stock, currency or other financial security will go up or down and by how much. The binary option is part of a family of similar financial products such as spread betting and contracts for difference. If you have ever heard a rookie investor declare that they trade currency, these are probably what they are talking about.These products became popular alongside a proliferation of online trading software and mobile betting platforms. The craze was largely driven by two countries – Israel and Cyprus – in the late 2000s. Their regulatory frameworks meant that firms could access European markets without the heavy hand of European regulators, and new binary options companies spread like chain letters. After the financial crash, in Israel alone an estimated 100 firms popped up in the space of a few years.Over the past 18 months, these financial products have taken great leaps into public life with expensive marketing campaigns. Plus500, which is to online trading what McDonald’s is to fast food, is the main sponsor of European football giant Atlético Madrid, and 24Option have sponsored the renowned MMA fighter Conor McGregor and Italian football team Juventus.Binary options are considered so volatile that they have been banned outright in the US. However, in the UK, which has some of the most liberal financial regulations in the world, they were until January of this year classified as high-risk gambling products and regulated by the Gambling Commission. Since then, they have been under the auspices of the FCA, which published a list of unauthorised firms and guidelines for aspiring traders.The mystery is how such complex products became an internet youth craze. And this is where the wolves of Instagram swagger in. Oyefeso described himself as a social media “influencer”, which means he and others like him can use Instagram and Twitter to sell the trading platforms a supply of teenagers and young adults with limited knowledge of the money markets and a hunger for success.This is how it works. Oyefeso posts images of luxury goods he claims to have bought with his winnings. He gives the pictures hashtags such as #richkidsofinstagram and mass-follows young people online. One teenager told me he and his friends were drawn in by the sight of a young black man who grew up on a council estate similar to theirs, driving a Rolls-Royce. As soon as anyone follows Oyefeso back, he slides into their DMs with a message: “I’m offering a great opportunity to earn £100-400+ per week from trading, no experience required, all done from home and only requires 15-30 min per day.” If you’re young, poor and want to defy the odds against you, the next question is: where do I sign up?What wolves like Oyefeso fail to declare is that each of the trading platforms you sign up to (with a minimum deposit of £250) pays him around £40-80 – and that recruitment, rather than betting on these predatory financial products, is the way he makes his risk-free money (Oyefeso maintains he’s making money from trading). Young people join the platforms, make a few trades and can lose anything between £250 and several thousand pounds, then realise they can make it back by repeating the trick: becoming a paid marketing affiliate masquerading as a successful trader. It looks like a vintage pyramid scheme, rebooted for the social media era using a model of e-marketing that has boomed over the last 20 years.It is almost impossible to count the number of marketing affiliates masquerading as successful traders on Instagram, but we can count the number of promotional posts they’ve made using hashtags such as #binaryoptions (222,206), #traderlifestyle (64,151), and #richkidsofinstagram (529,574). Those numbers rise by the minute and the thousands of accounts generating them appear and disappear constantly.The companies making the real money from these financial gambling products are supposed to be kept in check by the ASA, the Gambling Commission and the FCA – but this pack of regulators appears to be outfoxed by the wolves. The National Fraud Authority estimated that £59m had been defrauded from UK residents in 2017 from binary options alone.“These binary options are almost no-win gambling products masquerading as complex financial instruments,” Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, one of a number of politicians who have issued warnings about such products, told me. “It’s outrageous they are being targeted at the most vulnerable gamblers and young people.”Many of the most exploitative companies’ digital storefronts drift anonymously in the middle of the internet, virtually undiscoverable to people who don’t know they are there and aren’t looking for them. This is where the influencers and their social media accounts come in. In Oyefeso’s words: “I just saw a big hole and I filled it up, which any successful entrepreneur would do.”My first meeting with Oyefeso was on a summer’s afternoon in 2016. He and some of his friends were parked up on a private housing estate in Canary Wharf, having arrived in a convoy of supercars, including Oyefeso’s Rolls and a rented Audi R8. The neighbourhood was meant to serve as a backdrop to the world of opulence they were displaying on their Instagram feeds. It was not long before a resident came out to tell us we were trespassing. “This is a private estate, we don’t want to associate this estate with those kinds of people,” he said.Instagram – even more than Facebook or Twitter – is where people sell a version of their lives that they want people to believe. None more so than these young, self-proclaimed millionaires. They are part of the larger phenomenon of #richkidsofinstagram, a hashtag first used in 2012 to profile the genuine heirs of multimillion-pound estates – including a son of one of the West Ham football club owners – but then spread to people like Oyefeso, who were faking it. A search of the posts tagged #richkidsofinstagram reveals young men and women from across the world sharing pictures and videos of their extravagant lifestyles: suitcases filled with stacks of £10, £20 and £50 notes toddlers wearing customised Gucci denim jackets expensive cars and private jets, all set to the latest hip-hop anthems.For Oyefeso and many of his friends, the lifestyle is largely a costume drama. In his most recent video on YouTube Oyefeso appeared to hire a private jet – one that was parked up – to announce his return after he left prison. Oyefeso recounted how much money he could make in 15 minutes. Yet in reality, the only company I could find registered to Oyefeso’s address – IWANTTOTRADE Ltd, was dissolved in 2016 without posting a penny of income. Despite his glamorous trappings, Oyefeso, the son of Nigerian migrants, is, on paper at least, still residing at their council flat in south London.In reality, #richkidsofinstagram is mostly a feed of adverts selling everything from clothes to gambling products, featuring endless marketing affiliates trying to recruit young people who are under more and more pressure from friends and influencers on social media to buy their way to success. The @richkidslondon account, followed by more than 730,000 people, says it profiles the most impressive rich kids, but what it does not say is that it charges them £60 for a post or £350 for 10.According to a close friend, Oyefeso got his start in this world in 2014, when he began working at One Two Trade (OTT), a bucket shop operated out of a backstreet office in Wapping, east London, where unwitting investors could register bets online. OTT, which is not a regulated financial institution in the UK, but registered in Panama and Malta, would take a cut of every trade, and then try to hustle investors out of the rest of their money using excessive commissions and other exploitative terms. Former staff describe it as overrun with young people who had lost money on the platform, trying to make it back by signing up their friends with trading accounts.For young people with ambition but no access, who were attracted to the risk, ingenuity and wealth of investment banks and hedge funds but would not qualify for a job at a traditional Canary Wharf company, working at OTT felt like a genuine career in the City – despite being unpaid. Oyefeso began styling himself as a guru offering “signals”, or trading tips, while working as a marketing affiliate. According to one of his mentees, he was a frontrunner in a burgeoning scene of young black outsiders, most of whom knew each other, spinning stories about how they infiltrated the old white man’s world of finance.On Oyefeso’s website there is a section where he recommends a range of financial betting platforms. He also showed me a WhatsApp group he charged thousands of young people a £69.99 monthly fee to join, which would instruct them on what to bet on next. Unbeknown to his “clients”, they were the product he was selling.The flashy Instagram may have won him a following, but the biggest gift to Oyefeso was his TV appearance. “After Rich Kids Go Shopping, he was so exposed,” one of his close friends said. “Before, it was just a small black community that was going to him, people that wanted to make quick money would go to him, but when he got put on the TV he had clients in Scotland.”I asked Oyefeso who started the traders of Instagram subculture. “Without being cocky, I think I did,” he said. Without Oyefeso to “show people that you can have this, that you can buy this house, that you can buy this car”, there might not have been the traders of Instagram business model. A rival who copied him agreed. “It started from Elijah,” she said. “He was putting it all on social media. When they are seeing a young black man buy a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce and who is constantly on TV and he’s getting a lot of publicity, they’re thinking, what is this guy doing? I want to be involved.”Then came a binary options gold rush among one of the most unlikely of demographics – young people in Britain’s inner cities.Oyefeso marketed for a range of legitimate companies, including 24Option and AvaTrade, registered in Cyprus and Ireland, respectively, which have an estimated combined annual revenue of nearly $90m. (Neither company responded to a request for comment.) Oyefeso also introduced his young audience to Banc de Binary, a company he describes as “fully good”, even after it ceased trading amid fraud allegations.Banc de Binary was founded in 2009 in Israel. The man at the helm was a former Israeli paratrooper, Oren Shabat Laurent. At its peak, the company had a yearly revenue of $100m, making it a star among binary options companies. The firm sought respectability by sponsoring football teams such as Liverpool and Southampton, but both clubs dropped the company when it become embroiled in scandal.Banc de Binary faced a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits from clients, and was pursued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It was fined $11m for major regulatory breaches such as using shell offices in the UK and the US to evade financial regulations. The company was kicked out of the US in 2013, and was denied access to European markets when it lost its licence in Israel soon after that. In January 2017, the company ceased trading when it was revealed to have used software rigged against its users. Its founder, Laurent, has since reinvented himself in the world of cryptocurrency, with a bigger online following than any of the influencers who peddled binary options for him. Laurent did not respond to requests for comment.Part of what made Oyefeso and Banc de Binary’s practices so ruthless was the age of the people they were signing up. In the UK, you have to be 18 to gamble or speculate on financial transactions. But Oyefeso was openly targeting much younger teenagers. It appears that in doing so, he was violating advertising regulations on gambling products.When I spoke to Oyefeso before he went to prison, he did not exhibit much regret. “I’m not going to lie to you, there are some people under 18 who trade and use their parent’s name,” Oyefeso told me. I asked him if he had worked with anyone under 18 directly. “Of course,” he said. Aren’t you breaching the rules? I asked. “If I am, why aren’t I behind bars?” he said.It seems Oyefeso didn’t just see teenagers as a source of income. They were also a source of labour. I spoke to one 18-year-old who told me that when he was between 15 and 16, he received a message from Oyefeso telling him he could sign up to a trading platform using his mother’s details. Oyefeso then offered the boy and his school friends work running his social media accounts and messaging his followers with advertising scripts. The teenagers were paid a cut of the commission for every one they signed up.The pack of Instagram wolves has spread far beyond Oyefeso’s network in London. Twenty-three-year-old Eddy Samuel grew up on the outskirts of Manchester. The city has received billions in private and public investment, but Samuel was not well placed to benefit from the new jobs that new money created.“I hardly got any GCSEs,” Samuel recently told me. “I got one Btec. I never really had an education.” After a string of minimum-wage jobs, he did some landscape gardening. “That was my last ever job,” he said. Together with two friends, he was drawn into the supposedly glamorous Instagram-world of fast cars and designer clothes that young men the same age as them appeared to have. The pressure to join them was almost torturous.“We are all from council estates – every single one of us,” Samuel said. “Seeing other people do it and wanting to get involved in it ourselves, being broke. I’m out of a job, we’re like – we need something else to get things going.” The company they launched, called Trading XL, has never been registered at Companies House.Even those losing money on Banc de Binary and other platforms sometimes gained a sense of self-confidence and an identity they felt proud of. Young men soon started trading in their hoodies for three-piece, pinstripe suits even though they had no office to wear them to. The subculture even had an anthem. A one-time Instagram trader who goes by the handle 10KJunes released a rap track called Trading Life, which includes the line, “I be selling stocks and then I buy it back, I got the taxman thinking that I’m selling crack”.Technology has made some jobs extinct and endangered entire sectors, but in a tough jobs market, affiliate work seems like the most accessible route to money. There is no interview or licence required. All that is needed, in most cases, is an email address and a bank account. The marketers earn on commission only, so they provide a growing class of cheap labour.A decade ago, teenagers primarily used social media to keep up with their friends and interests. In 2018, many see curating their accounts as a career and there is a growing ecosystem making this a major challenge for advertising regulators. Adverts are supposed to be identifiable, but influencers blur the lines with account pages built as shop windows on their lives. This grey area allowed foreign firms reliant on UK-based influencers to operate with impunity. Experts suggest that the regulators could have gone after marketing affiliates as “facilitators of gambling” sales, but chose not to.Plus500, which is valued at over £1bn, has an estimated 100,000 marketing affiliates working for it alone. The @dailyforexsignals account on Instagram appeared to be promoting the company with posts that the Campaign for Fairer Gambling claimed were in breach of the guidelines. However, Plus500 said the account had signed up just eight clients and the company had long cancelled @dailyforexsignals affiliation. It says it offers customers a test to indicate they understand the terms of trading, and has measures to ensure protection of its customers, including limiting the amount clients can lose. It says it requires all affiliates to comply with industry standards, but it is difficult to see how a company such as Plus500 keeps tabs on the thousands of unmanaged digital workers making it money. This in turn makes it hard to stop it profiting from vulnerable consumers – in particular, from young people hooked in by the promise of easy wealth.In 2005, the Labour government liberalised gambling advertising and created the Gambling Commission to regulate commercial gambling and protect vulnerable people, including anyone under 25. Tom Watson, the current deputy Labour leader, admitted that the legislation didn’t take the digital era into account.“The yield taken from losers in the industry has gone up from £8bn in 2008 to £13bn in 2016,” Watson said. “That’s a lot of money, and when you combine that with recent news that companies are targeting the most vulnerable people who are susceptible to becoming problem gamblers – I think we’ve got a problem and our current regulations and laws are not fit for purpose.”Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, alleges that the wolves’ Instagram posts are breaching two ASA regulations, “the first of which is: you can’t market to young people, and the second is: gambling cannot be offered as a way of making money. So these adverts would never pass the regulators if they were conventional.”The Gambling Commission has admitted that it had received a growing number of complaints when it was in the process of trying to regulate binary options, but the Campaign for Fairer Gambling says neither it nor the ASA had taken strong enough action on the advertising of such profits to vulnerable young adults. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it had never even “written to Instagram relating to advertisements or posts promoting gambling, that breach the UK advertising codes” during the time of the steepest rise in complaints.Both regulators blame the 2005 legislation. The Gambling Commission said that although binary options were regulated, the rules only applied if the firm had “remote gambling equipment located in Great Britain, irrespective of whether there are offices in GB or not”. The law states that if equipment is not in Britain, any binary options that the firm offers will not be regulated. Last month, the European Securities and Market Authority decided to prohibit the sales of binary options and limit the marketing and distribution of related products to vulnerable retail consumers. However, the wolves of Instagram have already adapted their behaviour.“Everything is changing, so obviously I’ve got to change, too,” Oyefeso said to me last year, when the landscape began to shift.One of Oyefeso’s business associates has leapt headfirst into the latest gold rush. “I recently got into bitcoin about three months ago,” he said. “Young people have just jumped to it and it’s like the (binary options) trading bubble all over again.”The cryptocurrency craze is in many ways similar to the boom in binary options and digital gambling apps. There have now been over 1,560 different currencies launched. Most of them are worthless but a host of new platforms are trying to hawk them via dubious platforms that entice young people through marketing affiliates disguised as Instagram influencers.One of Oyefeso’s early proteges was a north Londoner called Olivia James, 23. She described the original Wolf of Wall Street as “a king in my eyes”, and in February tweeted “I’m do everything Belfort done and more lifestyle wise”. Hoping to take advantage of the popularity of bitcoin, James has now incorporated a new company called TRADEtoGAIN, with 20-year-old Armon Rabiee and 24-year-old Luke Arliss. The trio share a common story with many of the other young people founding pop-up sites to teach young adults how they can crack cryptocurrencies, for exorbitant fees. Arliss struggled at school, James was repeatedly turned down for entry level jobs in the City and Rabiee said he lost thousands during the binary options wave as a teenager. Together, they plan to make money as gurus of crypto.Arliss, who has a big Instagram following from his former company, which repaired bodywork on footballers’ cars, said that he gets “loads of messages” about crypto from young people “interested in the hype”. Rabiee piped in, claiming that with their special insight they “can charge people thousands”.As Oyefeso’s fairytale has unravelled, the internet has turned against him. People shared reports of his arrest and sentence with mocking comments, and published blogs accusing him of running scams. Oyefeso responded with a caption on a recent video post: “People don’t want to see a young black guy from the ends make it out to be successful,” he wrote.The problem, in Oyefeso’s case, has not been a lack of goodwill. There were many who shared his original rags to riches story, unaware that there was another version in which this apparently wealthy young trader was an invention, incentivised by companies happy to exploit the gap between the life millennials are persuaded they should be living, and the harsh economic reality they live in.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91051e1cd080a63229423c43d066ee286ab1f261/946_471_3705_2223/master/3705.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f971ae293c3d8b25c7e2dc6f25d7066 1240w","title":"backbench mps motion force vote eu customs union","story":"Theresa May faces new rebellion after House of Lords defeat Theresa May next week faces a show of defiance from MPs fighting to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU after 10 select committee chairs tabled a motion aimed at forcing a vote on the issueThree Conservatives – Bob Neill, Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston – are among the signatories to the motion, which urges the government to “include as an objective in negotiations ... the establishment of an effective customs union”.The government lost a vote in the House of Lords on Wednesday night by a hefty majority of 123 on a cross-party amendment that would force ministers to report to parliament on their moves to keep the UK in a customs union.MPs campaigning against a hard Brexit, including Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna, have tabled amendments to the trade bill and customs bill demanding that the option of a customs union be kept on the table.But the government has delayed bringing the legislation back to the Commons, avoiding the risk of an embarrassing defeat, so the select committee chairs are using their power to raise issues in the Commons to force a vote.Other signatories include Labour’s Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Norman Lamb, and the Scottish National party’s Angus MacNeil.Supporters of a customs union hope the debate will underline the lack of support in parliament for taking the UK out of the customs union.Soubry said: “You will get the mood of the House: that’s important. If Theresa May wanted to, she could change her mind on this.”But Jacob Rees Mogg, chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of backbenchers, warned against the liaison committee - made up of the select committee chairs - politicising its role.“It is unusual for the liaison committee to propose a motion and makes it more a political pressure group rather than the guardians of the rights of the House of Commons. In behaving this way, it regrettably devalues itself,” he said.The motion from the committee chairs came as the government dismissed claims that its proposals for avoiding border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic had been subjected to a “forensic annihilation” by EU negotiators.After talks on Wednesday between the two sides, the Telegraph quoted senior EU diplomatic sources saying the government’s proposals for resolving the issue had been rejected. “It was a detailed and forensic rebuttal. It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work. None of them.”While government sources rejected the idea that May’s proposals had been comprehensively dismantled by negotiatiors, they are concerned about what they regard as the inflexible approach adopted by the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his team.A government spokesman said: “We have been clear that we will protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. That commitment was set out in December’s joint report which also includes our guarantee of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We are continuing an intensive work programme to engage on all the scenarios set out in the joint report.” Those wanting to remain in a customs union – which would avoid border checks, but constrain the UK from striking its own trade deals – are concerned about the impact on the economy if the UK left.The motion “notes the government’s expressed aim to provide the freest and most frictionless possible trade” with the EU and “further notes the importance of frictionless trade without tariffs, customs or border checks for manufacturers and businesses”.Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, and Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said: “With just six months to go before the Brexit deal needs to be concluded, we are running out of time for parliament to help to shape the negotiations. “Yet many of our backbench committees have forensically gathered evidence on different Brexit options and the practical implications. That is why committee chairs at the liaison committee – including those who voted leave and who voted remain, supporters and opponents of a customs union – concluded that backbench MPs should get the chance of an early constructive debate and vote on this crucial issue, not bound by the party whips, but informed by committee evidence instead.“If parliament stays silent until after the deal is done, that is just a recipe for conflict and regret later on. Far better for us to debate this properly now and let parliamentarians express their view before it is too late.”The vote will be non binding but, after the defeat in the Lords on Wednesday, its proponents hope it will demonstrate there is no majority in the Commons for leaving the customs union, something May has insisted on since her Lancaster House speech last January.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “This is further evidence of the growing chorus of cross-party voices concerned that Theresa May’s position on a customs union is wrong in principle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a962e846e4b01257124acad6d9c70cf84838aea/0_516_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0525da0d6d1c77f3eb66eaf24cdf1fd2 1240w","title":"mystery of sea nomads amazing ability to freedive is solved","story":"Scientists have uncovered the secrets of the Bajau people, long-famed for their ability to hold their breath for extraordinary lengths of timeThe secret behind the ability of a group of “sea nomads” in Southeast Asia to hold their breath for extraordinary periods of time while freeing to hunt fish has finally been revealed – and it’s down to evolution.The Bajau people are able to e tens of metres underwater with no conventional ing aids. Instead they rely on weights, handmade wooden goggles – and a single breath of air.But while the Bajau people’s talents have long been known, it was unclear whether the skill was the result of practice, as in the case of the excellent underwater vision of Thai “sea nomad” children, or the result of adaptations which have their roots in the Bajau people’s DNA.Now experts say they have the answer: over time the Bajau people have undergone natural selection, resulting in certain versions of genes becoming widespread – many of which are linked to biological changes, including having a larger spleen, that could help the Bajau to hold their breath underwater for many minutes at a time.The team say the findings could eventually prove useful in medical settings, potentially allowing experts to identify patients that might be at greater risk of death if they experience a lack of oxygen, for example during surgery.“There seems to be so much to learn from the Bajau and other ing populations about how the human body is able to react to oxygen deprivation, which is an important medical issue,” said Dr Melissa Ilardo, first author of the study who was at the University of Copenhagen at the time of the research. Writing in the journal Cell, the scientists reveal how they unpicked the mystery following a clue from previous research: species of seals which can e for longer have larger than expected spleens – an organ which, among its functions, can store oxygen-carrying red blood cells. As a result the team used an ultrasound device to measure the spleen in 43 Bajau people and 33 people from a neighbouring group of farming people, the Saluan.The team note the trend held regardless of whether the Bajau inidual was themselves a er, and even when factors such as age, sex and height were taken into account.Genetic testing revealed that certain versions of genes are more commonly found in Bajau people than would be expected, with many apparently linked to biological changes that could help iniduals cope with low-oxygen conditions. Among them is a form of a gene linked to an increased spleen size – an effect the team reveal is likely down to an increase in thyroid hormone levels. Crucially, a contraction of the spleen is one of the features of the so called “ing reflex” – a set of responses in mammals that occur when the head is submerged. A large spleen means even more oxygen-carrying red blood cells can be pumped into the circulatory system when the organ contracts, allowing iniduals to stay underwater for longer.Another is a form of a gene linked to a different feature of the ing reflex: narrowing of the blood vessels to the extremities, aiding delivery of oxygenated blood to organs such as the brain, heart and lungs.Further analysis by the team revealed that these genetic boons are not the result of chance, but evolutionary adaptations arising from natural selection. Stephen Stearns, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University who was not involved in the research, saidthe study adds to evidence for recent natural selection on certain genes in human populations – with previous examples including genes for lactose tolerance that cropped up with the advent of domestication of dairy animals, and genes for adaptation to high altitude in Tibetans and Native Americans in the Andes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd58a8750d2bd2195788c578b69025b42b16afc/0_315_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ac87cf9f032ed31c497b9b59f201be86 1240w","title":"cow could soon be largest mammal left due to human activity study says","story":"Researchers examining extinction of large mammals as humans spread across the world see worrying trend The cow could be left as the biggest land mammal on Earth in a few centuries, according to a new study that examines the extinction of large mammals as humans spread around the world. The spread of hominims – early humans and related species such as Neanderthals – from Africa thousands of years ago coincided with the extinction of megafauna such as the mammoth, the sabre-toothed tiger and the glyptodon, an armadillo-like creature the size of a car. “There is a very clear pattern of size-biased extinction that follows the migration of hominims out of Africa,” the study’s lead author, Felisa Smith, of the University of New Mexico, said of the study published in the journal Science on Thursday. Humans apparently targeted big species for meat, while smaller creatures such as rodents escaped, according the report, which examined trends over 125,000 years. In North America, for instance, the mean body mass of land-based mammals has shrunk to 7.6kg (17lb) from 98kg after humans arrived. If the trend continues “the largest mammal on Earth in a few hundred years may well be a domestic cow at about 900kg”, the researchers wrote. That would mean the loss of elephants, giraffes and hippos. In March, the world’s last male northern white rhino died in Kenya. But other research casts doubt on a continued shrinking of mammals, partly because of conservation efforts to stave off threats to wildlife such as climate change, loss of forest habitats, pollution and expanding cities.The International Union for Conservation of Nature chief scientist, Thomas Brooks, who was not involved in the study, said the projection of ever smaller mammals was “doom and gloom”. “Happily, I don’t think it’s very likely,” he said, adding that other research suggests large animals such as elephants are more likely to benefit in protected areas than smaller ones. And a red list of threatened species, maintained by the union, also lists some wild mammals roughly the size of a cow – such as the African buffalo or the brown bear – as unendangered. The Science study also excludes marine mammals such as the blue whale, the largest creature that has ever existed. It is listed as endangered on the red list but the populations are rising after a moratorium on hunting. Smith said “my optimist hat would like to say that it’s not going to happen because we love elephants”. But she said populations of large land mammals were falling and “declining population is the trajectory to extinction”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1ea4254135753a5fad96e5ce4b38a5ac44068a/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=313224d4cc60e928f43dee809b984476 1240w","title":"oregon too much weed oversupply what happened 420","story":"The state’s glut of marijuana – over 1m lb of unsold pot – is in many ways the result of an industry still finding its feetTrey Willison, a cannabis farmer in Eugene, first started worrying last May about there being too much marijuana in Oregon. He had sold all his “clone” plants to other growers, who were using them to cultivate yet more marijuana.“You start doing the math on that and it just didn’t make sense how people could be growing that many plants,” Willison said.Fast-forward nearly a year and Oregon does indeed have a glut of marijuana there are over 1m lb of usable but unsold marijuana, according to the state tracking system. That’s more than 128m “eighths” of weed, and almost three times the amount of cannabis sold in Oregon in all of last year.Flooded with supply, prices are dropping so much that some dispensaries in the Portland area are selling the drug for $4 a gram. That’s less than half the cost of a bargain-basement batch in other US cities where marijuana is legal, like Denver and Seattle.When the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), the agency in charge of cannabis regulation, issued the first licenses to businesses in 2016, projections were for 800 to 1,200 businesses to obtain cannabis licenses in the first couple of years, according to Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the OLCC.But 1,824 marijuana-related business licenses have already been issued, including 981 production operations. Another 967 production licenses are in various stages of approval by the state and could come online later this year.Molly Conroy, the program director for the Oregon Cannabis Association, cautioned that this is a brand new market that needs time to adjust.“Every agricultural crop has its highs and its lows,” she said. “No pun intended.”Unlike Colorado, which also legalized marijuana, many of the cannabis farms in Oregon are outdoors because the plants thrive in the state’s warm, sunny summers. But the first year that recreational cannabis farms were licensed, a rainstorm hammered the crop just before the prime flower harvest in October.“A lot of crop got destroyed,” said Pettinger. “It wasn’t salvageable because it had mildew or mold on it. So there was a not a real accurate gage of what the market looked like.”Demand remained high – so, by last fall, hundreds more farms had obtained licenses. And a long, favorable growing season made for a bumper crop. Suddenly, the state had more marijuana than it knew what to do with.Cannabis flowers have a shelf life of several months but after a while, the product gets stale. Andrew Lessar owns Oregon CO2, a company that extracts oils from cannabis flowers, then sells the oils to producers of edibles. Lessar said he gets between five and 10 calls a week from growers who are desperate to generate some income from their flowers.“If I see an unknown number on my phone, I know it’s going to be someone saying, ‘We’ve got 500 lb,’ ‘We’ve got 2,000 lb… Can you help us?’”But Lessar said that because of the way cannabis is regulated, he can’t sell the oils back to the producer. They need to already have a buyer lined up or obtain a $5,000 license that covers a different part of the farm-to-consumer process.And because US federal law still prohibits cannabis, Oregon growers can’t legally sell outside the state’s borders.Tristan Reisfar works part-time for a company, High Desert Pure, that produces vapor cartridges and said he fields phone calls from desperate growers offering to sell their marijuana for as little as $100 per lb. When Oregon launched its recreational marijuana program, it was common for growers to count on bringing in $2,400 per lb.“We’re coming into another growing season here, what are they going to do then?” Reisfar asked.Reisfar also co-hosts a weekly marijuana-themed talk radio show called The High Desert Co-op. He said he gets calls every week from growers who are looking to sell their cannabis farms and want his promotional help.Willison, the co-owner of Eugenius LLC, said he still has “a couple hundred lb of product in our vault”.He has pared down his operation from 16 employees to seven. Three-quarters of the farm has been switched from cannabis to hemp seed. Hemp is a related plant that doesn’t offer the same high as cannabis, but has a variety of uses including fabric and medicine. He plans to keep growing marijuana to maintain his brand until the market rebounds. In the meantime, he estimates that the marijuana portion of his business is losing between $5,000 and $10,000 a month.“This glut’s going to take a few years. There is really no short-term answer,” Willison said.So what’s to come of that 1m lb of weed? Reisfar said that as cannabis flowers age, some of the chemical components that cause a narcotic high break down into slightly different components which instead cause drowsiness.“That’s another factor in their desperation,” he said of the growers. “That weed is turning into something that they didn’t start out trying to make: sleepy time weed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79c2b882f2e0102a7a39b1b54ff800bc4040c84a/0_157_2943_1766/master/2943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d233df963e342cec1b3fec59a8d64626 1240w","title":"hull fc leeds rhinos super league match report","story":"Marc Sneyd has made a habit of producing game-winning moments for Hull in recent years and this was the second time in little over a fortnight the 27-year-old has kicked the decisive point to secure victory.Leeds touched down three times in 11 minutes to lead by four points in the second half, but Carlos Tuimavave’s try levelled the scores and Sneyd’s drop goal secured Hull’s first Super League home victory against Leeds since September 2014.His half-back partner Albert Kelly also played a significant part in the victory. The stand-off is reportedly garnering interest in the National Rugby League about a potential move home. While he remains at Hull they undoubtedly have a magnificent – albeit sometimes erratic – talent.“Albert was very tidy,” the Hull coach, Lee Radford, said. “But better than his game in attack was his defence he was racking up some incredible numbers and he was great.”Kelly was at his menacing best here against Leeds, having a hand in all four of Hull’s tries which originally put them into a commanding 14-point lead, before the Rhinos rallied magnificently to lead by four with 15 minutes remaining.After Kelly’s kick led to the try by Tuimavave to level the scores, though, Sneyd kicked the match-winning drop goal which moved Hull into the top four and secured their first Super League victory over the reigning champions since 2014.Leeds fall to sixth on the Super League table as a result of this defeat, but the focal point of their coach, Brian McDermott, here was not the result – which he insisted Hull merited – but the way Super League games are being officiated this season.“Challenge Cup finals don’t have as many penalties in them,” he said. “Semi-finals and play-off games don’t. We play a different game for the first two thirds of the season than we do at the end.”His counterpart agreed. “I think it’s statistically proven that when the Super\u0026nbsp8s come around, the pea isn’t blown out of the whistle as much,” Radford said. “Why? I don’t know.”By and large, Hull and Kelly were impressive throughout. After the stand-off provided inch-perfect passes for Jake Connor and Bureta Faraimo to cross, he then provided another wonderful assist for Connor’s second after the break.The only negative was that Sneyd converted only one of those tries and when Leeds hit back through Joel Moon, Ryan Hall and Matt Parcell – the latter awarded as a penalty try following alleged foul play from Josh Bowden – Kallum Watkins nervelessly converted all three to put the Rhinos four points ahead.Hull and Kelly, though, were not done – and nor was Sneyd. Although he failed to convert Tuimavave’s try with seven minutes remaining to leave the scores locked, he was not as wasteful with his first – and only – drop goal attempt with four minutes remaining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/009c31d3677af6b968445a8e882fb8c5fa2faeb8/0_170_4391_2634/master/4391.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2cb827fa179e82f07d08dcceff94115f 1240w","title":"mo farah reputation tainted association salazar","story":"The British marathon record holder Steve Jones fears Mo Farah will always be tainted by his association with Alberto Salazar – and says he wishes he had left his former coach years ago.Jones fully expects Farah to shatter his 33-year-old UK record of 2hr\u0026nbsp7min\u0026nbsp13sec during the London Marathon on Sunday and even thinks his fellow Briton could challenge for the world record one day. But he does not understand why Farah decided to stay loyal to Salazar’s Nike Oregon Project training group until 2017, two years after they started to be investigated by the US\u0026nbspAnti-Doping Agency – an investigation that continues.“Personally, I would have distanced myself,” Jones said. “I said that three years ago when this whole thing blew up about Salazar. The people at Portland thought I was telling Mo to quit Salazar and get away as far as possible. I was just saying distance yourself until it either all falls back into place or the stories became true.”Jones, who is now a distance coach in Colorado, said he was well aware of Salazar’s reputation for pushing himself to the limits since he began racing him during the 80s. “We have had some times together and I know his abilities,” he said.“I know he is a little crazy. In marathon we are all nuts and raisins. It is what level you are. Alberto always takes things to the nth degree. I think that is what he has done with his coaching and his training.”Jones said Salazar’s well-publicised health problems – his heart stopped for 14 minutes in 2007 – may have been a consequence of driving himself too hard. “That is what happens when you overdo things. I mean this is a little unfair to be talking about all this when we’re talking about Mo. I’m not trying to say this is the avenue Mo is taking, or anything, but there is a little taint there. It is guilt by association, I suppose, which is very unfair.”Farah, who has always strenuously denied breaking any rules, is now coached by Gary Lough since quitting the track last year. Salazar has also consistently denied any wrongdoing after the BBC and ProPublica alleged he had broken anti-doping rules in 2015.The 62-year-old Jones is delighted his marathon record is finally being challenged and is confident he will be bidding it a fond goodbye on Sunday. “I never thought the record would last so long. It is surprising. Although when I did it I kind of blew up in the last five or six miles so it could have been a little quicker had I not been so aggressive early on.“When I look at my 2:07 I’m really looking at 2:05 but it’s good to see it being challenged now. I should just wave the white flag now and hand it over. I was confident in 2014 it would go, although when Mo went from talking about winning the race to breaking my record it made me think he wasn’t quite so confident. This time it’s a foregone conclusion – even a bad run this time should break the British record.”The forecast of 23C for Sunday is likely to scupper the plans of the Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge and the Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele to challenge Dennis Kimetto’s world marathon record of 2:02:57 set in 2014.Kipchoge ran 2:00:25 in Monza last May, but it did not count as a new best under IAAF rules because he was helped by a phalanx of pacemakers who subbed in and out of the race. However he believes he is capable of taking on Kimetto’s time at some point. “Personally I know that one day I will break a world record,” he said. “It might be too hot on Sunday but everyone is running in the same weather. I promise we will see a beautiful race.”Kipchoge’s coach, Patrick Sang, said his man was in very similar shape to his epic run in Monza when he came so close to being the first man to run under two hours – albeit with extra help. “But the heat, of course, will have an effect,” Sang said. “To what degree, I don’t know, but it will have an impact.”When asked whether there was still a hope of a world record on Sunday, Sang nodded before replying: “If the temperature comes down a little bit there is a big chance.”Unfortunately for Kipchoge and Bekele the increasingly certain weather forecasts suggest that chance is dwindling by the hour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/935f942135de59fe562d7bc1bf6a9feb09e9ae54/53_60_5799_3480/master/5799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83a5c10007bf43c5a8cf31d50be777e2 1240w","title":"whats the best email service that doesnt scan emails for ad targeting","story":"Jim doesn’t want his emails scanned for targeted ads, but while there are ways to avoid it, surveillance-based advertising is rifeWhat’s the best free email service provider that does not scan or use the data in your emails for advertising? JimFree email services are usually paid for by showing you advertisements. Some email services scan your emails in order to show you personalised or targeted ads. You could argue that that’s a benefit, because you’ll see ads in which you might have some interest. You could also argue that your emails are private, so it’s an invasion of privacy. Either way, it’s different from scanning your emails to stop viruses and phishing attempts, which nobody wants to stop.There are several options, but the problem is bigger than you may think, and likely to get worse.When Google launched Gmail in 2004, it did indeed scan your emails for advertising purposes. You could only avoid it by using a paid-for version of the service. That changed last summer, when Google announced that it would no longer scan emails to tailor adverts.That didn’t mean you would get adverts picked at random. As Alex Hern explained here, “the adverts will now be targeted in the same way as other Google services, based on information gleaned from other activity on users’ profiles, such as their searches, browsing activity, and even physical locations”.Google has the world’s largest known tracking system, thanks partly to Google Analytics – which is used on far more websites than any Facebook tracker – and its DoubleClick advertising business. Add Google Search and it already knows so much about you that scanning your emails may well be superfluous. The good news is that you can delete a lot of it, with the help of a Guardian article by Dylan Curran: Here is all the data Facebook and Google have on you.The problem is that Google has lots of other reasons to read your email, and you may find some of them useful. For example, Google might tell you about traffic jams or flight delays, put appointments in your calendar, or offer to write quick email replies for you. These features involve AI software reading your emails, tracking your website visits, and your location. In the future, it may include information from home speakers (Google Home etc), household gadgets (Nest etc), fitness bands, smartwatches, cars (Waymo) and other connected devices.As AI gets smarter, there will be more and more opportunities for companies to track you, profile you, and help you.In other words, scanning emails to tailor advertising is a relatively minor issue in the great scheme of things. The larger problem is that the whole web economy is based on surveillance, and there’s very little you can actually do about it. Even if you try to stay anonymous and block cookies, you might be identified by techniques such as device profiling, fingerprinting, and AI systems that can recognise your typing.Neither of the two largest email services – Google’s Gmail and Microsoft’s Outlook.com – scans your emails for advertising purposes. If you want to avoid those, Zoho Mail is a good alternative. It’s primarily aimed at business users, and includes an online office suite and other features. It offers a free service with 5GB of mail storage space, so you can try it. You may find it’s worth paying €24 per year for 30GB of storage and other features such as domain aliases and Microsoft Active Sync support.ProtonMail, which is based in Switzerland, is one of the most privacy-conscious email services, and offers encrypted and self-destructing emails. However, it only provides 500MB of storage to non-paying users. ProtonMail Plus costs €48 per year for 5GB of storage, while ProtonMail Visionary costs €288 per year for 20GB. You’d be more likely to use this as a supplementary service than for all your emails.FastMail is a popular alternative, because it offers good support with no ads and no tracking, but it’s not free. The Basic service with 2GB of storage costs $30 per year, while 25GB costs $50 and 100GB costs $90 per year. There’s a 30-day free trial so you can test it first, and a migration guide to help you switch from another supplier.Most people now access their email service via a web browser. The pre-web alternative was to use an email client program to download new emails to your PC. If you use an email client then you won’t see any targeted adverts even if your emails are scanned.In the old days, email programs used POP3, the Post Office Protocol. The software downloaded your emails then deleted them from the mail server. This has mostly been replaced by IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), which downloads emails and leaves them on the server, unless you delete them deliberately. This means you can download the same emails to several PCs, or read them online with a different smartphone, tablet or PC, etc.Email programs have fallen on relatively hard times, and Microsoft has discontinued the Windows Live Mail program that was popular with Ask Jack readers, (although it still works). This is partly because devices may already include a mail app, and the Mail and Calendar app in Windows 10 is actually pretty good for most users. It supports multiple accounts, not just Outlook.com, and there are companion Outlook apps for Android and Apple smartphones.Alternatives include Mozilla’s free and open source Thunderbird, which runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux, and Windows programs such as Mailbird and eM Client. Mailbird Lite is free but you can get Mailbird Pro for $39 (or $19.50 at the time of writing). eM Client is free for non-commercial use but there’s a Pro version for £35.94.Business users tend to use Microsoft Outlook, which is one of the main Office programs. Outlook is not included in the Home and Student edition, but you could pick up a cheap version of Office 2016 Professional. Alternatively, you could subscribe to Office 365 Personal (£$59.99 per year for one user), or Office 365 Home (£$79.99 per year for five users), and download it. Each Office 365 user gets 1TB of storage, which makes it economical.The online advertising industry has a self-regulatory body called the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which offers advice to consumers. There’s also the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a non-profit organisation that describes itself as “the leading self-regulatory association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for digital advertising”.The NAI has an “opt out” page, which sets an opt-out cookie that will be respected by NAI members. You will still see ads, but most will not be targeted ads. It offered me the chance to opt out of targeted ads from 90 members, including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. You have to run it in every browser you use.You can also install the EFF’s Privacy Badger andor the open source Ghostery browser add-on. Privacy Badger tries to enforce Do Not Track if you have that turned on in your browser.Another idea is to use Firefox’s first-party isolation (FPI) feature, which Mozilla has adopted from the Tor browser. To turn it on, paste the following into the address bar and set the top preference to True:This may create log-in problems so it’s better to use an extension instead.A more practical idea, currently, is to use a Firefox container to isolate a particular site. Mozilla offers a Facebook Container extension, which makes it easy. The full Multi-Account Containers extension lets you keep any site – or group of sites – separate. It was designed to let you, for example, log into two or more different accounts on one service in the same browser at the same time. However, you could use a container to isolate Gmail or any other service.Have you got a question?

They emerged moments later on a nearby islet, with an inquisitive look and a mildly concerned peep.I powered the paddleboard towards the white beach and, as it scuffed against the sand, jumped into the clear waters. Pulling the board above the high-tide line, I took a deep breath. The sun was beginning its fall behind the Small Isles of Muck, Eigg and Rùm, casting bright orange and red light against the clouds. Further north, the foreboding Black Cuillins of Skye were wrapped in swirling dark cloud. To the east, over the water we’d just paddled, the last of the sunlight was easing up the snow-specked Knoydart and Moidart mountains.Just off the beach I was standing on, shags dipped into the water and young, curious seals popped up, peering at us. The older seals kept their distance on the skerries, the tiny islets we’d just paddled past. A tent on this little, uninhabited island, accessed across a narrow channel off the west coast of Scotland, would be our home tonight: our hotel of a million stars.I climbed up to the high point of the island, my hands wrapped around a carved wooden cup filled with a dram of Islay whisky, and watched the sun’s dramatic final act. Without thinking, I took my phone out of my pocket and tapped Instagram. “No service,” it read. A hint of frustration briefly rose, then I turned it off. Instead, I watched the crimson clouds turn grey. We spent the evening eating, enjoying a bottle of red and gazing at the stars. The gentle splash of waves against our island (for it felt like it was ours for that night) was the lullaby.In a life dominated by deadlines, updates, notifications and emails, I often seek breaks from the barrage of digital life. The hashtags I follow on Instagram these days are more #vanlife, #mountainlife, #minimalism (and no, I’m not missing the irony of this). A simpler existence is what I’m looking for, if only I could leave my bloody iPhone alone.Feeling pretty certain that there would be no reception in a tent on an island off the west coast of Scotland, I had jumped on the Caledonian Sleeper at Euston, bound for Fort William and a new two-day stand-up paddleboarding experience called a Digital Detox Adventure, with Wilderness SUP.I fell asleep to the lights of Luton whizzing past my window and awoke to the snow-capped summits of the Scottish Highlands. I had my breakfast as the train heaved up to Corrour station, the highest in Britain, before descending into Fort William.Barry Wallace, the owner of Wilderness SUP, greeted me with a big smile and a hug. “Our trips are about experiencing the landscape, the culture and food of the Scottish Highlands,” he said in a mellifluous Scots accent. “The slow travel of a standup paddleboard is how we access those experiences.”We met Rachel, a friend of Barry’s and a local photographer, on a peninsula near Arisaig (the weather and tides dictate the location). On a previous SUP experience I had become well acquainted with the sea life of the Dorset coast using a solid board, but today we were on inflatable boards. “Much more stable,” said Barry.I practised in a small tidal pool under the watchful eye of a heron. “Power is your friend,” Barry said. On the slightly rougher sea I paddled on my knees, which felt as secure as a canoe but when we arrived in the shelter of the islands I could stand again, developing a rhythmic pull of the paddle.We hopped off on a beach littered with spiral shells and razor clams, jumped across rocks like kids and wrote our names in the sand. I may have whooped.“It’s like a soft reset button for the mind, body and soul,” Barry said, later that evening. “People arrive in a heightened state, not knowing what to expect. Then, after a few hours, you begin to notice the nuances of the sea, how the wind blows, the changes in air temperature, how the clouds move, the birds, the flow of nature. Even the act of paddling is meditative.“Being close to the water brings calm to the mind. I always believe I come back better from trips like this.”Back on dry land, we spent a night at the cosy bunkhouse at the nearby Glenuig Inn on the Sound of Arisaig. I pretended there was no wifi and enjoyed an afternoon wandering the bays and villages. It felt as though I’d been away for a week. • A two-day, one-night Digital Detox SUP Adventure with Wilderness SUP costs £250pp including wild camping.

He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija. Alfred Degiorgio’s personal phone and the device said to be his burner phone appear to remain there all night and most of the following day.16 October:1.41am - Trigger sim is switched on. It signals from Bidnija, where Caruana Galizia’s car is parked outside her home.8am - The Maya is filmed on CCTV leaving Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Phone data suggests only George Degiorgio was on board.8.30am – The Vodafone mast in Bidnija goes off grid and is closed for maintenance until 6pm.2.55pm - CCTV shows the Maya stopping in sheltered water beneath the Siege Bell war memorial.2.58pm –  Text message is allegedly sent from the boat to the circuit board sim, detonating a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of Caruana Galizia’s car.3.20pm – Phone data shows the Maya heading back towards the harbour.3.30pm - George Degiorgio sends a message from his personal phone to his partner: “Buy me wine, my love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea66dd5623455c3df59466e9daf78426153dda0/0_157_4714_2828/master/4714.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3d93ca3bb59d5438ad69dde4d9481504 1240w","title":"cuba president miguel diaz canel modernise economy","story":"Cuba’s new president has promised to modernize the country’s economy and make the government more responsive to its people, even as he pledged to uphold the values of the country’s socialist revolution.Miguel Díaz-Canel was sworn in as president on Thursday, becoming the island’s first leader without the Castro surname for the first time in almost 60 years.At a functionalist conference centre in Havana, Díaz-Canel, 57, read a brief speech which sought to reconcile revolutionary continuity with a recognition of the need for change. He said there would be no “capitalist restoration”, but promised to make better use of the internet and push on with “the modernization of our social and economic model”.He finished his address with the familiar rhetorical flourish: “Socialism or Death! We will triumph!”Raúl Castro, 86 – who stood down as president after 12 years in the office but remains first secretary of the Communist party – embraced Díaz-Canel, and gave his presidency a ringing endorsement.But he left no doubt where power still lies. In an uncharacteristically long speech, in which he repeatedly joked and went off script, Castro emphasised the need to fight corruption – and said he would stay on to guide his successor.An electronics engineer by training, Díaz-Canel became party chief in his home province of Villa Clara in the 1990s. In 2003, he was moved to be party chief in Holguin province, a centre of Cuba\u0027s burgeoning tourism industry and foreign investment. In 2009, he was summoned to Havana to be higher education minister, and in 2013 Castro appointed him as first-vice president. Since then he has stood in for Castro at political events, received foreign dignitaries and travelled abroad on behalf of the government.\u0026nbspDíaz-Canel\u0027s policy views remain mostly an enigma in a country where political campaigning is banned. On the one hand he is from a younger generation of leaders and has advocated modernising Cuba on the other he is a longtime Communist party apparatchik who is not expected to push for sweeping political change.As a young provincial party chief, he bucked party orthodoxy by backing an LGBT-friendly cultural centre in Santa Clara, reportedly listening to rock music and sporting long hair. At a national level, he called for more critical coverage of events in state-run media and broader internet access to open one of the world\u0027s least web-connected societies.\u0026nbspUltimately though, he appears to have earned Castro\u0027s trust by sticking to the party line on key political and economic issues, analysts say.While Díaz-Canel\u0027s public persona has been reserved, even dour, since he joined the national government nine years ago, residents in his home province of Villa Clara enthuse about him as a handsome, friendly man of the people who gets things done.\u0026nbspFuel was so scarce in the 1990s that he cycled to work wearing shorts instead of commuting by Soviet-made Lada like other party leaders, locals said. He has also been lauded for backing the Santa Clara culture centre at a time when homophobia was commonplace in the party.\u0026nbspA music lover, Díaz-Canel would reportedly bring his two children from his first marriage to the centre\u0027s youth events, dancing there himself in the evenings. ReutersCastro said he expected Díaz-Canel to serve two five-year terms as president before replacing him as first secretary of the party when he retires in 2021. “From that point on, I will be just another soldier defending this revolution,” Castro said.Amid the anachronistic language, there were signs that the new president was trying to forge a more modern image for the island’s ruling Communist party.  In what appeared to be a centrally managed information operation, the hashtag #somoscontinuidad (#wearecontinuity) was trending on Twitter.Internet access has expanded rapidly in recent years, but still remains below the regional average. All major international news websites can be accessed from the island, but government censors block critical blogs as well as webpages financed by the US state department.Communist party insiders say Díaz-Canel is aware of the economic benefits that wider internet access could bring the island’s economy, but fears the island’s political system could be overwhelmed.Under the Obama administration, USAid worked on developing a “Cuban twitter” aimed at fomenting unrest, and in January the US state department launched a Cuba Internet Task Force, which Havana sees as another attempt to undermine it.Díaz-Canel assumes office at a tricky time for the island after the Trump administration partially reversed the fragile détente announced by Castro and Barack Obama in 2014.The US has said Cuba was “responsible” for a series of mysterious health ailments affecting US embassy personnel on the island and has withdrawn more than half of its diplomatic staff. Washington has also warned US citizens not to visit the island – a move which is starting to choke off tourism revenues.Cuba’s main ally, Venezuela, is in crisis, and has heavily cut back on highly subsidized oil shipments to Cuba, upon which the island is heavily reliant.One of Díaz-Canel’s first tasks as president will be to unify the island’s byzantine dual-currency system. Analysts say that if not managed correctly, unification could provoke inflation which could hit the purchasing power of poorer Cubans who form the base of the government’s support. Unlike the carefully orchestrated election, currency unification has the potential to unsettle the island’s seemingly rock-solid political stability.Cubans were ided about the new president. “It’s not good news for me,” said Liliam Rodríguez, 33, who works as a tour guide. “He’s looks like he’s against the private sector in recent speeches.”“I don’t see him as a president,” Gerardo Cartalla, 56, a taxi driver. “In the current situation, I’d have liked Raúl to stay on as president. He’s somebody everybody respects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a00879b0b0fdd2953922b81e494cd685f5284a/0_57_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b67d1a91c16e5705a0ec15333aa47384 1240w","title":"north korea wants complete denuclearisation says seoul","story":"South Korea’s president says Pyongyang has not attached any conditions such as US troop withdrawalNorth Korea has expressed a desire for the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula without attaching preconditions such as the withdrawal of US troops, the South Korean president has said.The statement, unconfirmed by North Korea, comes before a summit between the leaders of the two countries on 27 April, to be followed in May or June by a meeting between Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and Donald Trump.The US president on Wednesday pledged to meet Kim “in the coming weeks” but said he was prepared to walk away if the talks were not fruitful.The key question at any summit between Trump and Kim is whether the North Korean leader is serious about dismantling his regime’s nuclear weapons, and what he would demand from the US in return.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, told reporters that North Korea had not “attached any conditions that the US cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. All they are expressing is the end of hostile policies against North Korea, followed by a guarantee of security.”Robert Wood, the top US envoy to the UN-hosted conference on disarmament, said the country would maintain a “maximum pressure campaign” to convince North Korea to denuclearise, even as preparations for the summit continued, adding that it “has had an important impact in the North’s decision to return to the table”.At a news conference on Thursday, before a meeting next week on nuclear nonproliferation, Wood said the US welcomed Pyongyang’s willingness to talk about denuclearisation, and called the summit planned for late May or early June a “momentous time”.Meanwhile, the European Union imposed travel bans and asset freezes on four people suspected of “deceptive financial practices” to benefit North Korea’s arms programme. The EU did not name the four, but said they brought the number of people on its North Korea blacklist to 59, as well as nine entities. It has also mirrored the UN’s sanctions list, which covers 80 people and 75 entities.The anti-nuclear weapons group that won last year’s Nobel peace prize has said it is “very supportive” of the proposed summit, after months of heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.The executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said mutual threats between the two leaders had made the risk of nuclear confrontation “really dangerously high”. Speaking to reporters, Beatrice Fihn said if the summit in late May or early June made progress on disarmament, “we’ll definitely applaud it … Every step forward is positive.”There has never been a summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, though Bill Clinton came close to agreeing to meet Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2000.“As you know, I will be meeting with Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” the US president told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Wednesday. “Hopefully, that meeting will be a great success and we’re looking forward to it.”North Korea has defended its weapons programmes, which it pursues in defiance of UN security council resolutions, as a necessary deterrent against perceived US hostility. There are 28,500 American troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war.North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the US removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear deterrence umbrella from South Korea and Japan.The North may have found a way to make a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile, but firing one at the South is likely to provoke retaliation in kind, which would end the regime.\u0026nbspPyongyang has enough conventional artillery to do significant damage to Seoul, but the quality of its gunners and munitions is dubious, and the same problem – retaliation from the South and its allies - remains.In the event of a non-nuclear attack, Seoul\u0027s residents would act on years of experience of civil defence drills, and rush to the bomb shelters dotted around the city, increasing their chances of survival.South Korea announced on Wednesday that it was considering how to convert a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a full peace agreement. Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Trump confirmed this week that the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, had travelled to North Korea to meet Kim, paving the way for Trump to hold the summit.The mission, which came shortly after Pompeo was nominated as secretary of state, was the highest-level meeting between the two countries since 2000, when Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang. It also marked the first time Kim Jong-un had met a senior western official."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88036b522f1b007ab53525058adb10ffa1a819ca/341_724_3785_2272/master/3785.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=347b94b1956f564bf8962c23a8fdc899 1240w","title":"china accidentally reports two major quakes never happened","story":"Authorities report two 6.5-magnitude quakes at opposite ends of country that were in fact drills Chinese authorities have admitted accidentally reporting two major earthquakes that had never happened but were instead drills unintentionally released to the public. Late on Thursday, China’s earthquake administration said on its website there had been two 6.5-magnitude quakes just 10 seconds apart at opposite ends of the country – in the far-western region of Xinjiang and the south-western province of Yunnan.The information stayed on the administration’s website for at least an hour, though did not appear on its microblog, which is how many people in China first learn of quakes.On Friday, in a statement on its website, the administration said it had in fact been holding an emergency response exercise. “An accidental leak of the quake drill was picked up by the media and caused a misunderstanding,” it said. “After this happened, our administration immediately organised relevant departments to delete the inaccurate information.” China is a seismically active country frequently hit by major earthquakes. In May 2008, a 7.9-magnitude quake rocked the south-western province of Sichuan, killing almost 90,000 people.

Scientists exploring the Borneo jungle have just discovered the species, which dwells in the trees, and they were most intrigued by the ant’s unique ability – to explode and shower toxic yellow goo on to its enemies.Yet as impressive and effective as the detonation is in killing its predators, it is ultimately a suicide defence, for it also explodes the ant’s whole body which ultimately leads to its own demise.Exploding ants are a rarity and the Colobopsis explodens ant is the first new species to be found since 1935, with the finding published in the journal Zookeys.The small, reddish ant was discovered living in the treetops of Borneo by a team including Alice Laciny, an entomologist with the Natural History Museum in Vienna, who described how the ants would detonate themselves to save other members of the colony. When faced with an enemy that will not back down, the Colobopsis explodens will latch onto the insect and bite down on it, angle their backsides directly at their attacker and then flex their abdomens so hard they tear their own bodies apart, releasing the fatal yellow substance stored inside. Laciny described the bright goo as having “a distinct and not unpleasant smell that’s strangely reminiscent of curry”.The ability to explode however, is not something all the ants in this species have. It is only the minor workers, all sterile females, who will sacrifice their lives by exploding in order to protect the bigger members of the colony. They were found to be “particularly prone to self-sacrifice” as a defence and would even detonate when the intruding researchers approached.This suicidal tendency, which is similar to that of a bee delivering a sting when threatened, is called autothysis, and is common in superorganisms like ants, who work as a collective and where the needs of the group are more important than the inidual in a colony.

Two of them were given to the Queen and Prince Philip on their 1954 tour of New Zealand, and were later worn by other members of the royal family when they visited the country.According to Te Papa, in the Māori world birds were given the task of carrying spiritual messages between the gods and people, and their feathers were prized and sacred.Ardern’s Kahu huruhuru has been loaned to her from the London Māori club Ngāti Rānana.Modern-day Kahu huruhuru are often made from the feathers of birds killed by predators or on motorways, because many native New Zealand birds such as the Kereru and Pukeko are endangered and protected species.

The site was created at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War as a meeting point to discuss the uneasy truce that ended the conflict.\u0026nbspThere are six buildings that straddle the border, three of which are painted United Nations blue, where talks between the two sides occasionally take place. It is also a major tourist destination and visitors can technically cross into North Korea inside the buildings. Outside, there is a raised concrete curb that marks the border. \u0026nbspBefore two American soldiers were killed in 1976, the entire area was neutral and personnel from the North and South move freely throughout the zone. Since the murders a hard border bisecting the area has been enforced. In 2017, it was the sight of a dramatic escape by a North Korean soldier who was shot while fleeing to the South.North Korea has not commented on Moon’s claim on Thursday that Kim would not demand the withdrawal of US troops from the Korean peninsula as a precondition for abandoning his nuclear weapons during his meeting with Donald Trump in late May or early June.“North Korea is expressing a commitment to a complete denuclearisation,” Moon, a left-leaning liberal who has long favoured engagement with the North, told media executives. “They are not presenting a condition that the US cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of the American troops in South Korea ... North Korea is only talking about the end of a hostile policy against it and then a security guarantee for the country.”North Korea could offer some indication of what it expects in return for denuclearisation later on Friday at a plenary session of the central committee of the ruling workers’ party.The state-run KCNA news agency said the committee would discuss “policy issues of a new stage” in response to the current “important historic period”.Some analysts speculated the body would revise Kim’s dual “byongjin” policy of pursuing economic and nuclear development before his summits with Moon and Trump.“There is a high possibility that North Korea could unveil a new policy line, revising its byongjin policy at the plenary session,” Cheong Seong-chang, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, told Yonhap. “A new line will likely contain North Korea expressing its willingness to join denuclearisation talks and resolve to improve ties with the South, the US and Japan, as well as to seek peace and coexistence.”Kim’s apparent concession on US troop withdrawal has taken many by surprise. Traditionally, North Korea has justified its nuclear programme as a necessary counter to Washington’s “hostile policy” of basing tens of thousands of troops in South Korea and Japan, and guaranteeing its north-east Asian allies’ security through its nuclear umbrella.With just a week to go before Kim and Moon become the first North and South Korean leaders to meet in more than a decade, officials were trying to ensure the summit would proceed without incident or embarrassment.Earlier this week they met to discuss details, including plans to broadcast live TV coverage of the leaders’ shaking hands at the start of their talks, which will take place at the Peace House on the southern side of the border village of Panmunjom.It will be the first time a North Korean leader has visited the South since the end of the Korean war, and only the third time any South or North Korean leaders have met.The two previous inter-Korea summits, held in 2000 and 2007 in Pyongyang, involved the then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun.Moon and Kim are expected to discuss a formal end to hostilities between their countries, 65 years after the Korean war ended with an armistice, but not a peace treaty.Trump told reporters this week the Koreas “have my blessing” to secure a peace treaty and bring an end to the conflict.Six senior South Korean officials will accompany Moon to the summit, including his chief of staff, spy chief, national security adviser and unification, defence and foreign ministers, a presidential spokesman said.

US giant AMC has been granted the first licence to operate movie theatres.The AMC chief executive, Adam Aron, said ticket sales will start on Thursday for the first public shows on Friday, but local authorities indicated the test screenings could last for days. Officials earlier said movie theatres are expected to open to the public in May.“This is a historic day for AMC. This is a historic day for your country,” Aron told an audience of government officials and industry figures. “Welcome to the era when movies can be watched by Saudis not in Bahrain, not in Dubai, not in London ... but inside the kingdom.”Religious hardliners, who have long vilified movie theatres as vulgar and sinful, were instrumental in shutting them down in the 1980s.The move to reopen cinemas is part of a modernisation drive by the reformist crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is seeking to balance unpopular subsidy cuts in an era of low oil prices with more entertainment options, despite opposition from hardliners. Black Panther, a film about a young monarch of a fictional African jungle kingdom, has drawn parallels with the Saudi prince.International theatre chains have long eyed the kingdom as the Middle East’s last untapped mass market – the majority of Saudi Arabia’s 30 million people are under 25.AMC Entertainment signed a non-binding agreement in December to build and operate cinemas across the kingdom.Saudi state media has said the company expects to open 40 cinemas in 15 cities over the next five years, but AMC will still face stiff competition from other heavyweights, including Dubai-based VOX Cinemas, the leading operator in the Middle East.Similar to television programming, movies are likely to face some censorship in the kingdom, where sex, religion and politics are widely seen as taboo subjects.Long known for its ultra-conservative mores, the kingdom has embarked on a wide-ranging programme of social reforms that includes mixed-gender concerts and a historic decree allowing women to drive from June."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dublin Port will press ahead with plans to build \u0026lsquonecessary customs posts\u0026rsquo at the capital\u0026rsquos busy shipping dock15-year-old \u0026lsquogot in way over his head\u0026rsquo and had been under an \u0026lsquoimplied threat\u0026rsquoIoan Artene Bob (49) was found seriously injured last Friday morning and later diedStrong backing for removing constitutional ban on abortion but fifth of voters undecidedIctu finds TUI did not act in line with rules in accepting 1,070 teachers as new membersSinn F\u0026eacutein support likely to depend on introduction of sentencing guidelines for judgesSinn F\u0026eacutein launches party campaign in favour of repeal ahead of the May \u0026lsquodate with destiny\u0026rsquoMinister rejects responsibility for how Eoghan \u0026Oacute Neachtain conversation may have been interpretedShoppers urged to hand back plastic packaging at checkouts during Saturday\u0026rsquos protestPrison Officers\u0026rsquo Association wants sanctions and loss of remission used to impose orderNolan\u0026rsquos in Clontarf commits to eliminating unnecessary wrapping and packagingOfficials vacate roles pending outcome of inquiry into handling of rape allegationPlan subjected to \u0026lsquosystematic and forensic annihilation\u0026rsquo by Brussels\u0026lsquoLimerick Voice\u0026rsquo honoured at awards ceremony, popularly known as the \u0026lsquoSmedias\u0026rsquoAbout 70 pupils face sitting three exams in a single day due to timetable congestionMany worry about the cost of visiting a GP and paying for antibiotics \u0026ndash new reportMagazine says Taoiseach an example of how much Ireland has changed in last 25 yearsGarda\u0026iacute ask anyone who witnessed crash on Sleaveen Road in Macroom to come forwardNorthern Ireland Ambulance Service says no patients were taken from crash sceneGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses to fatal road accident outside MacroomThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3467315.1524180249!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"four senior scouting ireland figures step aside","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief scout at Scouting Ireland Christy McCann: along with David Shalloo, chief commissioner for youth affairs, he is “temporarily” standing down.Four senior Scouting Ireland figures have stepped aside from their positions while an independent inquiry is completed into how senior volunteers in the organisation handled a rape allegation in 2016. Minister for Children Katherine Zappone has received several “grave and serious” confidential disclosures about Scouting Ireland since revelations in The Irish Times of the organisation’s flawed handling of the 2016 allegation. Chief scout Christy McCann announced on Thursday he had informed the organisation’s board that he was “temporarily” standing down.David Shalloo, chief commissioner for youth affairs, said on Thursday night he would “temporarily step aside” from his role, pending the investigation’s conclusion. Thérèse Bermingham, chief commissioner for adult resources, and board member Ollie Kehoe also decided to step aside last night, pending the inquiry’s completion.A barrister-led investigation is looking at the actions of Mr McCann, Mr Shalloo, Ms Bermingham and Mr Kehoe in handling the rape allegation. A confidential review by child protection expert Ian Elliott, into the treatment of the 2016 complaint, in which a female leader claimed she was raped by a male leader on a camping trip seven years earlier, criticised the actions of the four senior volunteers. The male leader was readmitted to Scouting Ireland after the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute. However, Garda advice to resubmit the man for Garda vetting was not followed. The barrister-led inquiry is expected to be completed next month, at which point the board may consider disciplinary action.In a statement to the organisation’s membership, Mr McCann said: “I believe it is in the best interests of our organisation” to step down “to give adequate time to bring our investigation to a conclusion.“As chief scout and as a co-respondent in the process currently under way, I believe my standing-aside is the right thing to do and will help ensure the current process is allowed to continue without delay and further distraction.” Mr Shalloo criticised the Elliott report, stating he had concerns with “the manner in which the review was carried out and the fundamental inaccuracies and the flaws contained therein”. He said a number of its findings were “wholly unsubstantiated and misdirected”.In a statement to members he said, “I can say without hesitation or imprudence, that my moral compass has remained properly aligned at all times.” He added it was difficult to witness the organisation “sustain a reputational hammering”.Ms Zappone held a meeting with Scouting Ireland chief executive Dr John Lawlor and Mr McCann on Thursday evening at her department’s offices. Speaking afterwards, she said there was an “enormous job that has to be completed” to provide assurances over the body’s governance. Last week, Ms Zappone suspended State funding to the organisation, worth nearly €1 million a year, due to governance concerns over the board’s response to Mr Elliott’s report. Publicly funded organisations must be required to meet “strong governance standards”, Ms Zappone told the Dáil on Thursday.“In view of this I decided to withhold any further drawdown of funding to Scouting Ireland until such time as I can be satisfied that the organisation’s governance standards are up to the required level. As of now I am not satisfied.” So far this year, the organisation, which has 40,000 juvenile members, has drawn down €438,168 in State funding. “This means that Scouting Ireland is funded up until the end of June,” the Minister said. “It is my sincere hope that Scouting Ireland will utilise this time to engage constructively with myself and my officials, to address all outstanding issues relating to the standards of governance within the organisation.” The Scouting Ireland board held an emergency meeting on Wednesday night which lasted more than four hours.

Video: Margo O\u0027Donnell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBig Tom at the funeral of Irish country singer Larry Cunningham in Co. Longford in 2012. Photographer: Dara Mac DónaillTHE IRISH TIMES Nobody could fill a hall at the height of the showband era like the late Big Tom McBride. Long queues would form outside the local ballroom when Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, came to town. Generally, dancing was 9pm to 1am, with a relief band getting proceedings underway.In the 1960s, as Ireland was slowly changing, the ballrooms replaced as dance venues the parish halls, which had been frequently run by the local parish priest, whose task sometimes was to guard against the perils of close dancing.Not so the ballrooms, where close dancing ceased to be a moral threat.Many of the ballrooms were exotic, by comparison, and they introduced an element of glamour in a grey Ireland. Their opening saw the emergence of the showbands, vocally more sophisticated than the parish hall band, with the singers and musicians sporting bright suits and modern hairstyles. Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, became the country stars of that new world. When he recorded the sentimental Gentle Mother in 1967, it became an instant hit, reaching the coveted number one spot in RTÉ Radio’s top 10 records.An overnight success, he went on to enjoy a huge following at home and among Irish emigrants.Yet the showband business was run on an informal basis, with mainly cash transactions.In the midlands, a young businessman, Albert Reynolds, later to become Taoiseach, opened a series of ballrooms. He was later spoken of as a good promoter the band was always paid and a hot meal provided before going on stage. In Tralee, Co Kerry, a ballroom attached to the Mount Brandon hotel, opened by then Taoiseach Sean Lemass in the 1960s, was a hugely successful venue for Big Tom. It had a chandelier and a large balcony. Like the other ballrooms, though, it sold nothing stronger than soft drinks.The women queued on one side of the hall and the men on the other. If there was a large crowd, there was a rush to ask a woman to dance. This was the entertainment world dominated by Big Tom, Dickie Rock, Brendan Bowyer, Brendan O’Brien and Philomena Begley in the sixties and seventies.With the exception perhaps of Bowyer, nobody rivalled Big Tom as a crowd-puller. His country audience followed him faithfully, sometimes driving miles to see him play, not least in the summer when the venue could be a marquee in a country village where the local carnival was being held. He understood his audience. He came from Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and knew rural Ireland. He had spent some time as an emigrant in London. His songs were about love affairs, many of them ending in remorse and melancholy, old Irish ballads, and some modern songs. Despite being the lead singer and playing the guitar in the band, he was intensely uneasy with fame.I interviewed him many years ago when he was playing at the Festival of Kerry at the height of his fame.He was a courteous, diffident, shy man. He told me he found public recognition difficult.He had just turned down his own series on RTÉ television at the time because the station wanted to use professional session musicians rather than his own band members, all of whom hailed from his native Monaghan.“They would be the best in the business,’’ he said. “But they would have no interest in country music.’’Big Tom and his music were lampooned, of course. In an Ireland struggling for sophistication, having watched too much television, Big Tom and his likes were not cool.His country fans dismissed the lampooning, followed him in the dancehalls and bought his records in abundanceIn recent times, he would get due recognition on a country music special on The Late Late Show, presented by Ryan Tubridy, who helped the visibly ailing Big Tom to the microphone to sing his trademark Four Country Roads. Some 400,00 people emigrated from Ireland between 1951 and 1961 alone, most of them poorly educated and ill-prepared. Many headed for British building sites and factories. “They were a silent generation,’’ the novelist John McGahern later wrote,”and they left in silence.’’They followed Big Tom when he came to London to play in the then thriving Irish dancehalls, such as the Galtymore in Cricklewood, the National in Kilburn, and the Gresham in Holloway Road. They played his records at home and sang his songs at Irish emigrant gatherings, the poignancy of his voice in harmony with the bitter-sweet experience of forced emigration.It is very easy today to dismiss all this as crass sentimentality. It would be wrong, because it was no such thing.Big Tom’s songs and music were a lifeline for a dispossessed people, forced out of their own country, which could not even provide them with the basic human right of a job. Many of those songs were melancholic. But our history of forced emigration is laced with melancholy.A good friend, John Mulrooney, from Sligo, was a close friend of Big Tom. Some years ago, we said we would meet up at one of his concerts. We never did.I regret that now.The Ireland which made Big Tom a country star is gone. The ballrooms have long closed and the showbands are no more.

Both of which were shot down by the EU, according to the report. Photograph: PA The European Union has rejected British proposals for avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland according to the Daily Telegraph.British prime minister Theresa May’s plan for avoiding a hard border was subjected to “a systematic and forensic annihilation” this week, the paper has reported.“It was a detailed and forensic rebuttal. It was made clear that none of the UK’s customs options will work,” a source told the paper.Last month, Ms May said remaining in the EU customs union would “not be compatible with meaningful independent trade policy” and proposed two options for avoiding a hard border while retaining the ability to set tariffs.Ms May has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, instead proposing two alternative models.The first, a “customs partnership” would see Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the country en route to Europe and applying its own tariffs to imported goods destined for the British market.The Telegraph reports that this was rejected by the EU on three grounds – that the EU could not allow a country outside its supervision mechanisms and IT systems to ley duties and that it unfairly placed the burden of collecting tariffs on business.It was also rejected as implementing the scheme on the EU side of the channel would be too expensive.The second, a “customs arrangement”, envisages technological and administrative measures ensuring that trade with the EU remains frictionless, with additional measures for Northern Ireland such as allowing small traders to operate across the Border unchecked.This too was rejected by EU states who are said concerned about setting precedents for ‘turning a blind eye’ with countries like Turkey, while it was pointed out that other ideas like having authorised economic operators fell short of what was needed to avoid a border.At a briefing in Brussels last week, one ambassador put up his hand and asked if anyone could tell him how to open an export-import business in Ireland, “because it is going to be a great business if there are no customs controls”, according to an account obtained by the Telegraph.A powerful cross-party group of MPs are set to force a vote in the House of Commons next week calling on Ms May’s government to seek to remain in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland.The motion, which has been tabled by 10 select committee chairmen including Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, will be debated next Thursday.A vote on the motion will be non-binding but the debate will increase pressure on the British government to keep the customs union option alive following a massive defeat on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The motion notes the importance of frictionless trade with the EU for British manufacturing and “further notes that the free circulation of goods on the island of Ireland is a consequence of the UK and Republic of Ireland’s membership of the EU customs union”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3467508.1524160246!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps call on may to seek to remain in customs union with eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: The prime minister has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit. Photograph:  Jack Taylor Getty Images A powerful cross-party group of MPs are set to force a vote in the House of Commons next week calling on Theresa May’s government to seek to remain in a customs union with the European Union in order to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The motion, which has been tabled by 10 select committee chairs including Conservatives Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, will be debated next Thursday.A vote on the motion will be non-binding but the debate will increase pressure on the government to keep the customs union option alive following a massive defeat on the issue in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The motion notes the importance of frictionless trade with the EU for British manufactures and “further notes that the free circulation of goods on the island of Ireland is a consequence of the UK and Republic of Ireland’s membership of the EU customs union”.It recalls the British government’s commitment in last December’s joint report with the EU “to the maintenance of North-South cooperation and the all-island economy on the island of Ireland, that the Belfast Agreement implemented in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 should remain a fundamental principle of public policy, and to the continuation of unfettered access for Northern Ireland’s businesses to the whole of the United Kingdom internal market”.In a joint article for HuffPost on Thursday, Ms Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper said MPs had a responsibility to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland and the role of the all-island economy in strengthening the peace.“Ministers have rightly insisted both that there cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, or between Northern Ireland and Britain either.” But as the Northern Ireland Committee concluded last month, there are no technical solutions, anywhere in the world, “beyond the aspirational”, that would remove the need for physical infrastructure at the border. The police have warned that even customs cameras to check number plates at the border may become a security target for dissident groups,” they said.The prime minister has ruled out remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, instead proposing two alternative models. The first, a “customs partnership” would see Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the country en route to Europe and applying its own tariffs to imported goods destined for the British market.The second, a “customs arrangement”, envisages technological and administrative measures ensuring that trade with the EU remains frictionless, with additional measures for Northern Ireland such as allowing small traders to operate across the Border unchecked.There is some tension within the government between advocates of either model, with eurosceptics fearing that a customs partnership could lead to a customs union in all but name.Next week’s vote comes ahead of amendments to a trade bill and a customs bill calling for Britain to remain in a customs union with the EU and will offer an indication of how many Conservatives are willing to break ranks on the issue.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

I think the idea of people coming to us on our terms - those days are probably gone.\u0026quotI want to reach more people, and more people live in urban areas. It\u0027s got to be radical. But rather than change it I want to add to it.\u0026quotThe greatest National Trust properties – according to the expertsMs McGrady also tackled what she called the \u0026quotwicked\u0026quot issue of hunting, and reassured members that there would be no ban on hunting. \u0026quotIt\u0027s not going to solve itself,\u0026quot she said. \u0026quotTrail hunting is a legal thing to do, the trust has introduced much more robust licence this year and we\u0027ll make sure those licences are followed.\u0026quotThe move comes a month after the National Trust was criticised by a former charities minister for handing its staff an inflation busting-pay rise – weeks after justifying a large hike in membership fees for millions of members by saying the extra money will be spent on conservation.National Trust workers voted to accept a 4.5 per cent pay offer, described by Prospect, their union, as a \u0026quotground-breaking\u0026quot deal.Prospect said it had also agreed to hold further talks about creating a comprehensive \u0026quotwell-being strategy\u0026quot for the Trust\u0027s staff. It emerged some 8,270 Trust staff would get a pay rise of up 4.5 per cent.The news came just weeks after the National Trust announced that it would increase fees for its six million members from March 1 by as much as 6.5 per cent, more than twice inflation of 2.5 per cent.At the time of the announcement in January, the Trust issued a long statement justifying the increase by saying it would help to fund its biggest ever programme of conservation repairs, maintenance and improvements. No mention was made of the pay talks.Rob Wilson, a former Tory MP who was Charities minister from 2014 to 2017, said the Trust should have been upfront about the salary talks so members could decide whether to renew.He told The Daily Telegraph: “The reputation of charities is going through a pretty torrid time at the moment, so it is essential they are as transparent as possible to maintain the trust of the public. “When making increases in membership fees, it would be sensible for the sake of openness for the National Trust to declare all significant new costs that are relevant to the rise. How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsCarl Fogarty: \u0026#39Ant McPartlin doesn\u0026#39t need rehab – he needs to man up\u0026#39Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsFirst look at Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Suits wedding as episode trailer is releasedChingford fire: Woman dies as flames engulf London care home for adults with learning difficulties Salisbury spy attack: Toxic nerve agent \u0026#39hotspots\u0026#39 could still be in the city, Government warnsThe \u0026#39true\u0026#39 horror of Heol Fanog: what really happened at the Welsh Amityville?New Globe director: The future of Shakespeare is femaleThe Royal Academy at 250: Inside the £56 million makeover for art\u0026#39s most \u0026#39establishment\u0026#39 yet eccentric institutionUS sorghum armada U-turns at sea after China\u0026#39s latest tariff salvo in brewing trade warUK weather: Britain set to sizzle again after hottest April day for 70 yearsNorth Korea’s nuclear reactor puts 100 million people in ‘mortal danger’ amid fears of Asian Chernobyl James Comey\u0026#39s memos: Donald Trump told by Putin that Russia had \u0026#39most beautiful hookers\u0026#39North Korea drops demand for US troop withdrawal from South in boost for talksWindrush Generation: \u0026#39They thought we should be planting bananas\u0026#39Pittsburgh police brace for violence if Donald Trump fires Robert MuellerJuror jailed for taking bribe during £7m cocaine dealing trialQueen publicly backs Prince Charles as future head of Commonwealth - and begins \u0026#39winding down\u0026#39 her dutiesWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather britain set sizzle hottest april day 70 years","story":"Britons are set for another scorcher as April\u0027s summer-like weather promises a balmy beginning to the weekend.Thursday was the hottest April day for nearly 70 years, with the mercury soaring to 29.1C (84F) in St James\u0027 Park in London.Friday\u0027s highs are likely to be around 28C (82F) in the South East, the Met Office said, with most parts enjoying warmer conditions than normal for the time of year.\u0026quotIt\u0027s going to be pretty hot again tomorrow, with a lot of sunshine around,\u0026quot said meteorologist Alex Burkill.\u0026quotWe will see highs of 26C, 27C and maybe 28C in the London area.

We’re also thrilled to introduce Daisy to the world, as she represents what’s possible when innovation and conservation meet.”The Daisy robot is actually a more advanced version of Liam, the robot first announced in 2016. The new version, named Daisy, incorporates some of the same parts and technology that were made for its predecessor.It can take apart 200 iPhones per hour. After doing so, it takes out the components and sorts them.Apple will also offer a special Watch achievement to people who do a 30 minute workout on Earth Day. And Apple stores around the world will feature logos with green leaves or window decals in celebration of the day.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.The Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripThe population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.As well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.This is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Understanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Guy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. Outgoing Cuban President Raul Castro  raising the arm of Cuba\u0027s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel after he was formally named by the National Assembly, in Havana.

But, it is still too soon to determine what went wrong, NTSB Chairman Robert Zumwalt said Wednesday.“I know people would want answers right away. We would do a very methodical investigation,” Mr Sumwalt told reporters. “Right now, we just want to document everything that we can.”The NTSB is looking into whether a crack on the inside of a fan blade could have caused the engine to fail. The crack, according to Mr Sumwalt, was “certanily not detectable from looking at it from the outside.”Investigators have determined that one of the cracks on the blade was consistent with metal fatigue, and that the blade itself had broken twice in total — nearly halfway through the piece, and again the blade was attached to the hub.Southwest Airlines has said that workers had performed a visual inspection of the engine that failed, and that an X-ray and ultrasonic inspection was scheduled for December. The X-ray and ultrasonic inspections help inspectors to see the cracks that are harder for the human eye to detect.Jennifer Riordan died after being partially sucked out of a shattered plane window following an engine explosion.Tammie Jo Shults, hero pilot of Southwest 1380, kept calm and saved her passengers.Marty Martinez, left, appears with other passengers after a jet engine blew out on the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 plane.The window that was shattered after a jet engine of the Southwest Airlines airplane blew out at altitudeA National Transportation Safety Board investigator examines damage to the engine.The Southwest Airlines jet sits on the runway at Philadelphia International Airport after it was forced to land with an engine failure.Pennsylvania Game Commission employees recover a piece of the Southwest Airline engine covering that landed in Penn Township, Berks County.Tammie Jo Shults was hailed a hero by passengers.The window that was shattered.A National Transportation Safety Board investigator photographs a Southwest Airline engine covering that landed in Penn TownshipThe exploded engine of Southwest Airlines flight 1380 during the flight from a passenger\u0027s window.US Navy Lieutenant Tammie Jo Shults in front of a Navy FA-18A in 1992.Damage to the Southwest Airlines plane after Jennifer Riordan died when the jet blew an engine at 32,000ft.Emergency personnel monitor the damaged engine.The Federal Aviation Administration has said that it will issue a new directive to airlines that would require the more thorough inspections after a certain number of cycles, and that airlines will be asked to quickly perform the inspections on the type of engine that failed.The Southwest Airlines plane was forced to land in Philadelphia after the engine exploded at 32,000 feet, resulting in a loss of cabin pressure after pieces of shrapnel hit the cabin.

Others wrote “#Iambreakingthelaw”.Weibo, which is similar to Twitter in format, appeared to then ban the hashtags and deleted many of the 150,000-plus comments related to them.The company’s Nasdaq shares fell in value on Friday amid the controversy.In an update on Sunday, Weibo said the “clean-up” would “no longer target gay content”.Censors will “primarily focus on pornographic and violent material,” the social network said, adding: “Thank you everyone for your discussions and suggestions.” The company had previously said it was acting in accordance with China’s cybersecurity laws.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, has not commented.But the People’s Daily, the official paper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also appeared to criticise Weibo in an editorial on Sunday. “Intellectually speaking, there should be a consensus around respecting other people’s sexual orientation,” the column said, adding that comparing homosexuality to pornography and violence and regarding it as “abnormal” would go down badly with the public. Outgoing Cuban President Raul Castro  raising the arm of Cuba\u0027s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel after he was formally named by the National Assembly, in Havana.

However, a traditional, conservative preference for conventional marriage and childbearing creates barriers for LGBT+ people. Following Weibo’s initial announcement on Friday, more than a million users have viewed hashtags in support of LGBT+ rights.Hua Zile, the founder of Voice for China LGBT, Weibo’s first LGBT-themed account, said he was encouraged by the widespread anger over the site’s censorship plan. “The response shows that we LGBT people in China are slowly realising our rights,” Mr Hua said. “Gay people who would not have spoken out years ago are now letting their voices be heard.” He said a Weibo manager had told him to stop posting while the “clean-up” was taking place.He complied, and his announcement that Voice for China LGBT would be going on hiatus was shared nearly 40,000 times. After Weibo’s u-turn, Mr Hua called on the firm to apologise to the LGBT+ community. “Like China, which has developed so quickly in such a short time, sex education in the country is a work in progress,” he said. On Sunday, an LGBT+ group of more than 100 people took part in a marathon in the city of Nanjing, holding rainbow flags to raise awareness of gay rights.The group had planned to take part in the marathon months in advance, but its organiser, Lucas Chen, said Weibo’s announcement gave it “added significance”. The main objective of joining the marathon was to “help everyone courageously come out of the closet,” Mr Chen said. “So it was meaningful that people online were also bravely speaking out and showing that they were not defeated by negativity.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Tatton-Brown added: British patriotism has something of an image crisis. Each national flag is heavy with history, which can be problematic.It is interesting to see from our findings that Britons would feel more comfortable representing their nation during a sporting event than, say, a patron saint\u0027s holiday, as perhaps the context of sporting rivalries and team support smooths over the harder edges of patriotism.----------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Emmanuel-Macron-Theresa-May-and-Donald-Tusk-and-Jean-Claude-Juncker-948820.jpg","title":"EU upset over Britain France bond Anglo Franco relations","story":"The Anglo-Franco relationship appears to be stronger than ever after both Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron emphasised their commitment to tackle international security issues together at a Sandhurst summit in January.Since their face-to-face meeting in January, Mrs May has called on Mr Macron to back her in a series of strikes - including one on Syria\u0026rsquos chemical weapons stockpiles - and the expulsion of Russian spies from the UK following the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.A UK Government source told Politico: \u0026ldquoOne of the things Macron has always been very keen on since they had their first meeting was to focus the relationship on security and defence.\u0026ldquoSalisbury and Syria have given more substance to that \u0026mdash he has made it play out in practice.\u0026rdquoGettyThe UK and France have upset the European Union by forging a new alliance                 Syria attack: British, US and French forces rain down terror on Syria                Calls for French to replace English after Brexit MOCKED by French CEOBritish Government officials believe that the partnership with France is good amidst Brexit negotiations, as it shows that the two nations will continue to share security and military details after March 2019.However, some in the EU, are not pleased at the friendship, as they want to \u0026ldquopunish\u0026rdquo Britain for leaving and think it\u0026rsquos only right the UK is left out in the cold after leaving the EU.Last year, Brexit Secretary David Davis urged the European Union not to punish the UK over the orce.He told The Andrew Marr show: \u0026ldquoWe cannot have a circumstance when the other side says they are going to punish you, so if that happens then there\u0027s a walk away and we have to plan for that.\u0026rdquoGettyThe Anglo-Franco relationship appears to be stronger than ever with Mrs May and Mr MacronMrs May, however, recently made the decision to join France and the US in launching airstrikes against Syria after Bashar al-Assad\u0027s Government was alleged to have carried out a chemical weapon attack which killed 70 people.She faced a chorus of disapproval from opposition MPs for not seeking parliamentary approval or a United Nations (UN) resolution for the air strikes.But she defended her decision not to recall Parliament, suggesting the \u0026ldquosecurity\u0026rdquo of the operation could have been compromised.She said: \u0026ldquoThe speed with which we acted was essential in co-operating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations.\u0026rdquoGettyMrs May might topple the budding romance between the French man and Donald TrumpHowever, while she did not inform her own MPs, she did manage to talk with Mr Macron twice ahead of the planned action.

blasted by one British-based campaign group who urged the EU not to allow Morocco to have the right to fish in waters adjacent to Western Sahara- as it\u0026rsquos a contested territory.Morocco controls most of Western Sahara and considers it part of its territory.It fought a 16-year war with the Polisario Front independence movement, which established the self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.GettyThe European Council could be set to rule on a controversial EU-Morocco fisheries deal                Brexit News: Fisheries fear shock industry WIPE OUT by 2020 The bloody war left at least 165,000 people homeless, and led to the sprawling Saharawi Refugee Camps to be set up in 1975-1976 to house refugees displaced by Morocco\u0027s occupation of Western Sahara.The leaders of the Polisario Front have wanted independence from Morocco for 40 years and frequently threaten to spark war.In 2016, the foreign minister of the Front\u0027s political wing, Mohamed Said Ould Salek, said it would not hesitate to strike Morocco.British based campaigners, Western Sahara Campaign UK, blasted EU officials for its plan to uphold the EU-Morocco fisheries deal and hand the area to Morocco - as it could reignite tensions in the region.On Monday, the EU Council, headed by Donald Tusk, authorised the European Commission to negotiate an amendment to the deal to include Western Sahara.The Polisario Front quickly condemned the move.GettyThe women fighters from the Polisario Front independence movement lay claim to Western SaharaA spokesman for the Polisario Front said: No guarantee announced in the negotiating mandate can ert attention from the fundamental illegality of this process.The Polisario Front and Western Sahara Campaign UK had believed that the fishising deal would not include the waters near Western Sahara after the European Union\u0027s highest court ruled on the dispute.In February, the European Court of Justice ruled that a EU-Morocco fisheries deal was invalid if applied to the waters of Western Sahara territory since this would be a breach of its population\u0027s rights.However, the United Nations said the region has a right to self-determination and campaigners have sought to challenge the EU\u0027s trade deals with Morocco in the courts because they include the desert region.GettyThe Saharawi Refugee Camps was set up after 1976 following Morocco\u0027s occupation of Western SaharaA spokesman for the EU Court of Justice said in a statement: \u0026ldquoThe Fisheries Agreement concluded between the EU and Morocco is valid in so far as it is not applicable to Western Sahara and to its adjacent waters.The ECJ added that because Western Sahara had been a contested region since Spain withdrew from it in 1975, \u0026ldquoit does not form part of the territory of the Kingdom of Morocco.\u0026rdquoTherefore, the region\u0027s adjacent waters were not part of the Moroccan fishing zone mentioned in the treaty with the EU, and the agreement could not be annulled because of it, the court said.Western Sahara Campaign UK said on its Twitter account that the ruling was \u0026ldquoa good day for Western Sahara.\u0026rdquoBut

But there are issues with EU law that we have to sort out.\u0026rdquoBut the secret laws come after Britain and the EU agreed on March 19 to a transition period of 21 months to give time for talks on future trade ties.The deal was supposed to ease concerns about a hard Brexit, but must still be approved by parliament in a vote expected later this year.Yet, as the EU makes its preparations, new figures show that the number of finance jobs to be shifted out of Britain or created overseas by March 2019 due to Brexit has dropped by half compared to six months ago to 5,000 roles.GettyThe new measures suggest the EU believes the UK will likely leave Europe with no deal despite talksFirms employing the bulk of UK-based workers in international finance told Reuters that the mass confusion predicted under \u0027project fear\u0027 had been exaggerated.Several banks said they had now significantly scaled back their estimates on a loss of staff to Europe.Deutsche Bank, which had originally planned to move up to 4,000 staff from London, will now shift less than 200 jobs.UBS plans to move 200 staff to Frankfurt from London after previously indicating as many as 1,500 jobs would move.Goldman Sachs, which had considered moving about 1,000 people, now expects to move fewer than 500.GettyA new poll suggests that banks will not move as much staff as first thought out of the UK to EuropeSome banks lowered the estimates for jobs they need to move as they consider more carefully how much of their operations they will need in the European Union if Britain loses access to the bloc\u0027s single market.The banks had been assured by British Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s Government and progress in talks with the EU.The findings suggest London will comfortably remain Europe\u0027s largest financial centre, at least in the short term.Peter Hahn, a professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking and Finance said: \u0026ldquoThe idea of London\u0027s demise was overdone because it will retain most of the advantages that made it a great financial centre.\u0026rdquo                            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/361027.jpg","title":"berlin bomb evacuation ww2 germany","story":"REUTERSCentral Berlin has been evacuatedBuildings were evactuated from 8am in an 800m (2,625ft) radius from where the bomb was found.The area includes government buildings, a hospital and the central railway station.Police say there is no immediate danger from the 1,100lb (500kg) British bomb which was found on Heidestrasse.It is believed the device will be defused around midday.A World War Two bomb has been defused near the central train station in Berlin, Germany.
