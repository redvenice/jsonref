First, nation states are far more effective in a crisis than unwieldy groupings of different countries.But the most bitter irony for Europe is that the one foreign politician our liberal commentariat have most mocked for years — Boris Johnson — is also the one who acted swiftly and decisively when it came to securing the vaccines. The number of doses you have speaks for itself.And it was the ‘sensible’ federalist Europeans who have failed so miserably.Anyone who still doubts the wisdom of Brexit needs only to look at the vaccine chaos unfolding across the Channel — and think again.Council leader \u0027appalled\u0027 at Covid vaccine appointments being missed in Notts -

citing safeguarding issues and staffing constraints.In contrast, others live-stream what is happening in the classroom with the children of keyworkers, including some interaction for youngsters at home.Others have a structured timetable and live lessons as well as pre-recorded video clips in between.A number of schools are reporting a higher turnout of eligible pupils on site - including children of critical workers and those classed as vulnerable - than in the March lockdown, prompting concerns about their ability to balance remote education with in-person teaching.It came as Education Secretary Gavin Williamson set out his expectations for schools during the latest lockdown.He said parents can contact Ofsted if they are unhappy with the offer and have previously raised concerns with their headteacher.Ms Longfield said: \u0027Every child has the right to a good education and it is not acceptable that some children are unable to learn, through no fault of their own, because of a lack of technology, or because their home circumstances prevent them being able to work effectively.\u0027There are also clearly disparities between what schools are offering children in terms of remote lessons.\u0027I want the Government to commit to ensuring that all children have access to technical equipment and broadband to support remote learning, alongside an urgent review of guidance for schools to ensure make sure that children receive a broad and balanced curriculum, whether at home or at school.\u0027As a minimum, those children learning remotely should have daily contact with teachers.\u0027We know the negative impact the last long lockdown had on the wellbeing of many children and I want to see a speeding-up of the process of introducing mental health support and counselling in every school.\u0027Mr Williamson told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the schools watchdog will enforce legal requirements for state schools in England to provide high-quality remote education during the lockdown.He said schools are expected to provide between three and five hours of teaching a day - and if parents feel their child is not receiving enough learning they should complain to the school first and then ultimately to Ofsted.The Department for Education said it expects schools to have a digital platform, such as G-Suite or Microsoft Education, and to provide at least some of their remote teaching via video lessons - this can be done by school-led videos or using other providers like Oak National Academy.Mr Williamson confirmed that children who do not have access to technology are seen as vulnerable and can attend school in person during the national lockdown.One thread on the Mumsnet website showed that parents are concerned about the disparities in learning.\u0027I\u0027m concerned about DD falling behind compared to the keyworker children in her class who are being taught by the teacher,\u0027 one parent wrote.Another said: \u0027There seems to be big disparities in what the offers are.\u0027One parent said they felt \u0027so disheartened\u0027 with the offer from their school, writing: \u0027I have a Year 6 who\u0027s had a maths worksheet and two bite-size clips to watch today.\u0027It\u0027s the same provision as the last lockdown.\u0027I\u0027m so disappointed I thought it would be better this time round.\u0027Then I read on here about other primary age children having live lessons and a more structured timetable and it makes me so disheartened.\u0027Another said: \u0027My Year 5 son is getting three 30-45 minute live lessons per day (his teacher working from home, with his children at home) plus the accompanying work, plus reading.\u0027And one parent said: \u0027Unfortunately we are just getting worksheets and links to bite-size.\u0027MailOnline reported on Tuesday how experts have warned of serious problems developing as England enters its third national lockdown, with one declaring \u0027The pandemic has created a mental health ticking time bomb\u0027.Draconian measures designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus variant will heavily impact many during the gruelling winter months.Depression, anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder are expected as the restrictions create a sense of terrible Deja Vu.The blow comes especially hard due to the proximity of New Year, where many had believed the start of 2021 would signal more optimistic fortunes.Michael Gove said the curbs on freedom would last for months, triggering more gloom among the public. And children - after being told schools would be safe - face difficult home-learning after the U-turn by Boris Johnson and his government.During his coronavirus news briefing today, the Prime Minister said approximately £12billion had been spent on NHS mental health care, with around another £19-20million contributed towards mental health charities.Emma Thomas, Chief Executive at YoungMinds told MailOnline: \u0027The pandemic is deepening the crisis in young people\u0027s mental health and there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the impact could be significant and long-term.\u0027Young people tell us that they\u0027ve struggled to cope with the changes and loss of coping mechanisms brought on by the pandemic, with many experiencing social isolation, anxiety, and fears around their future.\u0027Many lost access to mental health support during the first lockdown, while others chose not to look for help at a time when the NHS was under so much pressure. With the pandemic continuing through the winter and another lockdown confirmed, it\u0027s likely that more young people may struggle to cope.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/12/4D71320D00000578-5865013-image-a-11_1529494434938.jpg","title":"Democrats demand know rioters easily able storm Capitol","story":"Share this articleOne Capitol Police officer – his badge clearly visible – posed for a selfie with a rioter who smiled broadly as he took the image.

But Klopp said an addition “is just not likely” with no financial recovery from lockdown in sight.“If the world was in a completely normal place and we have this situation, you could be sure we would try everything to do the right thing now,” he said. “But the world is not in a normal place so I don’t know why we constantly treat a football club like it’s independent from all the other struggles around.“It is not a time for massive investment if you don’t have the funds for it. Obviously football clubs live off what they earn. We still don’t have supporters in the stadium, a lot of stuff is still different, and that has gone on for a long time.“So I don’t understand why people now talk about the situation like nothing happened. We are still in the middle of a pandemic so that’s not the best time we’ve ever had.Klopp insists Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owner, shares his desire to strengthen in central defence but should not jeopardise the club’s finances in the notoriously difficult January market.“In good times everybody thinks our owners are really generous and in bad times everyone thinks they are really tight, but they are not,” he said. “They are absolutely concerned about the club and the success of the club and understand how we have it.“They see exactly the same things I see about the necessity to sign players and things like this.“It is not that I say: ‘A centre-half would be really nice,’ and they say: ‘Wow, a centre-half? Really? Why?’ It’s all clear. It’s all on the table. We work on it, as you can imagine, but January is not the easiest transfer window and on top of that it is not having the money exactly as you want.”Klopp described the appointment of Dr Andreas Schlumberger as Liverpool’s head of recovery and performance as an important step in the treatment of injuries.“If you ask people in this area – rehab, performance, recovery – he is No 1 in Germany. I have known him for years. We studied at the same university and I followed his way all the way through.“We worked together for Dortmund for a few years. He went to Bayern, worked for Gladbach, worked for Schalke, Nuremberg, for the German FA and national team as well, so the CV is absolutely incredible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f35fbb5658f1f4405c4e6d2eed05136fd016d21e/0_0_7680_4608/master/7680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee19b82616f145d12b8715ef17fde6b0","title":"fa cup third round 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Boreham Wood, Marine and Stockport are hoping for romance but a shadow of uncertainty is hanging over the competitionChorley’s home tie against Derby always looked ripe for an upset and still does, albeit with the Championship side now in the role of underdogs against hosts from four isions below. An outbreak of Covid-19 means Wayne Rooney and his senior Derby players will be watching from home as a team of youngsters deputise in order to fulfil the fixture. A similar scenario may unfold on Friday evening with Aston Villa fielding youth players at home to Liverpool. Chorley’s chances of reaching the fourth round have hugely increased, but manager Jamie Vermiglio has been left deflated by the fixture’s reduction in status to little more than a box-ticking exercise. At least, unlike Southampton’s game against Shrewsbury, it’s still going ahead. At a time when the virus looks likely to wreak havoc on fixture lists in all four isions, there is little wriggle-room even without these added headaches. Whether or not Covid-hit games should be played this weekend is open to serious question, much like the wisdom of even attempting to carry on with this season’s FA Cup. BGIn recent times Boreham Wood have come within a whisker of unlikely promotion to the Football League, reaching the National League play-off final in 2017-18 and falling at the semi-final stage last July. An FA Cup third-round tie behind closed doors feels like meagre consolation but Luke Garrard’s side, who have already beaten EFL opposition this season in the form of Southend, have it in them to make life tough for Millwall. A face from FA Cup giant-killings past will be attempting to ensure they do: Matt Rhead was the hulking focal point of Lincoln’s attack when they reached the quarter-finals as a non-league side in 2017, leading the line in famous wins over Ipswich, Brighton and Burnley. Now 36, Rhead scored in the win at Canvey Island that took Boreham Wood into the third round for the first time. Rhead did not play professionally until he turned 28. Four years ago, his story was perfect for FA Cup romantics perhaps there is another chapter left to be written. NAYou do not need to speak to many people who have worked with Folarin Balogun to be convinced the forward has a huge future. Arsenal’s problem is it may not be with them, despite Mikel Arteta’s best intentions. Arteta said pointedly on Thursday he was “not sure” whether Balogun’s agent is committed to tying the 19-year-old down to a new contract. Clubs all over Europe would love to sign him when his current deal expires this summer, with some in the process of conducting extensive diligence. Balogun’s camp might contend he is yet to start a game for Arsenal and no clear route to a regular spot has been outlined. First-team appearances must be earned, of course, but Balogun has shown in his substitute cameos – which have brought two Europa League goals –he possesses the all-round attributes to make it at the top. Although Arteta will not want to tinker too much against Newcastle, an outing for Balogun might help convince the striker and his entourage that he is loved. NAManchester United’s pursuit of yet another competition they can exit in the semi-finals begins at home to Watford, whose still-new manager Xisco Muñoz continues a nightmare introductory run having taken on the Championship’s top two, Norwich and Swansea, so far. United have only lost in the third round three times since 1982, and won a major trophy anyway in each of those seasons. The last time they were knocked out of the FA Cup at their first hurdle and ended the season without silverware was 39 years ago, when the team that dumped them out was Watford. The Hornets’ 1-0 home win in 1982 could have been more emphatic, with United’s manager, Ron Atkinson, raging post-match that “Bryan Robson was a joke and Ray Wilkins was back to his worst old ways again” meaning that his team were “second best in every department”. Clearly not a believer in the modern managerial maxim of not criticising players in public, then. SBSam Allardyce returns to the first league club he managed, back when “Bloomfield Road was falling to bits and the training ground was an abomination”, as he wrote in his autobiography. In his second and final season at the club, Blackpool finished a point off automatic promotion to the second tier, inspired by Allardyce and a lucky mascot – a replica pig stolen from a hotel by the centre-back Andy Morrison. The Tangerines lost to Bradford in the play-off semi-finals and Allardyce was promptly sacked. Those are not the only unhappy memories that might be provoked by this game: Allardyce’s first experience of senior first-team coaching had come under Brian Talbot at West Brom, a job that ended precisely 30 years ago on Friday when Talbot was sacked after a humiliating FA Cup defeat to non-league Woking. SB Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20210107-53775-gnl.fw.20210107.ic.bell.mp3 Rodney Parade has been an extremely happy FA Cup hunting ground for Newport County in recent years, the scene of wins over Leicester, Leeds and Middlesbrough, as well as a stirring draw against Tottenham. Against what is likely to be a second-string Brighton side, Michael Flynn’s players ought to fancy their chances even without the backing of a raucous 7,850-strong crowd but might happily forego another upset if it helps them focus on winning promotion from League Two. Courting relegation from the Premier League, Brighton are also unlikely to be overly concerned with winning this game. The rather depressing upshot? A tie between two sides separated by 53 league places, which both would almost certainly be quite content to lose. BGFrank Lampard will be on a hiding to nothing when Morecambe visit. Defeat is unthinkable for Chelsea but whichever XI their manager selects, their performance needs to be on point. On the one hand, this presents the perfect opportunity to arrest a chastening run of four defeats from six games on the other there will be little glory in doing so. Lampard will be relieved if the occasion passes without the pressure on him ratcheting up. Morecambe, seventh in League Two, lost 7-0 at home to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup but have picked up considerably since then. Derek Adams’ side have not played since Boxing Day after a Covid-19 outbreak so bring an element of the unknown. Whether the Shrimps are refreshed or rusty, Lampard will require his players to be fighting fit. NAThe average Leeds league game this season has featured 3.71 goals, making them the most goal-friendly side in the top four isions. Away from home their games are running at 4.11 goals per game. Crawley’s average is a relatively sane 2.82, but they are yet to play a goalless game this season and are on an eight-match unbeaten run. The Red Devils have also already been involved in one of the most bizarre FA Cup games of this or any season. Away at Torquay in the first round, they were 2-0 down with seven minutes to play. It was 3-3 after 90 minutes, with three goals in the 22 minutes of stoppage time played after an injury to Crawley’s goalkeeper. The visitors then conceded two extra-time penalties, only to come back again with three goals in nine minutes to win 6-5. “These games come around once, maybe twice, in a lifetime and we just need to cherish it and hopefully get a good result,” says Ashley Nadesan, who scored the winner in that game. His manager, John Yems, is looking forward to this tie “150 million percent” – which is a lot, even in these days of rampant percentage inflation. SBAmong all these ill-timed third-round fixtures, nothing will be more jarring than the sight of Marine hosting Spurs in front of just a few interested onlookers. This should be everything the FA Cup is about, their tiny Rossett Park stadium rejoicing in a once-in-a-lifetime visit by José Mourinho and his players. Instead the occasion will be significantly diluted, although that has not stopped well-wishers from far and wide ensuring the eighth-tier outfit receive maximum benefit. Marine had sold 5,750 “virtual match tickets” to the game by Thursday evening, putting them 250 shy of their record attendance meanwhile, neighbours Liverpool and Everton both stepped in with offers of training facilities when their usual venue was made unavailable. Romance and feelgood factor remains even if they cannot all be present, the fans and staff to whom Marine mean so much can still take pride at their club’s place in the spotlight. NARobbie Savage conducted the third-round draw and was beside himself with delight as he earned all four non-league sides home ties against Premier League or Championship opposition. Stockport’s new owner, Mark Stott, has cleared the club’s debts and invested in a training ground and their Edgeley Park home, renewing optimism after 10 seasons in non-league. Playing West Ham behind closed doors is not a priority for a club harbouring serious notions of a return to the Football League. However, the fixture will remind those outside Greater Manchester that although Stockport remain in the shadow of far wealthier neighbours, they are at least still here.

But that is no reflection on the song itself, which is great, powered by a compellingly anthemic chorus.The album of the same name was a disappointment and probably New Order’s creative nadir. The music isn’t awful, just workmanlike and uninspired the lyrics, however, are frequently abysmal. But its title track – the only album title track New Order have recorded – shines, thanks to a beautiful melody and a yearning Bernard Sumner vocal.A baffling choice for a first single from Technique – largely instrumental, not much of a melody – Fine Time is still impossibly exciting: an urgent, clattering rhythm track, acid house squelches, sampled voices. Steve “Silk” Hurley’s remix turned it into streamlined, straightforward house music, but the idiosyncrasies of New Order’s approach to the genre are part of the appeal.New Order’s back catalogue isn’t big on acoustic ballads, but As It Is When It Was – an understated highlight of Brotherhood – is a beautiful example. A slightly rockier live version on the Pumped Full of Drugs video is worth checking out, not least for the insouciant cool of the guitarist and keyboard player Gillian Gilbert, who performs the whole thing with her back to the audience.Without wishing to be overspecific, it is the edited version of the 12in mix of Sub-Culture found on Substance that you need to hear. The Low-Life original is a bit limp, the full 12in a bit much, but the edit is perfect: the vocals polished so the tune shines, the whole thing kicked off with a thrilling burst of sampled drums.Years after this instrumental tribute to Curtis appeared on Low-Life, the band’s Stephen Morris told an interviewer that it had been edited down from a 17-minute original. When that finally appeared – on the 2002 box set Retro – it was revealed not as an indulgence, but a masterpiece: drifting, shifting and astonishingly beautiful, like nothing else in New Order’s oeuvre.It is fair to say that the last thing most people expected from the new, post-Hook iteration of New Order was their best album since Technique, but that is precisely what Music Complete was, as evinced by the guitar-heavy opener, Restless. It is more focused and potent than anything the band had done in decades.1Funky, but dark and agitated, Everything’s Gone Green was a transitional song, New Order exploring the dancefloor before they had fully escaped the shadow of their former band. Those interested in “what ifs” might suggest it is what Joy Division could have sounded like had they continued and absorbed the same influences from club music.The second single from Technique opened with a blast of house-influenced sampled orchestral stabs, but it is the opposite of Fine Time’s hectic chaos – the chorus is almost Abba-esque in its poppiness. Sumner’s voice drifts languidly over the backing, while Hook’s performance is a masterclass in how he reinvented the bass as a lead instrument, colouring rather than propelling the song.In the 80s, New Order had a habit of relegating songs that anyone else might have considered as singles to B-sides. Tucked away on the flip of Thieves Like Us, Lonesome Tonight is the perfect example: a sublime slice of melancholy with an instrumental coda that takes up half the track and is no less compelling than the song itself.“A redneck song”, according to Sumner Iron and Wine’s acoustic 2009 cover teases out the country influence at its centre, easy to miss when you are distracted by how exquisitely Hook’s bass coils around Sumner’s voice. Low-Life’s fabulous opening track, it also bears the lyrical influence of Jimmy Cliff’s 60s reggae hit Vietnam.The 00s was not a great decade for New Order: personal upheavals and tensions within the band led to their patchiest albums. But, occasionally, something clicked amid the turmoil, as on Crystal – a great song wrapped in a thrillingly noisy, echo-drenched reboot of New Order in guitar mode.Like the 1982 single Temptation, the opening track of Power, Corruption \u0026amp Lies sounds like a statement of intent: New Order truly becoming New Order after the hesitancy and mourning of their debut album. Age of Consent is a shimmering, if strange, pop song, driven by one of Hook’s greatest bass lines – hypnotic, relentless, insanely catchy.You wonder how New Order got through recording their debut single only months after Curtis’s death: both versions of the song predated his suicide, their lyrics pitch-black testimony to his mental state. But it is a triumph: between its first version, from March 1981, and the re-recording released in September, you can hear a new band beginning to coalesce.Not everything on Technique was musically influenced by the sound of the clubs in Ibiza, where the initial recording sessions took place, but all of it seemed to be imbued with the island’s spirit. Its marvellous closer, Dream Attack, is guitar-based, but sounds warm and sunlit, while the opening lyrics seem to reflect on the morning after a night on the dancefloor.Music Complete’s belated homage to the Italo disco that helped shift New Order out of their post-Joy Division mourning is a delight. There is a sly playfulness about it that was noticeably lacking in their 00s albums, its mood further buoyed by Elly “La Roux” Jackson’s backing vocals. Chemical Brother Tom Rowlands’ amped-up remix is great, too.Frequently giving the impression that he writes down the first thing that comes into his head with a shrug of “That’ll do”, Sumner is capable of great lyrics. As the producer Stephen Hague pointed out, the chilling 1963 is a “song about domestic violence you can dance to”. Too good for its original B-side status, it ended up as a single in 1995.Written, recorded and mixed in one sleepless 72-hour session, the full-length version of The Perfect Kiss might be the best New Order 12in mix of the lot. Nine explosive, unpredictable minutes take in everything from slap bass to frogs croaking and build into a fantastic, extended, euphoric climax.A beautiful, stately homage to Kraftwerk – specifically 1977’s Europe Endless – Your Silent Face is one of New Order’s greatest album tracks and an attempt to puncture their sombre post-Joy Division image. After four verses of bleak imagery (“Rise and fall of shame, a search that shall remain”), it concludes with an exasperated: “Why don’t you piss off?”A flop on release, incredibly, Bizarre Love Triangle is one of New Order’s most-covered tracks – everyone from the Killers to Scarlett Johansson has had a go, attesting to its beautiful melody and affecting lyrics. But the production on the original is spectacular, too – chattering sequenced synths, orchestral flurries, explosive drum rolls – and the Shep Pettibone remix is superb.In the words of Morris, the making of Republic was “very unpleasant”, fuelled less by a desire to record a new album than a need to make money in the wake of the collapse of Factory Records. You wouldn’t know that from its lead single, as perfectly formed a song as New Order have written.Technique is New Order’s best album and Vanishing Point may be its best track. It is the perfect example of how effortlessly they incorporate house music into their sound but, moreover, it is just a fantastic song, the sun of its melody at odds with the melancholy of Sumner’s vocal and lyrics.Blue Monday is musical alchemy in action. A patchwork of thefts (from Donna Summer, Kraftwerk, Ennio Morricone and Klein \u0026amp MBO’s Dirty Talk) and mistakes (the melody line was incorrectly entered into the sequencer) was transformed into one of the greatest, most instantly recognisable songs of its era.Romantic isn’t an adjective readily associated with New Order, but it fits the wonderful Thieves Like Us perfectly. It is richly melodic, with layer upon layer of lush synth and a vocal that is the opposite of Blue Monday’s icy blankness the occasional off-key fragility only adds to the song’s emotional impact.The fade in at the start of Temptation feels like clouds parting, the song itself – ramshackle but danceable, gleefully poppy, falsetto vocals – evidence that New Order had hit on a new, distinct identity. You can understand why the band chose to re-record it more slickly in 1987, but the original’s cack-handed exuberance is part of its charm.In truth, you could pick anything in this Top 10 as New Order’s greatest song – there is not much to separate them – but my personal preference is True Faith. The lyrics are brilliant – written from the perspective of an unrepentant heroin addict, an unlikely state of affairs given that Sumner and Hague apparently “set out to write a hit single” – Sumner’s ambiguous vocal is perfect and the melody is effortless, the sound a subtly turned example of New Order’s nonpareil ability to meld club influences with rock music."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9d58d4701887309654c16ba95ad55642981a194/0_0_4415_2943/master/4415.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=890f6076baafc5080b472217ec0199a9 1320w","title":"womens six nations in jeopardy over covid 19 london irish get go ahead rugby union","story":"The Women’s Six Nations is in doubt because of the rising number of Covid-19 infections, but the Premiership has avoided more cancellations this weekend despite 16 more players testing positive.No date has been set for the start of this year’s Women’s Six Nations, in which most of the players, apart from England’s, are amateur or semi-professional. The men’s tournament kicks off on 6 February and the women’s World Cup is due to start in September with Ireland, Scotland and Italy yet to qualify.“I do have concerns about how well we are going to get through this period,” the Rugby Football Union’s head of women’s performance, Nicky Ponsford, told the BBC. “I am relatively confident about how England are going to be able to deal with it, but there are different challenges in different unions.”France are semi-professional while the players in the other four nations are amateur, which creates a number of logistical problems, starting with testing. It was decided before the discovery of a new Covid-19 variant and a sharp increase in the number of infections, not to change the start date from next month even though only England fulfilled all their fixtures last year.“We will be looking over the next 10 days to see if we can get through the entire Six Nations or as much of it as we can,” Ponsford said. “It was the right thing at the time to leave the tournament where it was, but the world has changed again. It is becoming more challenging and there is a lot to put in the mix.”The sharp rise in the number of infections is shown in the Premiership’s weekly testing round this season. The first four yielded 13 positives – eight players and five members of staff – but the number in the next four jumped to 82, including 64 players. Five matches were cancelled as a consequence, including Saturday’s east Midlands derby between Northampton and Leicester.London Irish’s match at Harlequins on Sunday will go ahead after the club’s training ground was closed last week, and the match against Northampton called off, following a number of positive tests. It has led to criticism of the policy of awarding four points to the side that did not cause the game to be cancelled and two to the other.“I do not think it is appropriate when people are quite ill with the virus to be deflating a system that was agreed by everyone before the season started,” said Declan Kidney, the London Irish director of rugby. “It could have an effect from a rugby point of view, but from a health and human perspective the main thing is to get rid of the virus. Some of our players have been hit hard by it. We were ready to play last week but had a civic duty not to.”David Young, who left Wasps last February, has been appointed the interim director of rugby by Cardiff Blues after the departure this week of the Australian John Mulvihill “for personal reasons”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e5bced2f79c335f94acb9650e4f2b1c035cc7a3/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26fa18952138265fa723734180de8e30","title":"talking horses bha denies claim that staff get less than living wage","story":"Nick Rust, the recently departed chief executive of racing’s ruling body, made the claim during an appearance on SkyRacing’s ruling body has denied that any of its London-based staff are earning less than the city’s living wage, contradicting a claim made by its outgoing chief executive, Nick Rust, in a valedictory TV show broadcast several times over the Christmas period. Rust made the claim in order to back up an assertion that the British Horseracing Authority is “considerably cheaper” than equivalent bodies in other major racing nations.During an hour-long programme labelled ‘Rust’s Reflections’ on Sky Sports Racing, Rust said: “If you look at the average salaries of people who work here, we have a considerable amount of people who, even though they’re based in London, some of these people, are earning less than the national average wage and sometimes in London not hitting the living wage.” The London living wage, calculated to reflect the higher cost of living in the capital, was raised to £10.85 per hour in November. Having checked twice, the BHA insists it has no London-based staff earning less than that, whether working full-time or otherwise.Asked for an explanation, Rust told : “If the BHA team says there are none below, then I’m probably out of date now, though we did have some in London below that level at one point. We did make an effort to bring up the lower salaries a bit, within the limited context of what was possible.”Rust, whose term as chief executive ended at New Year, declined to answer further questions, including whether he should have checked the accuracy of such a point before using it in support of his contention about funding, and whether it would reflect poorly on him if, as he believed, London staff were getting less than the living wage after he had been chief executive for six years.On the same programme, Rust stated his own salary for 2020 as being £320,000. The BHA said it could not verify that figure until its finances for last year had been audited but it is thought to be in line with a publicised salary cut taken by executives during the shutdown last spring. Rust’s pay for 2019 was £434,000 according to the BHA’s annual report.

Wade does a good job at backward square to turn a single into nothing. Cummins then does an ever better job to beat Pujara’s outside edge with one that pitches just outside off and nips away from the right-hander. Lovely ball, but Pujara didn’t go chasing. Maiden over.30th over: India 84-1 (Gill 49, Pujara 3) Lyon to Pujara. Australia can smell blood with the new batsman. Slip, bat-pad and short-leg all waiting for a catch. The fielders ask the question as Pujara sticks his front leg in front of one turning in from outside off, but the umpire isn’t interested. Lyon then strays onto Pujara’s pads at the end of the over, allowing him to get off the mark with three through midwicket.29th over: India 81-1 (Gill 49, Pujara 0) Cummins returns. A quite breathtaking shot from Gill, who leans back and punches with a diagonal bat right out of the middle for four. The shot of a serious talent. Cummins responds in kind, beating the outside edge, before Gill plays a very similar shot to his boundary, though a little softer this time, to collect two more.28th over: India 75-1 (Gill 43, Pujara 0) Pujara joins Gill in the middle. Gill drives nicely through extra cover for four before a single hands the new batsman the strike on the last ball of the over. Close catchers on both sides of the wicket. No wicket but no run for Pujara, who clips past short-leg but can’t beat midwicket.The breakthrough comes, finally. Hazlewood looks to take the pace off the ball just a little as Rohit hits on the up, offering a tough chance low to the paceman’s left and in the end it’s a nice catch. Not the easiest of chances off your own bowling and a much-needed strike for Australia.26th over: India 68-0 (Rohit 24, Gill 38) A rare wide ball from Lyon and Gill doesn’t need asking twice as he swats the half-volley through extra cover for four. Lyon is then straighter, a bit shorter, and better as Gill retreats into his crease and fails to beat the infield for four successive balls before Lyon again loses his radar and is taken for two behind square.25th over: India 62-0 (Rohit 24, Gill 32) Not a bad over from Hazlewood, with a catcher at short mid-on for the drive, but Gill has his eye well and truly in. Five dot balls make way for a single as Gill clips one behind square.24th over: India 61-0 (Rohit 24, Gill 31) Lyon v Rohit continues and the former looks to have gained reward for a good spell when Rohit is given out, caught by Wade at short-leg. Australia are ecstatic but this looks dubious. Not sure there was bat there. Review! And there was no bat or glove there at all, seemingly missing by some way in fact. Not out! The breakthrough continues to elude Australia.23rd over: India 61-0 (Rohit 24, Gill 31) Two boundaries in two Hazlewood deliveries, one off Gills blade - a brutal pull through midwicket - and one a bouncer that flies high over Gill and Paine for four byes. India going along very nicely here. This is officially a good batting deck.22nd over: India 52-0 (Rohit 24, Gill 27) Wade inflicted some pain on India’s short-leg today and now it’s his turn as Rohit sweeps strongly onto what looks like his ribs. That’s gotta hurt, but on the plus side Wade saved runs. Both Paine and Lyon then rise in appeal for leg before but the umpire isn’t interested. Was Rohit playing a shot? Wasn’t he? Paine says no. Paul Wilson says yes. And the latter wins.21st over: India 50-0 (Rohit 22, Gill 27) Cummins’ five-over spell comes to an end as Paine turns to Hazlewood. Might have anticipated Starc, though Hazlewood was so very good earlier on. And he’s very good again as he pierces Gill’s defences, giving rise to a half-hearted appeal for caught behind. The decision is not out and Australia opt not to review, but my that was close to the inside edge before clipping the pad. Snicko doesn’t like it so good decision from both umpire and Paine.20th over: India 50-0 (Rohit 22, Gill 27) Superb areas from Lyon but Rohit is maintaining his concentration. No width, a good length every time, and Lyon returns a second successive maiden. But what Australia need right now is a wicket.19th over: India 50-0 (Rohit 22, Gill 27) Still more from Cummins but the ascendancy remains with these India openers, who take their stand to fifty courtesy of Gill’s two runs through the covers. Cummins tightens up thereafter to return five successive dot balls.18th over: India 48-0 (Rohit 22, Gill 25) “That’s nicely bowled, Gaz,” says Tim Paine. And he’s right. Lyon comes back from his 12-run effort the previous over to keep Rohit on his crease with a line just outside off, turning into the right-hander. A maiden and a very good response from Lyon. Didn’t look like conceding a run.17th over: India 48-0 (Rohit 22, Gill 25) The tussle between Cummins and Gill continues. Excellent bowling from Cummins, mostly straight or just outside off, but he fluffs his lines on the last ball of the over as Gill clips one off his pads for two through midwicket.16th over: India 46-0 (Rohit 22, Gill 23) Go fetch. Determined to not let Lyon dictate terms as he did in the first over, Rohit waltzes down the pitch and positively middles one over long-on for six. A big shot and one of even greater intent. Rohit places a cherry on top at the end of the over, descending on one knee and sweeping delicately for four. Beautiful and beastly all in the one over. Which went for 12 runs, if you don’t mind. 15th over: India 34-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 22) Oooh, close. Cummins nips a shortish one back into Gill, who boots the ball away from the stumps after it ricochets off his torso. He’s really putting his back into this over, Cummins. But Gill is equal to the task. A maiden, and a good battle between bat and ball.14th over: India 34-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 22) Lyon indeed. Hazlewood’s was one of the better spells not to pick up a wicket. Doesn’t look to be a great deal of turn for Lyon but his areas are spot on and Rohit is very watchful, very respectful in a series of forward defensives. A maiden to begin with.13th over: India 34-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 22) Nice punch off the back foot earns Gill two runs and the opener raises the stakes later in the over, sitting back and waiting outside off before steering Cummins over gully for four. Classy shot. Lyon soon?12th over: India 28-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 16) Hazlewood again and again he’s causing the India openers concerns. Rohit plays around a straight one but height means leg before isn’t a concern. Looks to be Hazlewood’s lift and seam movement that Rohit and Gill are struggling with. Another maiden from Hazlewood. Only thing that’s missing from a very good spell is a wicket.11th over: India 28-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 16) Cummins continues. Short to begin with but then he demands Gill plays at the ball as the opener picks up two off a thick edge that he didn’t quite control. Cummins concludes the over with a fine piece of fielding off his own bowling to keep the over to those two runs.10th over: India 26-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 14) We’re back. Hazlewood was the pick of the quicks before tea and he picks up where he left off, beating Rohit with a frankly unplayable leg cutter. Absolutely spat off the pitch, that one. Too good to get a wicket. Not a man alive could get near it. Nice and straight the rest of the over, including one that hits the top of the pads but draws only a stifled appeal. Height clearly an issue. Maybe going down leg, too. But a great over. And another maiden, the fourth in a row.That camera work showing Jadanger’s swoop and bullet. Just exquisite. And you could see he knew he was going to hit, even as he threw it. What a rockstar, what a talentGreat knock by smith too and nice tony see him go agricultural at the end a la EdgbastonOften say 330 first dig sets up the perfect teat. Bring it on!We all make a teat of ourselves from time to time, Royce. But yes, Smith was great and Jadeja is a multifaceted talent. There is a lot to like about this India team. And to think Kohli isn’t here.Well, Starc seems incapable of bowling the right line and length today. And they\u0027re all bowling too straight. No point in having 2 slips and a gully if you\u0027re basically bowling middleleg most of the time. This pitch rewards bowlers who put the ball in the right place, as that snorter from Hazlewood showed.Cummins, too, looks to be getting it right. Reckon we’ll see Lyon before too long, though.Like a ‘spurned lover’? I’m trying to work that metaphor out!Definitely a long bow, NC, but Gill had shown no interest in Starc’s advances outside off-stump. So he bowled straighter. Still no? Fair enough.An assured beginning to this response from India’s opening pair. Both Rohit and Gill defended well while playing their shots to the bad balls. With all of India’s wickets in hand, this match sits on a knife’s edge with a stack of cricket to be played.9th over: India 26-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 14) Cummins to bowl what is likely the final over before tea. Two slips and a gully for Gill, who would love nothing more than keep Cummins at bay and go safely to the break. And that’s exactly what transpires as Cummins bowls the third consecutive maiden of the innings. Time for tea.8th over: India 26-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 14) Ripper of a ball from Hazlewood nips away from Rohit and beats the bat. Or does it? Paine is interested. Very interested. But he’s not getting much support from his teammates and there will be no review. Good lift off the deck there, too, from Hazlewood. My, does he know how to hit that seam. Another maiden. Great over.Who would’ve known that 338 would be such an elusive number?7th over: India 26-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 14) Cummins replaces Starc with just a handful of overs remaining before tea. The fast bowler immediately finds his zone, becalming Gill with excellent line and length, before the India opener drives at a wider one only to be denied by a fine stop by Labuschagne at extra cover. Cummins commences with a maiden.6th over: India 26-0 (Rohit 11, Gill 14) An over of good line and length from Hazlewood, quite full at times, is ruined when Rohit tucks into a short one and hooks very high backward of square for four. A nice response from Hazlewood, however, as he finds the outside edge of Rohit’s bat. No danger, however, as the ball lands safely in front of gully.5th over: India 21-0 (Rohit 7, Gill 13) Starc again. Like a spurned lover, he straightens his line to Gill before again going across the body of the right-hander - but this time he’s too short and Gill rocks onto the back foot before crunching the paceman through the covers for four. Another short ball follows - this time it’s a straight one, and a no-ball! - but the outcome is the same as Gill hooks with great skill and confidence. Two wonderful shots. India can now rejoice in their best opening partnership of the series.4th over: India 11-0 (Rohit 7, Gill 4) Rohit, on the other hand, is more inclined to play his strokes and this really is a delightful shot for four, capitalising on a bit of width from Hazlewood and timing his punch wide of gully to perfection. Two runs follow and a tuck behind square off his pads is money for jam for Rohit. Now who’s the one handing out presents?Got something to say, Marnus?3rd over: India 5-0 (Rohit 1, Gill 4) Starc wants Gill to get involved, wants him to play, but flashing away at a left-armer angling darts across your body is a recipe for failure. And the result is a maiden over.2nd over: India 5-0 (Rohit 1, Gill 4) Paine puts a bow on the new cherry and tosses it to Hazlewood, wishing him a very happy birthday. None of that is true other than the fact it is Hazlewood’s 30th birthday and he is in fact bowling. Plenty of bluster from the birthday boy, and some seam movement, and Rohit respectfully rewards Hazlewood with a gift of his own: a maiden over.Ruth Purdue asks: “Any thoughts on the batting collapses of this Australian team? Seems to be a common theme, although this is a bit better. Is it skill rather than mental?”Hi Ruth. I would say it’s a combination of skill, mentality and old-fashioned gumption. And some very good bowling. It can’t be Christmas every day. This Aussie tail has been known to wag quite well, you know.1st over: India 5-0 (Rohit 1, Gill 4) Starc with the new ball for Australia. Plenty of swing first delivery into Rohit and it’s down leg side anyway, inviting the India opener to flick his wrists and pick up a single down to fine-leg. Warner and his comically enormous moustache are stationed at first slip. No running required there. Gill sees off four dot ball before Starc loses his line and is punched down the ground for four. Bright start from India.An emphatic return to form by Steve Smith but Australia will have started the day wanting more from their first innings. The departure of Marnus Labuschagne in the morning precipitated a loss of eight wickets for 132 runs, almost all of which were scored by Smith. Mitchell Starc (24) was Smith’s only partner of note and now it’s India’s turn to put this total of 338 into perspective.Smith again goes after Bumrah and this time he’s got the width to do it, swatting him to the deep midwicket fence. A couple flicked fine follow and then the batsmen again want two backward of square but Jadeja has an evil arm and throws the stumps down from distance. Incredible fielding, lethal accuracy.105th over: Australia 331-9 (Smith 124, Hazlewood 1) It’s T20 time as Smith tries the ramp to Jadeja and fails, then tries the ramp again and succeeds, picking up two runs behind the keeper. A single follows and Hazlewood again does well to see off the remaining two deliveries. What’s the rush? These two could go on like this all day.104th over: Australia 326-9 (Smith 119, Hazlewood 1) Smith premeditates a crude slog - can’t really describe it as anything other - and takes Bumrah for two over the covers, before playing a far more cultured ramp-like shot to a short ball that flies over the slip cordon for four. A single puts Hazlewood on strike and the No 11 does what every No 11 should do: take a single to put the star bat back on strike. A beautiful shot from Smith follows, a straight punch to a yorker that goes down the ground for three. Most would’ve done well to simply keep it out. Hazlewood sees off the final ball - it’s 11 off the over - and Smith is on strike again.With eight wickets down, the ton safely tucked under the belt, Smith now wants runs. And fair enough, too. A deft slog-sweep for four is followed by a single and unfortunately this puts Lyon on strike. The No 10 bunts away a dot ball before being struck on his toes, plumb in front by Jadeja, and is confidently given out leg before. Lyon decides to waste everyone’s time by demanding a review, and that’s precisely what it is: a waste of time. Tell your story walking, Gaz.Big stand-and-deliver six from Starc, who barely moves his body or feet to Saini but a slight swivel of the hips is enough to clear the square-leg rope. Extraordinary shot. The No 9 - No 9, really??!! - tries a similar shot and picks up two but then attempts another ambitious shot and this time runs out of lives, holing out to Gill running around from mid-on. Nice, cameo knock from Starc.101st over: Australia 301-7 (Smith 104, Starc 16) Jadeja continues in the way only Jadeja can: at breakneck speed. Both batsmen pick up a couple of singles and we carry on.How’s this for emotion?100th over: Australia 299-7 (Smith 103, Starc 15) I suspect that with the Smith hundred out of the way, we might see Starc swing a bit more freely from now on. He doesn’t get a chance in this over, getting bombed by Navdeep Saini with the short ball. Fourth time lucky, Starc flinches away a single to square leg.

Drift was filmed by the River Aare, near Marston’s home in Switzerland. Balancing on fallen trees or calf-deep in the water, moving meditatively to a specially composed score by regular collaborator Philip Feeney, she offers a welcome retreat from the current world.A powerful telling of the prejudices faced by black ballet dancer Marie-Astrid Mence during her training in her home city of Paris, directed by dancer turned film-maker Rebecca Murray and featured on Nowness. Mence’s gentle voiceover belies the ugliness of her experiences: bullied about her body, told to switch to street dance, made to dance the men’s roles. A dancer with Ballet Black since 2014, Mence proved her detractors wrong, but hers was not an isolated experience and it’s a subject as vital as ever.Just two minutes long but a clever setup: director Daniel McKee uses a large rotating mirror to switch our view between two dancers, Theo Canham-Spence and Florence Pearl, as they move in neat yet somehow languorous choreography by Grace Nicol. First they alternate at leisurely pace, the two dancers like flipsides of a coin, then it accelerates to a cinefilm-style flicker, the dancers merging to the sound of Ben Vince’s saxophone.One from last year you may have missed, a series of collaborations between Welsh poets and dancers, each with a distinct flavour.

With creative and fun virtual activities, it seemsNurturing a sense of shared purpose with work colleagues is challenging in these days of remote work and video meetings. Gone are post-work pints, sandwich-queue chats, tasting your colleague’s “cake-off” creation, and anything else resembling physical proximity and connection to your team. But with a little ingenuity – and a tolerance for 2D socialising – it’s still possible to keep spirits high and have fun.From virtual magicians and online games to judging cakes purely on how delicious they look on Zoom, employees are finding new ways to bond with colleagues – remotely. Events such as quizzes and lunchtime yoga may even have become more popular now that people can log on from home rather than having to stay late at the office or endure a lunch-hour sweat.Jade Emmons, a London-based communications manager for Degreed, a US education technology company, spent part of Halloween in fancy dress, running around her home seeking random items of clothing and a pumpkin as part of a competitive scavenger hunt. That was one of several online games held during her company’s virtual party.Other companies have been equally imaginative. One media organisation replaced its summer party with a global rendition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which correspondents from around the world took on some of Shakespeare’s most popular roles.Meanwhile, at Kindred, a PR firm, winning the 2020 baking competition hinges on how well you can pipe icing rather than perfect the best rise, as in previous years. Each participant received a Betty Crocker cake mix, so the real challenge was the decoration. A Chris Whitty cake – very 2020 – dreamed up by associate director Beccie Stevenson, made it to the final round. “You can’t taste it so it’s all down to the aesthetic,” she says.Stevenson is also a fan of a monthly initiative called Change Maker that gets people to nominate a colleague of the month. Her last pick was Emma Parrish, who won in October for the effort she put into suggesting books, podcasts and music to celebrate Black History Month. “She tackled quite difficult conversations, head on,” says Stevenson. Each winner gets to virtually spin a wheel to win a prize, which ranges from an alarm clock to a pair of sheepskin slippers.Nick Winham, whose job is overseeing a programme to recruit and train the next generation of talent for the software provider ServiceNow, is one of the California-based company’s culture champions, helping to run initiatives to keep its dispersed workforce feeling connected. He says the shift to remote working has resulted in many more people taking part in events such as quizzes. “When we did them at the office, we’d only get 15 people at most,” he says. “Doing them virtually, we’re getting 40 to 50. Other colleagues join in with their families.” Virtual yoga and meditation sessions are also proving to be much more popular than the real-life versions ever were.For companies keen to introduce their own programmes, Winham’s tips include blocking off time during the working day for non-work sessions. His quizzes, for instance, are at 4pm on Thursdays, with a takeaway pizza prize for the winner. “It gets very competitive,” he says.A “step-up” challenge earlier this summer, where ServiceNow colleagues formed teams to record their daily step counts, proved popular thanks to a novel twist that saw two executive directors volunteer to do something different with their hair depending on how much money was raised during the week-long challenge. “That created engagement,” Winham says. “Step-up September” developed as a result, with teams from across Europe.Other activities encourage people to chat openly about the challenges of working from home, with some offering coping tips. “The main advice has been to take a break,” Winham says, adding that he went for a walk before talking to me.London-based LocalGlobe, which invests in startup tech companies, hosts virtual “lunch and learn sessions” with guests as erse as the founder of the small business supporter Funding Circle and a representative of the anti-poverty group Camden Giving. Emma Phillips, a partner at LocalGlobe, says she wants to do all she can to keep employees engaged and connected. “At the moment people are feeling more cut off and isolated than ever, and there is concern that once we’ve defeated Covid-19, we’ll have an even worse mental health pandemic on our hands.”Often the simplest ideas can help compensate for the lack of in-person interaction. Online channels dedicated to different interests, from cats to physical fitness, work well at Degreed, says Emmons, although she steers clear of the HIIT workout and body-building chat. “Our London office manager has a virtual running club that she’s tried to convince me to join, but I’ve managed to dodge it so far!”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances.

However, he conceded the “rate-limiting” factor in efforts to get people vaccinated was supply from the manufacturers.Standing in front of Dr Ammara Hughes’s surgery, the health secretary said: “It’s great news this morning that the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is from right now being rolled out to GP surgeries across the country.“For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine, we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well, and it’s working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed.“The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine. We’re working with the companies – both Pfizer and AstraZeneca – to increase the supply.”It was confirmed on Thursday evening that the surgery he visited later took delivery of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine.The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Hancock’s visit to the surgery was akin to a scene from political satire The Thick of It, but added: “Sadly, it’s no laughing matter.”Dr Hughes said Hancock was “quite surprised actually to learn that we don’t know when all of our deliveries are coming, they’re very ad hoc”. The surgery has been administering the Pfizer vaccine since the middle of December and has so far received three deliveries.Dr Hughes added: “So we’ve continued to vaccinate with Pfizer in the surgery, and what we’re hoping to do with the AstraZeneca when it arrives is to go out to the most clinically vulnerable and housebound. So that’s what we’ll be doing.“We won’t start vaccinating within the surgery with our AstraZeneca doses until we’ve finished our Pfizer vaccines.”Both AstraZeneca and Pfizer have said they are on track to deliver vaccines as agreed with the government.The government announced nearly 1.5 million people had now been inoculated against Covid-19.PA Media contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452757.1610058745!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government u turn on partial reopening of schools amid mounting opposition from teachers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPlans to reopen special schools or classes for children with special needs have also been shelved.

It said the plan was for all other children to be taught remotely.In a statement on Thursday night, Ms Foley confirmed all schools would now remain closed from Monday January 11th.From this date, all students, including children with special needs, “will resort to a programme of remote learning in line with the rest of the Government restrictions”.Ms Foley’s statement came after confirmation by the two main secondary school teachers’ unions that they would not be co-operating with the initial plan to reopen schools on Monday.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland has welcomed the decision “now taken, somewhat belatedly, by Government to finally do the right thing”.It said its members would not be attending their workplaces for in-school teaching next Monday, “or on subsequent days, but will be available to provide emergency remote teaching and to support their students including, in particular, students with special educational needs”.‘Significant concerns’The Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI) said it had instructed its members not to co-operate with Monday’s planned reopening. “The decision is based on significant concerns about the health and safety of students, teachers and other staff,” it said.One Dublin secondary school had earlier announced it would defy the Government plan. Alexandra College in Milltown, south Dublin, told parents and students that a partial reopening would pose unacceptable health risks.A number of other schools, including special schools, had also signalled they would not reopen on Monday.“It is with regret that I announce that, despite the confirmation by public health that schools remain safe, that children in special schools and special classes and Leaving Certificate students will not be extended in-person learning.”Labour leader Alan Kelly said earlier he expected the Government to “come around” and reverse its decision to continue school classes for Leaving Certificate students during January.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald had said there was real and growing concern about the plan to bring Leaving Cert students into schools next week.Relative safetyMeanwhile, public health officials on Thursday night restated their views about the relative safety of schools in the pandemic, while expressing concerns about the overall level of transmission of the virus in society.“Schools are not dangerous, they are safe places in relative terms,” chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said.Because of the level of infection in the community, issues associated with schools such as parents meeting up and transport had to be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) when it came to children returning to school, and not just education itself within the classroom, he pointed out.He said the “quantum of activity” involved in allowing Leaving Cert students to attend school three days per week was “totally different” to allowing all schoolchildren back to school full-time.A further 10 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by Nphet on Thursday along with 6,521 new confirmed cases of the disease.The reproduction number for Covid-19, a key measure of how fast the disease is spreading, now stands at between 2.4 and 3, higher than at any time since the start of the pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452666.1610049472!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"record number from deis schools progress to third level","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe latest data shows a record 64 per cent of students from disadvantaged or Deis schools went to third level last year, up from 57 per cent in 2019.

With the bilingual Leaving Cert, students sit an extended German language and literature paper and a section of European history through German. This satisfies the language proficiency requirement to study at a university in Germany. All students take the Sprachdiplom exams, which confer the same language requirements to study in Germany. In 2015 the school introduced the Sek-1 curriculum, where maths, biology, science, history and German are taught through a German-language curriculum. With the French school Lycée Français d’Irlande sharing the same campus as the Deutsche Schule, some of the classes are held together (through English), increasing the cultural ersity and European vision that students encounter day to day.Interesting fact: Past pupils have often gone on to international careers. Perhaps the best-known past pupil of recent times is the multi-award-winning journalist Sally Hayden, who has worked with CNN, Time, BBC, the Washington Post, the , Channel 4 News, Al Jazeera, the Times of India, National Geographic and many more. She currently reports from Africa for The  and recently delivered a (virtual) talk to the school’s current pupils.In one of the highest-profile fallouts from this year’s calculated grades process, St Kilian’s, which specialises in German teaching, was disappointed when only 14 per cent of its students achieved a H1 in German. Based on past performance, the school expected half of its students to secure top marks.The case ended up in court, where school principal Alice Lynch – who in 2012 became the first non-German to be appointed to the position – presented evidence that the State’s standardised grades model produced “inexplicable” results.“They learn more than how to order a meal or buy a ticket in German,” says Lynch. “They become comfortable with German literature and natural conversation.”According to last year’s  feeder school list, 100 per cent of the class of 2019 went on to third level, although this figure includes students who may have deferred for a year or more, perhaps having travelled overseas.St Kilian’s, which takes its name from the Irish missionary bishop who ministered in present-day north Bavaria at the end of the seventh century and promoted early educational links between Ireland and Germany, has always looked outwards to Europe, and runs an innovative human rights module in transition year that focuses on freedom of speech, political freedom and migrants. It has won several Concern debate trophies.Because of their German-language proficiency, graduates of the school have more study and work abroad options – or did at least until Covid-19 forced so many changes on our lives.“A few years ago, our students won third prize in a green-schools competition, where they presented to industrialists in Germany,” says Lynch. “We partnered with a German school in the Hague for a project on coastal communities and travelled to present to each other. The German soccer team came to visit us shortly after winning the 2014 World Cup. Every other year, we’ve taken part in the European games at our sister school in Brussels, and they play Gaelic and hurling when they come here. We do three-week work experience exchanges in Hamburg. All of these have had to be cancelled because of Covid, so we’ve moved a lot online.”The school has no uniform and attracts parents who want a bilingual education for their children. “German and French parents are not used to paying fees,” says Lynch. “”We have a lot of children from mixed German and Irish backgrounds, and if you ask them if they’re German or Irish, they’ll say Irish. But typically they all have a strong connection to Germany, perhaps through a parent or grandparent.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double the level of same period in 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452709.1610053892!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"long covid can affect people even with mild initial symptoms study","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Liam Townsend said the results highlighted how there is no simple diagnostic test to predict which patients with Covid-19 will suffer long-term effects such as fatigue. Photograph: iStockPersistent ill-health can result from contracting Covid-19 regardless of the severity of the initial infection, according to the findings of a new study by a team of Irish researchers.In what was the first global study of its kind, researchers from Trinity College Dublin assessed lung function and respiratory symptoms among 153 patients infected with Covid-19, including those who self-isolated at home and others who required ICU care in hospital.The study’s lead author, Liam Townsend, research fellow at TCD’s Department of Clinical Medicine and specialist registrar at St James’s Hospital, said little had previously been known about lung health following infection with the virus that causes Covid-19 and whether there were links between respiratory problems, fatigue and ill-health and the initial severity of the disease.While fatigue, ill-health and breathlessness were all common symptoms as a result of Covid-19 infection, Dr Townsend said they appeared to be unrelated to the severity of the initial infection.Chest X-rayAll patients who participated in the study were given a chest X-ray and six-minute walk test.Dr Townsend admitted that researchers were surprised at the findings of the study, which is published in the latest edition of the Annals of the American Thoracic Society.“We expected a greater number of abnormal chest X-rays. We also expected the measures of ongoing ill-health and abnormal findings to be related to the severity of initial infection, which was not the case,” Dr Townsend said.Researchers examined a number of measures of recovery for the patients who attended an outpatient clinic, with a median of 75 days after they had been diagnosed with Covid-19.The findings of the study suggest that Covid-19 does not cause significant fibrosis as only 4 per cent of patients showed signs of lung scarring on CT scans.‘Full health’It found that 62 per cent of patients felt they had not returned to full health, while 47 per cent were classified as having fatigue.“Patients who felt they had to exert themselves during moderate exercise also reported they felt fatigue and poor health,” Dr Townsend said.He said the findings showed patients experienced significant symptoms, but there was a relatively low rate of people with abnormal X-rays.Dr Townsend said the results highlighted how there is no simple diagnostic test to predict which patients with Covid-19 will suffer long-term effects such as fatigue.Dr Townsend said it was important that all patients diagnosed with Covid-19 received follow-up treatment, irrespective of whether they suffered mild or severe infection.The study suggested the highest-risk group for suffering post-Covid symptoms appeared to be females under 60 years, which Dr Townsend said indicated genetic factors might be a factor."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452645.1610048143!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north s chief vet gives assurance on assistance dogs post brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew arrangements for bringing pets and assistance dogs to Northern Ireland from Great Britain are in effect following the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1st. The North’s Chief Veterinary Officer has pledged that assistance dogs will not be prevented from entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain despite new rules covering the travel of pets across the Irish Sea border. “No genuine assistance dog will be turned back,” Robert Huey said. “We will find a way of doing it. “I don’t want to say much more because I’d be admitting to breaking the law so I’m not going to go there.”While he warned that he would not “buy everything being an assistance dog”, genuine assistance dogs will not be turned back.Mr Huey appeared before the Stormont Agriculture Committee on Thursday, and was questioned by MLAs about new arrangements for bringing pets and assistance dogs to Northern Ireland from Great Britain following the end of the Brexit transition period on January 1st. The UK has Part 2 listed status under the EU Pet Travel Scheme, which means that pet dogs and assistance dogs, as well as cats and ferrets, ravelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland must have an Animal Health Certificate (AHC) from a vet and arrive through an official point of entry. They must also be vaccinated against rabies and dogs must be treated for tapeworm. Neither disease is present on the island of Ireland. There is no such requirement for pets or assistance dogs travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. ‘Common sense’ Minister for Agriculture and the Environment, the DUP MLA Edwin Poots, wrote to the UK’s Secretary for Agriculture and to the European Commission on Thursday asking for a Common Travel Area for pets to be applied between Great Britain and the island of Ireland.This, he said, was “common sense” and would “alleviate the real and serious concerns of pet travelers across all jurisdictions.” He said the difficulties caused to assistance dog owners and assistance training puppies meant “some of the most vulnerable in our society are being directly affected. This cannot and must not be the case,” he said. The Chief Veterinary Officer said officials in Northern Ireland would not enforce the new rules until February 1st “to give people a chance to get ready.” The new requirements, he said, were “onerous and it is expensive and in my view it’s unnecessary.” His officials, Mr Huey said, had been working with colleagues in London and Dublin to try to find a resolution, and while he was hopeful it would be solved, he did not believe it would be soon. “I was hopeful that at an operational level I would be able to find some room for pragmatism but the legislation is written in a very black and white way, I can find no wiggle at all, so I have no alternative but to enforce this legislation,” he said. “We’ll be doing it sensitively, pragmatically and sensibly as far as we can, but I am not happy with the situation we find ourselves in, my minister isn’t happy with the situation we find ourselves in, and we’ll be doing all we can to try and mitigate this problem.” In a statement on its website, the UK government said it recognised the changes would take time to adjust to and it was working with the authorities in the North “on an enforcement approach that takes this challenge into account. “This approach will be implemented in a way which supports pet owners and assistance dog users while the Government pursues a permanent solution,” it said.

Photograph:   Brian LawlessPA Watched by a wearied and fearful country, the Government slumped into the third national lockdown on Wednesday, warning that the third wave of the pandemic now threatens to overwhelm the health service as numbers of infections climb to previously unimaginable heights.Barely an hour after the Taoiseach and his fellow Coalition leaders announced the new lockdown measures, public health chiefs released the latest daily number of new cases – just shy of 8,000. Unless these numbers begin to abate soon, they will crash through even the surge capacity in the health service that will surely be called into operation in the coming days. The leaders of the Government now fear that the health service will simply be unable to deal with the number of cases seeking admission to hospital wards and to intensive care units in the coming days and weeks.The important numbers over the coming days are not so much the case numbers, says one senior figure, it is the hospital numbers and the intensive care unit numbers. The nightmare scenario of last March is back: the wolf is at the door.The lockdown is – for everyone with the exception of the Leaving Cert students – as stringent as last March. Few sources who spoke privately on Wednesday night expected it to finish in three weeks. Social problemsAll the social problems that are exacerbated by these conditions – educational disadvantage, domestic violence, economic damage, and the rest of that grim procession – will return.

The truth is that the price is vastly more than anyone envisaged.The search for someone to blame is understandable, and will continue, even if there are more pressing matters for everyone to deal with right now. Internally within the Government, there is a cacophony of finger-pointing and dissent. But ultimately the Government as a whole makes the decisions and ultimately it is accountable for them. But such judgments will be more wisely made in the fullness of time, allowing for their consequences to play out, for better or for worse.However the blame game goes, the future of the Government’s authority – and therefore its ability to enforce its will, on Covid and other matters – rests on two issues. One is within its own control, the other is not.Fate of the country’s hospitalsThe first is the fate of the country’s hospitals over the coming fortnight. If the hospitals are overrun it will be a hammer blow to the Government’s authority and credibility. The claim the Coalition could reasonably make before Christmas – when it had the lowest infection rate and limited excess deaths – that it had managed the crisis well would no longer be tenable. The second issue is more – though not entirely – within the Government’s control. The roll-out of the vaccine has been slow to start. Unless it accelerates, the Government will look woefully inadequate, especially as vaccinations continue at an apparently rapid pace in the UK and elsewhere. Teething problems are understandable and there are constraints on supply. But if the Government is not vaccinating as quickly as it is receiving supplies very soon – and is able to demonstrate that it is – people will draw their own conclusions about its competence and credibility.

Photograph: AP PhotoMartin MeissnerSigns that a relatively high number of healthcare workers are unwilling to receive the coronavirus vaccine in some parts of Europe and the US have alarmed politicians and health experts, as countries struggle to contain a surge in infections and carry out mass vaccination.A poll released in mid-December caused surprise in Germany – the country that has been at the forefront of the race for a vaccine with biotech company BioNTech – by showing that half of surveyed nurses did not want to be vaccinated, along with a quarter of doctors. Those worries came back to the fore this week when the head of one German state said only a third of healthcare workers in his state were willing to get the jab.A high degree of reluctance among medical staff has also been observed in other parts of Europe and in the US. In France 76 per cent of senior care home staff said they did not want to get vaccinated, according to a poll of 2,000 such workers carried out last month.In Austria only half of the staff of care facilities in the region of Vorarlberg said they were willing to be inoculated, according to Austria’s public broadcaster. The Italian Federation of Medical Professional Associations said about 100 doctors were unwilling to receive the immunisation across the country.In the US a survey released last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation health think-tank found that 29 per cent of US healthcare workers would probably or definitely not get a vaccine, a slightly higher proportion than in the overall population (27 per cent). HesitantAnecdotal evidence from the first weeks of rollout in the US suggests staff at care homes are particularly hesitant to be vaccinated.Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio, said recently he was “troubled” by the relatively low numbers of nursing home workers taking the vaccine, with around 60 per cent of nursing home staff having declined the shot.Asked about vaccine hesitancy among health workers on Wednesday, Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn said his ministry had only anecdotal data, with starkly ergent results. In some nursing homes, he said, only 20 per cent of medics received a jab, while in others it was as high as 80 per cent. But he said data showed regular flu vaccines among medics was “unfortunately very, very below average”.“Promoting vaccination of healthcare workers is very important. We work in an environment full of vulnerable people, it is our responsibility to get it,” said Uwe Janssens, the author of the German survey released last month. “If people see healthcare workers are unconvinced, how will that affect our society?”Dr Janssens, general secretary of the German Society for Internal Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, decided to conduct his survey after being shocked to hear several nurses express concerns over the new mRNA technology, used by the two EU-approved vaccines BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna. Among the 2,305 survey respondents, many feared long-term side effects, while female nursing staff expressed concerns over their ability to get pregnant. Many interviewed, he said, appeared to have seen anti-vaccination videos spread online.Vaccine scepticism may already be affecting healthcare in parts of Germany. On Tuesday, Bodo Ramelow, head of the state of Thuringia, cited one clinic in the city of Eisenach that stopped taking Covid-19 patients – not because it was short on hospital beds, but because 100 employees were themselves sick or in quarantine.“This leads to a real problem because we want to make sure that these people, who work so very close to the virus, have the highest protection,” Mr Ramelow told MDR television. “I plead to everyone to go get it.” Health riskGermany, which is struggling to contain a second surge in Covid-19 infections, has imposed no legal requirement to take the vaccine, though some lawyers specialising in labour rights say medics could potentially face dismissal should their employers argue they were posing a health risk to patients.In Italy authorities are investigating 13 doctors accused of anti-vaccine propaganda or playing down the severity of the virus.“I am perplexed when I hear of fellow doctors or nurses reluctant to get the vaccine,” said Pierpaolo Sileri, Italy’s deputy health minister. “I can understand it regarding a member of the public who perhaps does not have the scientific understanding, but frankly, I think that those doctors and nurses, if they still have doubts after seeing everything that’s happened, are probably in the wrong job.”Markus Söder, head of Germany’s state of Bavaria, said on Tuesday that a public campaign was needed “to drum up support, not only for more vaccines, but also willingness to accept this vaccine. This will be a subject of tense debate.”The latest polls on vaccine acceptance, however, suggest that the public is not growing more confident. In the spring, 79 per cent of respondents to Germany’s University of Erfurt survey were willing to be vaccinated, while in September that number had dropped to 56 per cent. Last month, a YouGov poll suggested 32 per cent of Germans were immediately willing to be inoculated, while another 33 per cent wanted to see how the first round of vaccination went.In France, amid a slow rollout of the vaccination campaign, only 40 per cent of French people polled by Ipsos last week said they planned to be vaccinated, down from 54 per cent in October and 59 per cent in August.Despite the wariness, Dr Janssens said he believed the tide would turn among medics after the first round. “I am hopeful then others will follow. But it’s a very important signal that we need to give these people information now.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Megxit one year on: Was it a success story for the Sussexes?The  weekly news quiz: Which radio show did the Queen congratulate this week?Covid safety warning issued to 14 care homes in past fortnightBrexit red tape leaves fish rotting on Cornish boatsOrigins of dogs may lie in cavemen feeding excess meat to wolves at the end of the last Ice AgeFive dead in US Capitol riot after Donald Trump\u0026#39s supporters storm Washington - everything we know Coronavirus latest news: Pfizer vaccine effective against UK and South Africa strains, study suggestsUS Capitol riots: Donald Trump condemns \u0026#39mayhem\u0026#39 and commits to \u0026#39smooth transfer\u0026#39 - latest newsRadical cleric suspected of masterminding Bali bombings released early from jailSouth Korea court orders Japan to compensate \u0026#39comfort women\u0026#39 victimsPfizer vaccine works against new Covid mutations, drugmaker saysUS Capitol riots: Senate Sergeant-at-Arms resigns after \u0026#39serious failures\u0026#39 in Congress siegeRemove Donald Trump or we will: Democrat threat after America\u0026#39s day of shame\u0026#39This is insurrection\u0026#39: Joe Biden\u0026#39s speech in full as US Capitol is stormedProud Boys and neo-Nazis: Who are the protesters who stormed the US Capitol?What is the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and can it be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office?Jake Angeli: The \u0026#39QAnon shaman\u0026#39 from Arizona at the heart of the Capitol riots Washington stormed: How dark day for American democracy unfoldedAshli Babbitt: Air Force veteran shot dead by plain clothes police during US Capitol riotsInauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and could it be behind closed doors?School closures in Covid lockdown: latest news on when they could reopenBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"america proves precious uk elections","story":"It is unavoidably the case that any discussion about last November’s US elections becomes immediately mired in (unfounded) allegations of electoral fraud, with violent recriminations of the sort we witnessed on our TVs last evening.This is unfortunate, because the most important aspect of the 2020 race was its remarkable success. An accurate and fair election was organised across 50 states and attracted a record-breaking level of participation: 155 million people cast their votes – and all in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic.For Americans, the act of postponing legally-mandated elections is an almost unthinkable prospect, flying in the face of constitutional practice over nearly 250 years. In Britain, not so much. Here, local, regional and even national elections can be scheduled then rescheduled with hardly a voice raised in protest.In Scotland, for example, there was outrage when it sunk in that the coalition government’s commitment to the Fixed Term Parliaments Act meant that the next general election would fall on the same day as the planned Scottish Parliament elections of 2015. Immediately there was a general consensus that Scots, uniquely among the peoples of the globe, are incapable of choosing two sets of politicians on the same day. Your average Florida citizen may well be able to get his head round the task of electing a president, a governor, a senator, a congressman and a swathe of locally elected officials, including the country dog catcher, all on the same day – and that’s before he turns his attention to the inevitable local referendums he’s also asked to make a judgment on – but no, Scots being asked to elect an MP and an MSP on the same day was simply beyond us. Luckily, we weren’t being asked to chew gum as well. And so Holyrood, using powers that for some reason David Cameron saw fit to pass to it, did what all politicians instinctively do when given the chance: it gave itself an extra year in office. And not just for that parliamentary term, but for every parliamentary term to come.So it was inevitable that the stubborn nature of coronavirus would turn our national leaders’ minds towards a postponement of May’s planned elections, some of which have already been delayed from last year. So far, the thinking in Whitehall seems to be that they should go ahead as planned, but that the decision will be kept “under review”. Philip Cowley, the renowned psephologist (he studies elections) recognised this form of words for the alarm bell it represented, writing yesterday of his fears that, as per the British tradition, ministers will “insist that the elections go ahead, right up until the day that they are postponed”, a situation that would be entirely unsatisfactory and frustrating for all concerned.Yet, if 155 million people could cast their votes in America even as Covid-19 was laying waste to society, is it really beyond us to declare that local democracy is important enough for us to go ahead with elections and to put arrangements in place that will protect both democracy and voters? The government could start by insisting that every returning officer in the land makes arrangements now for a 100 per cent postal ballot in every area. Those who prefer to vote in person could be assured that this is a one-off event and that they can vote however they please in future. A nation that has acquiesced in demands for social distancing and mask-wearing will hardly cavil at having to fill out a ballot paper in the privacy of their own homes.The arrangements for Wales and Scotland are theirs to make but there is nothing stopping them following suit. As for the campaign itself, will democracy really be fatally wounded if we don’t get the chance to slam our doors in the faces of tired-looking canvassers of a cold Saturday morning? However many doors I knocked during my tenure as an MP – and they were many – the most common criticism even the most active campaigning MP gets from constituents is “Well, you’ve never been at my door.” So a campaign in which door-to-door canvassing is ditched entirely in favour of phone canvassing or electronic communications would surely be welcome by all.And since the vast majority of the information we get about our local candidates and parties is gleaned from other media – TV, wireless and the internet – and since traditional campaigning techniques such as face-to-face contact are a dying art anyway, the new arrangement would be seen as an inevitable, even welcome, development.Having said all that, I fully accept that I am in a small minority of people who believe that local democracy actually is important – too important, in fact, to allow it to become yet another victim of lockdown. And I am chronically aware that most of my fellow citizens could not give a flying fox about whether votes are counted this May and vacancies on local authorities, city halls, police and crime commissions and devolved assemblies are filled. And that’s precisely why these elections must go ahead. The less we as a nation care about local elections, the less value we place upon those institutions and the less important democracy itself becomes. As the awful scenes we witnessed in Washington DC last night illustrate, democracy can be a fragile thing. It requires nurturing and attention, otherwise it withers. All that is needed is some common sense and someone to take decisions sooner rather than later.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"americas adversaries revel us capitol storming","story":"America\u0027s adversaries were quick to pour scorn on the US over the storming of the Capitol building, declaring it to symbolise the decline of a once-great nation.In comments that mixed stinging criticism, glee and faux-concern, they said it demonstrated the perils of a US democratic system now in all-out crisis.America\u0027s arch-enemy Iran led the charge, with President Hassan Rouhani saying that that the rampage by of Donald Trump supporters exposed the dangerous populism of the outgoing US president.What we saw in the United States yesterday evening and today shows above all how fragile and vulnerable Western democracy is, Mr Rouhani said in a speech broadcast by state television.We saw that unfortunately the ground is fertile for populism, despite the advances in science and industry. A populist has arrived and he has led his country to disaster over these past four years.Mr Rouhani, who has been at loggerheads with Mr Trump after he pulled of Iran\u0027s international nuclear deal, also hinted that incident should be a wake-up call to incoming President Joe Biden, with whom he hopes for better relations. May they return to reason, legality and their obligations. It\u0027s for their own benefit and the good of the world, he said.In China, which has been the target of Mr Trump\u0027s trade war, the state-backed Global Times newspaper made gloatings comparison with the scenes of pro-democracy protesters storming the Hong Kong parliament in 2019.In a tweet directed at Nancy Pelosi, the US House of Representatives, the newspaper said:  @SpeakerPelosi once referred to the Hong Kong riots as a beautiful sight to behold — it remains yet to be seen whether she will say the same about the recent developments in Capitol Hill.China\u0027s US embassy also issued a note to Chinese citizens in the US to pay close attention to the local epidemic and security situation, be vigilant, take safety precautions and consider going to public places carefully.In Russia, officials compared the US scenes to those in Ukraine in 2014, when pro-Western democracy activists in Kiev\u0027s Maidan Square led protests that toppled the pro-Moscow president, Viktor Yanukovich.Quite Maidan-style pictures are coming from DC, said Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia\u0027s deputy UN Ambassador, in a post on Twitter.  He added: Some of my friends ask whether someone will distribute crackers to the protesters to echo Victoria Nuland stunt. He was referring to a 2013 visit to Ukraine when then-US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland offered food to protesters. Other US critics, such as the governments of Turkey and Venezuela - both of which have experienced major anti-government unrest themselves in recent years - took the opportunity to strike a statesmanlike pose.Jorge Arreaza, the foreign minister of Venezuela\u0027s, issued a statement expressing concern over the violence in Washington.But Dr Jonathan Eyal, an expert on global security issues at the Royal United Services Institute, said the violent scenes in Washington would offer only short-term political advantages to undemocratic regimes.The Chinese have a history of laughing at parliamentary democracy, seeing it as just chaos, and they have made direct comparisons with the scenes of demonstrators defacing the Hong Kong parliament, he said. But that\u0027s nonsense - in Hong Kong, it\u0027s people protesting for the actual right to vote, whereas in Washington it\u0027s people protesting a vote they didn\u0027t like.In the long-term, he said the incoming Biden administration could actually use the protests to enhance America\u0027s international standing as a democratic nation. One of the problems with America\u0027s democracy promotion agenda was that it always appeared so superior,” he said. “But if the Biden officials conduct themselves well, they can say to the world \u0027look, these problems can affect us all, and here is how we fix them\u0027. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"australia financial watchdog may have bungled claim mystery","story":"Australia\u0027s financial watchdog may have bungled its claim that the Vatican made mysterious transfers totalling £1.3bn to the country, announcing yesterday that it was “reviewing its calculations” after the Holy See said it was “stunned” by the report.  The agency, Austrac, said it is working alongside the Vatican’s financial watchdog to recalculate its data after the Vatican and Australian bishops questioned its December report that 47,000 transfers were made from Rome to Australia over six years ranging from £40.7m in 2014 to £332.7m in 2017.The data raised eyebrows in Australia and the Holy See, given the number of transfers and amounts that appeared to be greatly out of line with the Vatican\u0027s financial reality.It also fuelled media speculation that money from the Holy See helped influence the Australian criminal prosecution of Cardinal George Pell, who was convicted and then acquitted of historic sex abuse.Austrac listed the annual transactions since 2014 in response to a parliamentary inquiry without providing details about senders or recipients.The agency monitors financial transactions to identify money laundering, organised crime, tax evasion, welfare fraud and terrorism financing.The reported transfers have confused officials of the Holy See, the government of the Catholic Church, which has an annual budget of about £271m.That amount of money and that number of transfers did not leave the Vatican City, a senior Vatican official with knowledge of the city-state’s finances told Reuters last week.“It’s not our money because we don’t have that kind of money,” he said. “I am absolutely stunned.”The Vatican has one bank, with total client assets of £4.6bn. Two-thirds of those assets are held in managed portfolios that belong to the bank\u0027s 15,000 clients, most of them religious orders, Vatican employees, Holy See offices and embassies around the world.The official said its bank had sent less than £725,000 to Australia since 2014, mostly for payment of salaries and expenses for the Vatican embassy, as well as pensions and travel costs.“The Holy See’s entire yearly budget is about 330 million euros. The (Austrac) figures are about four times that,” the official said. “It seems like science fiction.”Australian Catholic Bishops Conference spokesman Gavin Abraham also said it had no knowledge of the transfers and that none of the money was received by dioceses, charities or other Catholic entities.Cardinal Pell, who was Pope Francis\u0027 former finance minister, had clashed with the Vatican\u0027s old guard over his financial reform efforts. He had to abandon his work in 2017 to face trial.Cardinal Pell himself has suggested that his prosecution was related to his work trying to clean up the Vatican\u0027s murky finances and the resistance he faced, but also acknowledged he has no evidence.Pope Francis welcomed Cardinal Pell back into the fold in October, granting the 79-year-old an audience when he returned to Rome after spending a year prison for his sex abuse conviction, which was ultimately overturned.Australia\u0027s police previously said they weren\u0027t investigating the money flows Cardinal Pell\u0027s accuser has denied receiving any payment for his testimony.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beloved republican party lies tatters must bear share blame","story":"Politics can create a strong sense of identity. I should know: growing up, a description of myself always included being Republican. The GOP was a party I learned about as a child, campaigned for after university and defended – abroad, no less – when it wasn’t often popular to do so. It was painful indeed to distance myself in 2016, when the values of the Republican nominee clashed too much with my own.But politics isn’t everything. Every election cycle, after the political wars subside, our American identity kicks into gear, and we remember that for all our differences, we are united in our commitment to freedom and democracy above all else. At least, that is what is supposed to happen.Wednesday’s violent scenes were an accumulation of the doubt and distrust the 45th president has been sewing into the fabric of American society since he took office four years ago – the undermining of American identity. This is Donald Trump’s America, where toxic party politics matter more than respect for fellow citizens.When Joe Biden addressed the nation after the Capitol was attacked, he called for unity in the nation, for the “true America” to shine through. He rightly pointed the finger of blame directly at those who caused havoc: the President and the mob. But let me, less charitably, add some culprits to the list: senior Republican party figures of late. The party has surrendered its most fervent commitment to the Constitution and rule of law in the space of one presidential term.It wasn’t long ago that Texas Senator Ted Cruz was labelling Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral”, when he was running against him in the Republican primaries in 2016. On Wednesday Cruz led the charge in Congress to cast doubt on the election, encouraging his colleagues not to certify certain results. The Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who has built his brand fast as a “constitutional conservative” (and spent a gap year teaching at St Paul’s school in London), sided with Trump’s version of election events over a Conservative-heavy Supreme Court. These men have contorted their constitutional positions to fit the President’s radical narrative, using every tool they can to usurp the power of the states, in direct contravention of the philosophy of limited government they otherwise preach. Meanwhile soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has always known the President “doesn’t know a lot about the issues”, as he put it in summer 2016, yet supported his refusal to concede in November, pandering to Trump\u0027s delusions about the election outcome for weeks.What changed? Four years ago Trump pulled off a spectacular win, bringing with him Republican control of Congress. Politicians and senior figures who had dedicated their working lives to the Republican party couldn’t resist this shiny new powerhouse, regardless of how shaky its foundation was, and so bowed down to a man who has shown himself to have little respect for the GOP or its history. The party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan openly embraced a man who demonised immigrants, attacked Muslims and Mexicans, demeaned women and mocked the disabled – all before he even entered the White House.In exchange for this temporary gain in power, far too many Republican politicians gave him everything: free passes for his dangerous remarks a promise to defend the indefensible. Most recently, they gifted the president free rein to spread conspiracy theories about voter fraud to his supporters. The consequences of this were laid bare this week.Not all Republicans gave in to the President’s tantrums and demands. Those traitorous “never-Trumpers” had the foresight to see the car crash coming. The list of dissenting elected officials has grown thin, but a few remain in office. Mitt Romney reportedly yelled at Cruz “this is what you’ve gotten” after the Capitol was stormed. When you spread hate among your supporters, hate is what they eventually give back.Where have these lies got us? That power, which Trump and the conquered Republicans sacrificed so much for, is in the hands of the Democrat party now. What remains is a Grand Old Party in tatters. It is a tragic sight – but responsibility cannot be shifted. It is a mess that must be fixed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day capitol invasion kim jong un frozen fish","story":" People enjoy the snow  in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, where the whole contry is on alert for Storm Filomena.

We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.The DfE also said that schools were expected to strongly encourage vulnerable children to attend class.Vulnerable children could include pupils who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home due to a lack of devices or a quiet space to study, according to the advice.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools. This means the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least February half term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news covid test holidays flights uk restrictions ban","story":"The rules will apply to all travellers except BritishIrish nationalsWhat a new national lockdown means for travelCan I go on holiday?New UK entry testing rules: Everything you need to knowWill cruise holidays make a comeback in 2021?Sign up to the  Travel newsletterThe Government is set to ban arrivals from a number of southern African countries, plus the Seychelles and Mauritius, amid fears of the new South African strain of Covid-19 spreading across the continent.All arrivals who have travelled to or transited through Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, eSwatini, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique, Angola, the Seychelles and Mauritius in the past ten days will be prohibited from entering the UK.The measure will be in place for a provisional two weeks, and apply to all travellers except BritishIrish nationals.Botswana, Mauritius and Seychelles will also be removed from the UK\u0027s travel corridor list from 4am on 9 January, along with Israel.This comes after the Government on December 23 banned entry for travellers who had been to, or transited through, South Africa in the previous ten days. All flights from South Africa are banned indefinitely.Aside from the new travel bans, the Government is due to make an announcement on testing arrivals. It is expected that anyone arriving in the UK will need to present a negative Covid-19 test result, taken 72 hours before travel.Scroll down for more of today\u0027s travel news. Before we sign off for the evening, here’s a quick recap of today’s top stories:UK travel ban for Southern Africa Britons warned of summer holiday shortage France indefinitely extends travel ban for passengers from UK  New UK entry rules could price millions of Brits out of holidays Jet2 launches its summer sale... for 2022 See you bright and early tomorrow for more travel news. We are expecting comment tonight from the Department for Transport, on the potential tightening of entry regulations at the UK borders.Every traveller coming into any UK port or airport will likely be expected to have a negative PCR test in order to enter the UK as part of a significant toughening of border controls.It may well cover all countries, including those with travel corridors under which people are currently exempted from quarantine on arrival in the UK.Travel agents are warning of rising holiday prices and an impending shortage of summer availability – caused by pent-up demand for future trips, and the many postponed bookings from last year.We’ve already seen an increase in bookings for this summer with Greece and Turkey currently being the most popular choices for customers, followed by the Balearic and Canary Islands, a TUI spokesperson told  Travel. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook reported an immediate jump in holiday bookings as soon as people finished work for Christmas.The UK\u0027s domestic travel industry has warned of limited availability this year. The pent-up demand for Easter through to 2022 is really high, said Alistair Handyside, Executive Chair of The Professional Association of Self-Caterers UK.Anyone who has not booked a holiday in the UK soon will be looking at the leftovers.Package holiday prices are largely driven by the cost of flights, says Craig Ashford, Director of Marketing at travel agency TravelUp – and as demand rises, so too will holiday prices, he warns. Airlines are trying to stimulate the market so there are some phenomenally low rates. As confidence returns the total number of airline seats will remain the same, so the cost will rise. My strong advice is to book now.Entry to the UK from multiple countries in South Africa will be prohibited, the Government has announced. The new rules will affect travellers from the Seychelles, Mauritius, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique, Angola and Eswatini. Botswana, Mauritius and the Seychelles will also be removed from the UK\u0027s travel corridor list.  After a student trip to Italy, Tishani Doshi resolved to stop ‘plodding along’ – and to become a poet: When we landed in Naples, I was struck by the feeling that I understood this place – I think partly because Italy has always reminded me of a sort of European India, which was where I grew up. You see the buildings with the clothes hanging outside, the bustling street corners, and there’s a nervous, exciting energy of life that’s outside and very vocal. This was in particular contrast to my experience in America, which I just didn’t understand, and where I felt lonely and far away.Read the full story.French PM Jean Castex has announced that the restrictions that are in place for travel from the UK will be extended indefinitely.This applies to all air, car, ferry and train passengers and was first introduced on December 20.As before, there are exceptions for French nationals, nationals of the European Area, British andor third country nationals who are habitually resident in France or must travel for essential reasons.Those that do have an exception to enter must also present a negative COVID-19 test result, carried out less than 72 hours before departure.We are poised to hear from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps soon, on any new updates to the UK\u0027s travel corridor list. More on this as soon as we have it.Portugal will decide next week on potential tougher restrictions that could amount to a new lockdown if its current surge in coronavirus infections continues, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said today.If the very likely evolution (of the pandemic) is confirmed next week, we will have to adopt more restrictive measures as it has happened in other European nations, Mr Costa told reporters after a government meeting.General confinement measures could be adopted.The daily tally of Covid-19 cases in the nation of around 10 million people hit a record 10,027 on Wednesday, putting increasing pressure on the health system.Santa: in demandThe tree is down, the tinsel is put away... and the January blues have arrived. If you think next Christmas can\u0027t come too soon, you\u0027re not alone: festive travel specialist Santa\u0027s Lapland says that 70 per cent of its 2021 trips are sold out already.So much so, it has launched Christmas trips for winter 2022 – a whole twelve months ahead of schedule.  Combined with the high numbers of people who chose to rebook for 2021 after their 2020 trips were suspended, we’ve seen great numbers filling our 2021 programme. So much so, that we are now 70 per cent booked for Christmas 2021 and now need to offer our customers the chance to book Santa’s Lapland holidays in 2022. We have increased the number of departure dates we’re offering, and put our 2022 programme on sale early.The last year has been incredibly hard for every accommodation business in the country – but you can help them recover, says Susan Briggs, founder of the Tourism Network. Her tips for more mindful, sustainable UK travel in 2021:Think before you review. All business owners have the same plea: speak to the manager or owner if something is wrong, before you become a keyboard warrior. Allow them to address in person any issues you may experience, and write your review with honesty. Don’t be a no-show: Every business owner recognises that sometimes you need to change arrangements, but they wish you’d do it in good time. No shows mean that businesses lose income twice – from the person not showing, and from those they’ve turned away.The Australian National Cabinet is set to pass increased measures on people travelling from the UK, in an attempt to contain the spread of the new coronavirus variant first identified in England. UK passengers will likely soon be required to undergo both pre-flight and post-flight rapid testing, which gives results in just minutes. These new measures would be in addition to the existing strict 14-day hotel quarantine. Passengers arriving from other countries will not be subject to the increased restrictions.Entry to Australia is currently restricted to just Australian citizens and permanent residents, or those with an exemption. Strict caps have been placed on the number of passengers who can arrive each week, leaving up to 40,000 Australians still stranded abroad. Signalling increased restrictions, Prime Minister Scott Robinson said this week: Getting Australians home is important but so is keeping Australians safe and ensuring the robustness of our processes and the quarantine arrangements, particularly with the additional risks that come with the more contagious strain.You’ve more chance of catching foot-and-mouth than Covid-19 in empty Lozère, says Anthony Peregrine: The traditional post-church tour of all the village bars gave way to a reception in the back room of a café. The posher hotel we’d reserved had double-booked. We lost. The young café-owners sprinkled far too much slipping powder on the dance-floor, so we sneezed through to dawn, and married life got off on the best possible footing. Ever since, I have felt attached to these wild uplands at the southern end of the Massif Central.Read the full story.Yes, prices will go up and hotels may become fully booked – but there\u0027s another reason to book your summer holiday sharpish. You deserve – nay, need – something to look forward to.So says Derek Moore, Deputy Chairman of AITO – The Specialist Travel Association. Suddenly the lockdown time can be put to good use reading about the places you want to head for, researching the new offerings from tour operators, and getting ready to book the minute you are confident to do so. Many feel that the research and the planning is half the fun of choosing a holiday – and, with light at the end of the tunnel, we now have the time to plan and to start dreaming again.”We\u0027ll just leave this here...Travellers could be hit with double testing charges this summerThe news that anyone travelling into the UK will soon be required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test has been welcomed by many who have been calling for increased border controls since the onset of the pandemic.However, concerns have been raised that the new UK testing requirements will mean families could be priced out of holidays once the national lockdown is lifted. Indeed, if strict entry measures continue into the summer, holidaymakers heading to the likes of France and Spain may need to pay for a private test before departure and secure a test before returning to the UK.As holidaymakers have found out this year, securing a Covid-19 test for travel is a costly endeavour. In the UK, private tests generally run from £80 up to £300 for same-day results. There is some hope that the cost could come down as testing infrastructure continues to grow and companies become more competitive with their pricing, but even still it could prove prohibitive to many families hoping to get away.  Holiday companies could potentially build the cost of a return test into holiday packages, but no operator has announced plans to do this yet.Emma Beaumont has the story.Mass business collapses could be on the way as almost three in ten hospitality businesses warn they have little chance of survival beyond the first quarter of 2021.Four in ten food services and accommodation businesses had temporarily ceased trading in the crucial fortnight before Christmas, the Office for National Statistics found, with Covid rules severely limiting their ability to operate in much of the country.As a result, more than three-quarters said turnover was down compared with their usual expectations for the period.Tim Wallace has the full story.The swim-up bar: first seen at SandalsSuch was the familiarity of the Godfather of Jamaican and Caribbean tourism that everyone simply called him ‘Butch’. Gordon ‘Butch’ Stewart, who died on January 4, was an affable man, ebullient and immensely energetic, a giant in the tourism industry who would talk to anyone. He was a salesman and a great communicator, for his businesses and for Jamaica, and his influence stretched throughout the Caribbean and beyond. Butch Stewart had humble beginnings, raised on Jamaica’s north coast, but he was an entrepreneur from the start, and caught the wave of several Caribbean industries. In the 1960s he set up his first company, distributing and servicing air conditioners, then becoming popular on the island.This carried him through the Seventies, a difficult political and economic period in Jamaica, and his success and energy left him poised to ride the Caribbean wave of mass tourism in the Eighties. In 1981 he bought a tired hotel in Montego Bay and re-opened it as a Sandals resort. His vision was clear – as James Henderson discovers.The first Eurosceptic?Brexit is about places as well as people, events as well as attitudes. And in decades to come, maybe tourists will explore the sites behind Britain’s historic decision.It might seem early to be planning a tour of Brexitland, but history books have already been published about the UK’s historic decision to leave the EU and, since we’re likely to be stuck on these islands a lot during 2021 (aka Brexit Year One), here’s a 21-stop tour – with free red, white and blue-badge guide blurb provided, as well as a seat on Big Red Bus no 350.Chris Moss is your guide.Can the cruise industry weather the coronavirus storm and recover? Leading cruise journalist, Jane Archer, tells The : “I think cruise holidays will bounce back quicker than many expect.”Tui, which was forced to postpone the launch of its new river line – first until November and then until spring – is now “looking forward to welcoming our first customers onboard in March and finally launching Tui River Cruises, after what has been a truly unprecedented time,” said Richard Sofer, the line’s commercial and business development director.Luxury river and ocean cruising specialist, Scenic, is another line “cautiously optimistic that 2021 will be the year the cruising industry will start to bounce back” revealed Sarah Lancashire, Scenic UK’s brand and marketing manager.Kaye Holland has the full story.In the middle of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, far from the laboratories of the world\u0027s major pharmaceutical companies, the Kayapó indigenous people of Para state are using a drink made from vines to help them ward off the worst effects of Covid-19.As incursions into the Amazon by illegal loggers and miners have increased during the pandemic, potentially exposing forest-dwelling tribes to the virus, the Kayapó say their natural treatment is helping to keep them safe.The skin of the vine - the name of which the community is keeping secret - is boiled and strained into a tea which is drunk three times a day, for five days, explained Po Yre, a 23-year-old member of the Kayapó community from Pykany village.It\u0026#39s not just the Kayapó tribe who are having to adapt to Covid-19, Amazon communities were particularly hard hit in the early stages of Brazil\u0026#39s coronavirus pandemic last year The medicine is very strong. When you take it, you get weak, sometimes with red eyes and a headache. But, the next day, it works. You wake up well, said Po Yre, who took the remedy after he tested positive for Covid-19 in July.While there is no scientific evidence that the tea can combat the virus, Kayapó leaders have said all community members should drink it as a form of prevention against Covid, which has killed nearly 200,000 Brazilians, according to official figures.Villagers say it is the best way to keep the pandemic from wiping out indigenous communities, which they say have had limited support from the federal government.Health experts warn that the coronavirus pandemic endangers indigenous communities with limited or no access to healthcare in the Amazon and whose communal living makes social distancing difficult.Ski resorts in France had hoped they would be able to open lifts, many for the first time this winter, today – but their hopes have been slashed, Lucy Aspden reports.Secretary of State for tourism Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne told AFP that in light of a rather steep rise in terms of new (Covid-19) cases and intensive care admissions, the French government has decided to push back the reopening date of the nation\u0027s lifts.Prime Minister Jean Castex and Health Minister Olivier Véran are set to hold a press conference today at 6pm to confirm the decision and it\u0027s safe to say resort bosses are not happy with the prolonged closure.An empty Chamrousse ski resort, near Grenoble in the Belledone range“The Christmas holidays proved that the mountain resorts were organized to welcome holidaymakers in total health security. The practice of an inidual outdoor sport such as skiing does not present any specific risk,” read a joint statement from Jean-Luc Boch, president of France Montagnes  and President of the National Association of Mayors of Mountain Stations, Alexandre Maulin, president of Domaines Skiables de France and Eric Brèche, president of the National Union of French Ski Instructors.“Winter tourism represents 120,000 direct jobs and 10 billion euros in turnover. Without openness, it is not only companies and employees who will suffer the consequences, but also all of life and the inhabitants of our mountain regions. The consequences of a lack of openness risk being the final and irreversible destruction of our economic model,” continues the statement.If lifts stand still into February ski resorts look set to lose huge amounts of revenue. Statistics from France Montagnes reveal ski holidays in February contribute 35 per cent of the winter’s income, making it the most lucrative month of the year.Ali Shah, CEO of holiday booking site TravelUp, believes the introduction of a pre-departure testing requirement for all UK arrivals is long overdue. He says:It is incomprehensible to me why some of the poorest countries in the world were extremely quick to introduce mandatory testing, whilst the UK continues to have some of the most lax measures. In December, the Government launched the Test to Release scheme, which allows travellers to end self-isolation early should they get a negative coronavirus test five days after arrival. However, the system has been a disaster. The Government did not even provide a list of approved testing companies until the day the programme was introduced. Taking a test is also expensive with costs ranging from £60 to over £200.The Prime Minister has been hinting this week that he may introduce testing for UK arrivals. He needs to get a move on and do it. This is not a time for delay. We need urgent action and we need a comprehensive testing programme in place as soon as possible. We need testing to be widely available and for it to be cheap if not free.This new lockdown could not have come at a worse time for the travel industry. We were just starting to see some optimism return to the travel sector with people encouraged by the vaccine roll-out. Families were slowly starting to book summer holidays again and things were looking up after many months of misery. Decisive action now from the government can help to preserve the future for travel.The summer sale comes earlier than ever before, amid strong demand from holidaymakers looking to book trips far in advance.Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2 and Jet2holidays, said: “After much uncertainty, the positive news about a vaccine coupled with a real desire to get away, means we are seeing strong demand from holidaymakers wanting to plan and book future holidays.As always, we respond to what our customers and independent travel agency partners are telling us, so we have put Summer 22 on sale from all ten of our UK bases, meaning we’re on sale with our summer programme earlier than ever before.With sunshine favourites on sale, the scale of our programme means there is plenty of choice and flexibility for customers and independent travel agents to choose from with our award-winning airline and tour operator.With more good news around the corner, we’re sure that our Summer 22 programme will be a huge hit with local holidaymakers looking to secure a much-needed holiday and give themselves something to look forward to.”Japan\u0027s government has declared a month-long coronavirus state of emergency in the greater Tokyo area as the capital reported another record surge in daily infections.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga described a great sense of crisis as he announced the measure, which begins Friday and is less strict than the harsh lockdowns seen elsewhere or even the country\u0027s first virus emergency last spring.It primarily targets restaurants and bars, which will be asked to stop serving alcohol by 7 pm and close an hour later.Shinjuku district in JapanSuga made a special appeal to young people to abide by the requests, saying that more than half of recent new infections in greater Tokyo were among the under-30s.Please act... in order to save precious lives of your parents, grandfathers, grandmothers and friends, he said.Tokyo recorded 2,447 new cases on Thursday - shattering the previous record of 1,591 logged a day earlier, and representing a sizeable chunk of the 7,490 new cases reported nationwide.Still, Japan\u0027s outbreak remains comparatively small, with around 3,700 deaths overall.Rising infections has seen Ireland leapfrog the UK to become the country with the third highest seven-day case rate. The Czech Republic, which was praised for its handling of the pandemic last spring only to be hit harder than the rest of Europe in winter, tops the table.The countries with the highest Covid infection rateThe Government is expected to review its quarantine-free travel corridor list at 5pm, the first update since December 21, and a couple of destinations appear at risk.Cases have risen in the UAE and Barbados in recent weeks, pushing their seven-day infection rates to 131.6 per 100,000 residents and 129.4, respectively. While the UK\u0027s own rate is far higher (607.5), it has previously ditched countries that crossed the 100 barrier.Holidays are not allowed under lockdown rules but any changes will affect those already abroad or needing to travel for essential reasons. It would also bode ill for the prospects of post-lockdown trips. National Express will fully suspend its national network of scheduled coach services with effect from 23:59 on Sunday 10 January.Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.All journeys before Monday 11 January will be completed to ensure any passengers making essential journeys are not stranded and customers who\u0027s all customers whose travel has been cancelled will be offered refunds or amendments to journeys.We plan to be back on the road as soon as the time is right and have put a provisional restart date of Monday 1 March in place, added Mr Hardy.“The whole team at National Express worked incredibly hard throughout 2020 and I want to thank them for their efforts as we pause our services. We will now make sure we are ready to get back behind the wheel as soon as the nation needs us again.” There have been a further 1,718 cases of coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 163,234.Public Health Wales reported another 63 deaths, taking the total in Wales since the start of the pandemic to 3,801.The agency said a total of 49,428 doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been given in Wales, including 25 second doses, as of the week ending January 3.This weekend the world’s skiing elite will take to the slopes of St Anton am Arlberg, Austria. But while there will be no human spectators to watch the Arlberg Kandahar races – which include the international FIS women’s downhill and super-G World Cup competitions – a crowd of snowmen has been constructed by local children, to add some atmosphere to the Karl Schranz stadium.All proceeds from the sponsored snowmen will go to charityThey\u0026#39ll enjoy a front-row view of the Arlberg Kandahar racesRace fans can choose to sponsor a snowman for €100, with all money raised going to the CARITAS relief campaign, a sustainable water project in Africa.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold a Downing Street press conference at 5pm, alongside NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens.As it\u0027s Thursday, we are also expecting an update from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on the UK\u0027s travel corridor list at 5pm. Though holidays are, of course, currently prohibited, any changes may impact essential travel – such as work trips and emergency journeys.Shapps usually announces any changes on his Twitter feed, but we\u0027ll have all the updates right here on the Travel Live Blog too.Hotelplan, which owns leading ski operators Inghams, Ski Total and Flexiski, has confirmed it is cancelling all ski holidays until after February 27.The group has already cancelled all holidays for the winter with its brand Esprit Ski.Following the announcement of new national lockdown restrictions, this week, we have sadly further suspended all Inghams, Ski Total and Flexiski holidays until after 27 February 2021,” said Joe Ponte, CEO of Hotelplan UK.  It’s still not clear when we will able to travel from the UK to European ski destinations, and understandably many people are eager to get back on the slopes. Our customers can remain assured that we are continuing to closely monitor the situation and when it is safe to do so, we will be ready to deliver the ski holidays people want.The move follows a similar decision by Crystal Ski Holidays, the UK’s biggest ski operator, which has suspended all trips up to and including February 12 – it is yet to make a decision on February half-term departures.What impact does the UK’s third national lockdown have on ski holidays? Our experts reveal all.Airline Aer Lingus is warning travellers from Britain and South Africa that those without a negative Covid-19 certificate will face a €2,500 fine or six months\u0027 imprisonment. The law will come into effect on January 9 – this Saturday. The airline\u0027s warning reads:All travellers are advised to check the requirements on the Government website.Holidaymakers arriving in Barbados may have to wear \u0027electronic tracking bracelets\u0027 until they are confirmed to be negative of Covid-19. This morning, the updated advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office reads: If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine.It is thought the measure would enable health authorities to check whether holidaymakers are adhering to their self-isolation requirements. Whether British skiers and snowboarders will be able to travel restriction- or quarantine-free to the French Alps this winter remains to be seen. Additionally, while ski resorts have been open for other activities since mid-December, a decision on whether ski lifts in France will be allowed to open, many for the first time this winter, is yet to be made, with an announcement due this evening. Despite the uncertainty surrounding what fate President Macron will cast on ski lifts later today many resorts are still hopeful that by the spring there will be a chance to make fresh tracks.Lucy Aspden has the latest.The Home Secretary Priti Patel has told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the UK Government will be announcing \u0027further action\u0027 regarding border restrictions imminently. Further action is going to take place, she told the programme. The Government is reviewing measures at the border... You will hear very shortly some of the changes that the Government will be proposing.Earlier this week, The  revealed that passengers would be prohibited from travelling to the UK without a negative Covid-19 test. However, the Government is yet to publish any details of its plans. We will, of course, have more on this story as it develops. Heathrow Airporthas reminded the public that \u0027only passengers undertaking essential travel may enter\u0027 its terminal buildings.That includes those who are travelling for essential reasons under the current lockdown legislation – as well as those offering care or assistance to travellers.Face coverings are also mandatory in terminal buildings, for all people over the age of 11. If you\u0027re thinking of booking a trip for later this year, take advantage of low flight prices while you still can, warns a spokesperson from travel agency Travelup: My strong advice is to book now, especially if you have a particular dream holiday or trip in mind. The prices can only go up. Once we are out of lockdown, the vaccine programme is rolled out more widely, and more travel corridors are opened up with testing, capacity is going to disappear pretty quickly. There is no point waiting to book nearer to departure time nowadays. Years ago there were low cost carriers, charters and scheduled airlines – and they were using different price matrixes. The low cost carriers would start off cheap and then get more expensive as you got closer to the departure date. The other airlines would reduce their prices to fill the empty seats. Now they all use the same model: they get more expensive. They all work on the basis that it’s the people who really need to travel who are booking so close to departure. So there is no point waiting any more.The boss of Norwegian Air has said the airline is \u0027fighting for survival\u0027 amid the coronavirus travel ban – with traffic down 94 per cent year-on-year. CEO  Jacob Schram said that just 130,000 passengers travelled on the airline in December 2020 – just 6 per cent of the passenger numbers in December 2019. The pandemic continues to have a negative impact on our business as it has had since March 2020, said Schram.At the beginning of last year, Norwegian was headed for a positive result in 2020 instead 2020, has been a very challenging year and we now find ourselves fighting for survival.The politan Police has said that officers will now be more inquisitive of people\u0027s behaviour and be quicker to act to engage rulebreakers. Police forces around the country would take similar approaches, Scotland Yard said.Over the past few weeks, officers have already turned long-distance day trippers away from beauty spots around the UK – including Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons. Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said that police resources were not limitless and officers continued to prioritise their work, adding that it was really, really important that people followed the Government guidance.Canada will end its ban on flights from the UK on Wednesday, Transport Minister Marc Garneau has announced.The ban on UK flights, which was going until midnight tonight will lapse. It will no longer be applicable, Garneau told a press conference. The country prohibited flights from the UK on December 20, amid concerns over the new variant of Covid-19. In place of the ban, Canada has announced that all incoming travellers will be required to test negative for coronavirus within 72 hours of boarding a flight before being allowed into the country.Travellers will still be required to quarantine for 14 days on arrival.Book your holiday now or face potential disappointment, is the message from the travel industry.

The PM told a press conference the Army will use “battle preparation techniques” to protect the UK’s most vulnerable by mid February. He introduced Brigadier Phil Prosser, the commander of military support for the vaccine, who said: “It is my role to deliver combat supplies to UK forces in time of war. “My team are used to building supply chains at speed in the most arduous and challenging conditions.” The rollout is the UK’s biggest logistical operation since the Second World War. Brigadier Prosser said the military used three steps in such complex operations. “First, we analyse the situation and the mission, we then identy choices to select the best plan, and then we execute that plan at pace,” he said. Hundreds of vaccination centres will open over the next week so there is one within  miles of every home. The aim is that every elderly care home resident will be offered their first dose by the end of the month. Operations are due to begin next week at the Etihad Tennis Centre in Manchester, Epsom Downs racecourse in Surrey, Robertson House in Stevenage, Ashton Gate Stadium in Bristol, Millennium Point in Birmingham and London ExCel. It is understood some care home workers are already receiving jabs at Newcastle’s Centre for Le. Mr Johnson said there will be “lumpiness and bumpiness” in the rollout, adding: “It will require an unprecedented national effort.” The Mirror, Labour and the TUC have launched a Let’s Vaccinate Britain campaign to encourage thousands to sign up as NHS volunteers.We also want them to get the jab and challenge anti-vax fake news. Almost .m people have had a jab but more than , need one every day to hit the target. Brig Prosser, Commander of the  Logistics Brigade, said: “I’ve found this operation unparalleled in scale and complexity, and I say this having served around the world. “In the  days this programme has been in operation we have delivered . million doses of vaccine, hundreds of millions of consumable items and established  sites.  “That’s the equivalent to setting up a major supermarket chain in less than a month, and next week we will further increase our footprint by another %.” Hospitals face bleak weeks ahead with , people admitted with Covid since Christmas. NHS England chief Simon Stevens said most were infected between Christmas and New Year when rules were relaxed. He said: “We’ve made a strong start on the vaccination programme but we need a huge acceleration over the next five weeks.” He slammed Covid deniers standing around outside hospitals.

Speaking to MPs, Mr Hancock talked about the four criteria that the government will look at before deciding on when they can end the lockdown.Ministers have said that they plan to end the lockdown in late February - but others, including Michael Gove,have suggested it could drag on into March.Mr Hancock told MPs: Weaposve set out the conditions that weaposll look at for the relaxation of the restrictions. Those are, that there isnapost another major, new iant that is causing dficulties. The vaccination program is working, and the number of hospitalisations and deaths is coming down.The Health Secretary said there were no fixed thresholds for any of the key criteria - but stressed ministers were always looking at the direction deaths and hospitalisations are travelling. The warning came as he insisted - despite the governmentaposs catalogue of errors - that this will be the last national lockdown.It came as Mr Hancock said people may need to be revaccinated every six months in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Mr Hancock said: “I anticipate we will probably need to revaccinate because we don’t know the longevity of the protection from these vaccines. “We don’t know how frequently it will be, but it might need to be every six months, it might need to be every year.” Askedhe thought this would be the “last of the lockdowns” because of the vaccines, Mr Hancock said: “I do, yes.” Mr Hancock also said that Covid- vaccines that require adjustments to fight new iants of the virus may not need to go through the usual full trials process. It came as Public Health England confirmed that case rates in England are rising among all age groups. The Health Secretary also warned that the number of people in hospitals may not fall as quickly as death rates once the vaccine is rolled out as a result of the number of younger adults with the virus. He said Hospitalisation levels I would also expect to fall, but ironically not as quickly as deaths in the first instance. “The reason is that people that are slightly younger spend longer in hospital, often because they survive when somebody who is very old and frail might not survive for as long.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no10 three press conferences week","story":"NewsNo to do three press conferences a week - but White House-style briefings delayedPlans to televise daily lobby briefings had been scheduled to start this month, led by the PMs new press secretary Allegra StrattonmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN NewsRegular No press conferences willnext week\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He said that as pressure on the NHS grows “it is more stretched in delivering the services that people need” and pointed to the cancelling of routine elective procedures in the second peak. Askedhe has faith that the health service in London will be able to cope, he said: “Well, yes, I’m sure that the NHS is going to do everything that it possibly can to ensure that everybody gets the care that they need.” Mr Hancock said critical care capacity had been extended over the summer in the capital and reiterated that the Nightingale is on stand-by.

And while  per cent simply shared their thoughts with their partner, a third talked about holidays with anyone who would listen.All manner of holiday-related topics are usually explored, including the weather , what they would eatand even what they would pack .It also emerged that while going away on holiday is normally the highlight of the year for  per cent of adults, just  per cent have their next getaway booked. A spokesperson for Jetholidays, which commissioned the research, said: With many of us stuck at home, weaposve been thinking about holidays more than usual - whether thataposs reminiscing about past adventures or thinking about the next one. Thereaposs no better feeling than having that all-important holiday booked, as it gives us a real boost and gives us something to look forward to. The study also found that in addition to chatting about holidays past, present and future, those polled will also enjoy watching  travel TV shows a year. And theyaposll share holiday-related content on social media  times during that sameperiod of time, while  per cent follow travel bloggers on the likes of Twitter and Instagram.Aside from getting inspiration from social media and television programmes,  per cent get holiday ideas from their friends, while  per cent like to scan through travel guides. Further to this,  per cent love planning getaways so much itaposs one of the aspects of holidays they enjoy the most.  The Jetholidays study, carried out via OnePoll, also found  per cent aposliveapos for going on holiday.

This week the mum of a young baby has warned other parents to be on the lookout for symptoms which can be mistaken for ailments of a common sickness bug or teething in tots. Myer Rudelhoff said her four-month-old son George spent three nights in Basildon Hospital in Essex after suffering from vomiting, patchy skin, swelling lips and a high temperature. The poorly tot also struggled to keep fluids down. Myer said: He got so poorly so quickly when we arrived and was really lethargic. They took a swab and, when they said he was positive, I burst into tears. It was such a shock. Nurses treating George said nurses told her they had treated multiple children with the same mottled skin and sickness before encouraging her to share her story to warn other parents.  Lucy Fisher, from Hertford, also shared photos of her -month-old son Albie with mottled skin after he tested positive for the virus. Images of Albie show the youngsteraposs mottled skin, with his neck flushed and covered in a rash. Another photograph shows a teary-looking Lucy with Albie cuddled into her chest sleeping.The -year-old listed her sonaposs symptoms in a Facebook post on Monday [ Jan] as a warning to other parents, saying: “This is without a doubt the hardest week I’ve faced being a mum. Last month, Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app and Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, said as a new strain of the virus causes a spike in infections across the country people should not just focus on the three main symptoms and look for other signs.He said: Testing alone is not going to stop the spread, just as it didn’t with the previous waves. People need to know all the symptoms and not just focus on the three “official” symptoms that miss over  per cent of cases . If anyone is suffering from any of theseover the coming weeks, stay at home, self isolate and get a test. Stomach ache The American Journal of Gastroenterology published a study suggesting the virus could cause digestive problems such as diarrhoea. It analysed data from  patients in China, discovering that . per cent of them had tummy issues such as vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea when they were first hospitalised. Teenager Daraposyana Dyson, from Maryland, Baltimore, US, died from a coronavirus-related inflammatory condition after suffering an upset stomach alongside other symptoms.The -year-oldaposs mum Kandace Knight told WBAL-TV : It happened so fast. I never thought that taking my daughter to the hospital for a stomach pain that I wouldnapost be walking out of there with her. She was so beautul, she was too good for this world. Eye infections Health officials think conjunctivitis develops in around % to % of patients, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Chy Earnest, a nurse at the Le Care Centre in Washington, said that red eyes are the ‘single most important’ sign that patients have COVID-. Speaking to CNN she explained: “They have, like...allergy eyes. The white part of the eye is not red. Itaposs more like they have red eye shadow on the outside of their eyes.” However, the American Academy of Ophthalmology said this does not mean you should panicyou see someone with apospink eyeapos. FatigueA WHO study looking at common signs found that the third most common symptom of coronavirus was a aposflatliningapos feeling of fatigue. Some . per cent of patients reported the symptom in the study, which was based on , laboratory confirmed cases.Researchers previously described fatigue as one of the aposdark horses of Covid symptomsapos, alongside headaches.Using data from the COVID Symptom Study app, the researchers created a list of the most common symptoms reported by patients in the first seven days after onset.  Brain fog aposBrain fogapos is usually a symptom associated with aposlong Covidapos but some patients also experience it before being diagnosed with the disease.Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache.The mum-of-three said: I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep, while trying to keep the kids safe and away from my quarantine area — my bedroom. Dr Hilary Jones said those who do experience the side-effect will be faced with a crippling inability to think clearly. Confusion Dr Halim Fadil, a neurologist at Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital, told Healthline : “Many COVID- patients have been reported to have neurological symptoms, such as headache, confusion, seizures, and even strokes.”Delirium usually affects patients who require ventilator support, and is caused by a build-up of carbon dioxide in the body. Neurologist Dr Kevin Conner explained: “Patients with delirium may have auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, disorientation of time and space, agitation, aggression, fluctuating level of consciousness, and impairment of sleep-wake cycle.” Worryingly, delirium can lead to long-term brain damage, while patients who experience it are also less likely to survive, according to the experts.  Skipping mealsProfessor Spector said data from the Covid Symptom Tracker App has revealed that the top five symptoms in children aged under  who tested positive for the virus are headaches, fatigue, fever, sore throat and skipping meals.Speaking on BBC Inside Science, Prof Spector said: These are dferent from the top five we see in adults which includes generally the cough and the shortness of breath and the loss of smell. That’s really important to realise - skipping meals and fatigue are really important, as are headaches.s. Prof Spector has encouraged parents to sign up to the app on behalf of their children.  Muscle pain New York University researchers found a link between sore muscles and serious coronavirus cases during an analysis of  patients in Wenzhou, China. Professor Megan Coffee, the infectious-disease expert who led the study, said deep muscle soreness, known as myalgia, were often exhibited by patients. The World Health Organization said aches or joint pain came up in around  per cent of coronavirus patients. The soreness is caused by chemicals called cytokines being released into the body in response to the infection, according to The Sun.

Sky Diamonds are created by sucking carbon out of the atmosphere which gets turned into eye-catching stones. And theyaposre proving a huge hit with shoppers looking for green gts because they have zero impact on the planet - unlike the mining of traditional diamonds. The idea is the brainchild of clean energy entrepreneur Dale Vince OBE, who founded the worldaposs first green energy company, Ecotricity, back in . Discussing the topic in his new book, Manesto, Dale explains how the incredible process took several years to perfect. He writes: Sometimes pushing the boundaries is not enough, we need a new paradigm. Henry Ford said, before he made cars -he’d asked his customers what they wanted, they would have said ‘faster horses’.To create the Green Industrial Revolution we need to do old things in new ways - and in some cases just let go of what know. Living a green lestyle isn’t about giving things up, it’s about doing them dferently. Whether we’re talking burgers, cars or football - and now diamonds.Some years ago, I was thinking about the concept of geoengineering - how to extract carbon from the atmosphere. That led me to think about how to store that carbon, and to the simple thought that the most permanent, enduring form of carbon – the toughest of all – is a diamond.  I wonderedit might be possible to take carbon out of the atmosphere and turn it into diamonds. I loved the idea, and not just as an environmentalist it’s radical and evocative – it’s modern day alchemy. So we pursued it. It took few years but we’ve done it. We’re making diamonds from atmospheric carbon.

The Witham mum was told by doctors her lung cancer had spread to her liver and bones, giving her a matter of just months.With England now in lockdown, many of Avaaposs children and grandchildren are unable to be with her and hold her hand during what little time she has left, reports Essex Live.Are you separated from someone you love due to the coronavirus crisis  Share your experience in the comments below...Three of Avaaposs six children have been able to self-isolate to spend time with their mum. But the others, who work in the community, are only able to see their mum through the window. The whole family and little ones are desperate to be able to cuddle Ava and give her the best few months they possibly can. It was just six weeks before Christmas when Ava was rushed into Broomfield Hospital. A series of scans revealed that Ava had cancer in the lungs, which had spread to her liver and bones, making it incurable. The news devastated the entire family, one of Avaaposs daughters, Katy Richardson, said. She was in hospital over Christmas and we have been told at the moment that itaposs a case of months but whether that is three, six or nine months we still donapost know, Katy, , said. Itaposs the symptoms of the bone cancer that has been causing the most problems. She had to have a hip replacement because the cancer was crumbling at the bone.  They rushed her in for the operation and that gave us hope because they hadnapost written her off. Ava is due to start radiotherapy next week and will be going into hospital every day for treatment. Thankfully, Katy was able to self-isolate to go and live with her mum during her treatment, while her other siblings do what they can to support their mum from afar. Katy said: We were heartbroken when we found out. She is the matriarch of the family, I am one of six children.  And you think of all our friends too - she has been a second mum to a lot of people. To see her on this journey now, we donapost want to see her go through this. Sheaposs done nothing but help other people. Sheaposs kind, sheaposs caring, it is limitless what she will do for other people. The family has now set up a fundraiser to try and give Ava the opportunity to make as many amazing memories as she can once restrictions lt. Seeing the amazing comments and donations have meant the world to Ava - finally putting her first for a change. Katy added: Thataposs the reason we set up the GoFundMe because so many people have asked what can they do to help and this way we can give people the opportunity to do that. Sheaposs never been in that position where she has had extra money to enjoy herself. She lives alone and we just thoughtpeople want to help this is the way I feel. We can take away the financial burden and she can go make memories and allow her that freedom once restrictions go.  For the three of Avaaposs children, Sam, , Ella, , and Callum, , as well as her ten grandchildren, it is incredibly dficult to not be able to be close to her during this time. Those who canapost isolate because they are working in the community are the ones are doing the shopping and the other three of us are isolating to be with her, she said. Without a pandemic, we wouldnapost have to worry about any of this, Katy said. My sister has a new baby coming on the way too and my mum is so desperate she wants to be there for the baby. Itaposs awful to be so close but so far all you want to do is hold her hand and have a cuddle. She added: The grandkids absolutely love her, they get really sad looking at the window through to her because they have to stay at the window. She is desperate for a cuddle but when we are allowed to do things it will give her the fire in her belly. Ava is also due to turn -years-old in May with the hope that they can plan a big party to celebrate together. Lucy, one of her daughters, is also due to get married in August this year, which her family pray Ava will be able to be a part of. While Katy said her mum is starting to come to terms with the diagnosis, the comments and donations from people whose lives she has touched mean so much. This has put her in higher spirits seeing the amazing comments and that means the world to her, she said. Even just buying the babies an ice cream, silly little things like that are lovely for her to do. We want a huge family holiday too - five years ago we had one and paid for her and it would be a dream for us to do that again, she loves Greece. My mum has always been the provider, when we went on picnics before lockdown, there would be  of us and she would have so much joy in doing the food and buying it all for everyone. She loves giving. Itaposs all the little things in le that mean something to her. Katy said they have already exceeded fundraising more than they would ever think, with nearly £, donated. They are so grateful to anyone who is able to donate or share words of support for Ava and hope she can make as new and wonderful memories soon.

Parents who work in key worker sectors are permitted to send their children to school - while all others have been told to keep children to engage in remote learning. However, some parents and teachers have claimed schools are dramatically busier than the first closure during lockdown one earlier this year. Some key workers have said they have even been denied a place for the child as classrooms fill up during the UKaposs third lockdown.Victoria Pass told the Manchester Evening News said: I’m a frontline NHS worker and been declined by my child’s school. Now I’m questioning whether to go to work or stay at home and not help save lives because my children need me.A teaching assistant has also been refused spaces for her children because her partner isnapost a key worker, yet he still has to work - leaving her unable to teach at her own school. While mental health worker Ewa Fcia said her son didnapost get a place at school because she works remotely from home - but sheaposs unable to do whataposs required when heaposs there. I work in mental health in the NHS. As it’s not physical health I work remotely from home, she said. Because I work from home my son didn’t get a place in school. However, it is not possible to do any kind of therapy with anyone with a four-year-old at home as he will interrupt any appointments that I will have via video link with patients. I will struggle to see patients as I normally do now. How is that protecting NHS services  Others spoke of how much busier schools are compared with the last lockdown, with some now choosing to keep them home because of the numbers. Among them is Katie Cowley, a teacher who lives in Rochdale, who said some parents at her childrenaposs school had been outside apostalking about what a lovely day they have had at home with no childrenapos.  She said: I was amazed at the amount of children in when I dropped mine off. As a teacher myself I have no choice but to send them in, I am genuinely worried for their safety and may now decide not to send them in, I am so worried for them and myself. aposI donapost need full time provision, there are times when I could keep my children at home and successfully fulfil my duties as a teacher and parent, but to access that provision I have to send mine in full time. Kirsty Frances is also concerned over the number of children, saying: I work in school kitchens and have to put both my kids in school so I can be in work. Iaposve seen my childrenaposs school have to turn people away already but thereaposs far too many kids already in. And Jo Harrow said she hoped schools were checking for proof of key worker status. I hope to god schools are asking for letters from employers to ensure they are genuine, she said. I know my sonaposs school had a number of people taking advantage last time and it’s not fair. The increase in demand is in part due to an expansion of the list of critical workers and vulnerable children entitled to a space.For example, the aposvulnerable children and young peopleapos list now includes aposthose who may have dficulty engaging with remote education at home apos. Teaching unions today raised concerns, with one heads’ union reporting that some schools have had  per cent of their families requesting on-site provision. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders’ union NAHT, said: We’re increasingly concerned about the sheer demand for key worker and vulnerable pupil places this week. Our members are telling us that demand for places is much higher than it was during the first lockdown last spring. We’ve heard stories of some schools having - per cent in. This could seriously undermine the impact of lockdown measures, and may even run the risk of extending school closures.” Another mum suggested that perhaps parents wouldnapost be so keen to send their children to schoolthey were happy with the remote learning being provided - something thataposs proved somewhat of a lottery for families depending on what their childaposs school is offering.  Catherine Ibison said: Maybe because they know the effect that this is having on their children’s education and they want them to be taught. Not to be given an online class on a mobile app that they have to work from PowerPoint on with no teacher availablethey get stuck. I wonder how many teachers have tested this and see the end user experience . She added: How have all schools not adapted for true virtual learning by now when they have had  months to nail it ! Why have some schools not embraced Zoom and only using it for assembly and not classes. Maybe that’s the reason! Sort the virtual learning out and more parents may have the confidence that their children are indeed getting an education! The issue was raised at Mayor Andy Burnhamaposs weekly press conference on Wednesday. Asked whether he supported the decision of some schools to limit spaces to children with two key worker parents, he said schools need to be trusted to make their own judgements.

Detectives labelled it a aposdisgusting assaultapos as the Government ramps up its vaccine rollout for the UKaposs most at-risk people. Elderly and clinically vulnerable are at the front of the queue for the Covid- jab as authorities race to vaccinate nearly million people by mid-February.

She told police he said he was from the NHS and there to vaccinate her. The victim allowed the man inside her home and was jabbed in the arm with what she described as a ‘dart-like implement,’ she told officers.

Katy Toft, , from Newton-le-Willows on Merseyside, tipped the scales at st lbs at her heaviest. The mum gorged McDonaldaposs meals on the school run and snacks of crisps, chocolate and biscuits.But determined to lose weight in time for her wedding following the birth of her fourth child, Katy signed up to a diet plan, reports the Liverpool Echo.Do you have an incredible weight loss success story with before and after pictures  Email webnews@mirror After starting the : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan, she lost an incredible three stone within just three months of starting it back in October , and went on to lose another stone during lockdown in time for her birthday in June. This takes her weight loss to four stone in total after she slimmed down to st lb and went from a size   to a size  . Katy said she now feels healthy, happy and content and she was able to enjoy her big day in October  with husband Martyn at St Peters Church. Katy said: Iaposd just had my fourth baby and I was dreading the thought of walking down the aisle feeling uncomfortable about myself in front of all my friends and family. I felt really unhealthy, I couldnapost walk upstairs without getting out of breath.  I couldnapost keep up with my children and I didnapost want to be a bad example for them. Because it went on through Covid crisis it was massively for health reasons, because when your BMI is really high you are at risk of all types of illnesses like type two diabetes and heart problems. Katy said she had previously lost some weight after giving birth to her third child but after splitting up from her partner and getting into a new relationship, everything snow balled. Katy said: It was convenience - I was eating fast food and portions that were too big. I wouldnapost just have two slices of toast I would have four slices of toast. We live really close to a McDonaldaposs and we would nip into that on the school run. If someone asked for a biscuit I would have a biscuit. Iaposve got four children and two step children. If six children are coming up to me saying aposI want a biscuitapos I had six biscuits. Eight months after the birth of her fourth child after she had stopped breast feeding, Katy signed up to the : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan. She started the diet on an intake of  calories a day, swapping three meals with meal replacements provided by the plan. Katy said: The lowest calorie intake is  calories depending on your BMI. I started on  calories. It was full meal replacements that are nutritionally balanced with every single thing you need in a day. You have shakes, soups, for breakfast you have porridge and you have other meal replacements. Itaposs massively motivating when you see the results coming quickly as well. I lost three stone in three months then I hit a bit of a brick wall with the pandemic. Then I lost another stone before my th birthday.  Katy said the thing sheaposs enjoyed most about the plan is the one to one support she has received from consultants and she has since signed up to become a consultant herself to inspire others with their weight loss. I wanted to feel like the best version of myself. I donapost feel self conscious when I go clothes shopping anymore and I donapost struggle to tie my shoe laces. I used to get out of breath tying my shoe laces - things as ridiculous as that, Katy added. I donapost feel like that now - Iaposm healthy, happy and content. We had to bring our wedding day forward because of the next lockdown. When I took back on pictures I know the smiles are genuine - I just couldnapost believe it was me.  Everything had was such a whirlwind any way but everything was worth it in that moment, when I put on my wedding dress and walked down the stairs and saw my familyaposs faces. The national lockdown in England is expected to last until mid-February at the earliest and Katy said the next six weeks are the perfect time for people to lose weightthey want to.

Itaposs been a really tough year for him. Most people make adjustments to their lives slowly but for him everything just went at once. A source close to the couple apparently reveals how they feel one year on from telling the world they were leaving royal le. Meghan and Harry took a huge leap of faith to embark on their new le, the source told the magazine. The year started out with a lot of excitement and anticipation. Harry was finally doing what he’d wanted to do for years, and to have Meghan and Archie with him was all he could have asked for.  The insider added: Despite everything that has been going on this year, they don’t regret their move to the US they love that they are able to focus on projects and causes that are important to them. Harry and Meghan left the UK back in March, just as the coronavirus pandemic started to affect the country.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their plans to step back as senior royals, last year saying they wanted to become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. After a showdown at Sandringham it was made clear, Harry would not be able to pick and choose his royal duties and would have to choose all or nothing. The pair left the UK for the US and later secretly moved into a secluded mansion  minutes from Los Angeles with the help of Prince Charles and are now neighbours to Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres.

The strain has since spread overseas, and is believed to be signicantly more virulent than the original iant. Its  dferent mutations is thought to make it up to  per cent more infectious as well as more transmittable by children. It originally began being detected in the south east and London, where infection rates began ramping up rapidly, before spreading everywhere  in the UK. Experts and vaccine developers have insisted the new strain is unlikely to be resistant to Covid- jabs. The UK is in a race against time to vaccinate million of the most vulnerable in the population by February .  Boris Johnson put the country on a war footing on Thursday as he promised the British Army would help speed up the vaccine programme, delivering aposhundreds of thousandsapos of doses a day. NHS Chief Sir Simon Stevens told the Downing Street press conference speed was essential as patient admissions increased at the rate of a full hospital a day. And earlier in the week, the governmentaposs chief science advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned that it was essential the vaccine march continued apace.  Sir Patrick explained the longer the virus was in circulation, the more opportunity it had to mutate further. The World Health Organisation has since confirmed the origins of the iant now being described abroad as the aposUK strainapos - revealing the first sample of the new mutant strain was discovered in Kent on September . Data from the Covid- Genomics UK Consortium shows a key sample was found in a location near Canterbury. Kent Live has confirmed this location relates to information provided by public health agencies about where the patient lived rather than the location of a hospital or lab. Experts also believe the new strain may have been created by mutating inside an immuno-suppressed person over a long period of time. This means they had a reduced ability to fight off infections and other diseases, normally because of their own condition or illness, such as AIDS or cancer. Dr Jeffrey Barrett, Director of the SARS-CoV- Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: There’s another case in London from September, so B...was present in both places early.  We don’t know exactly how many cases there were in each place in the early days.  He added: “There have been a number of reports of inidual patients who have prolonged illness, and in whom a similar pattern of mutations to B...arose. So there is a hypothesis that an event like this might have been the origin. Some, but not all, of these patients are immunosuppressed. It does seem like B... is the first example of a new iant arising in this way that went on to circulate widely.  Experts believe the first signicant outbreak was in Kent, followed by Medway. It is then thought to have spread through the London boroughs of Bexley, Greenwich and Havering, before hitting other parts of London and Essex. The speed of increase in cases caused by the new Covid- iant is a key reason touted for tougher restrictions introduced in recent weeks.  Public Health England has said the Government only realised the scale of the problem when cases continued to rise in Kent and Medway in November, despite the national lockdown in place at the time. Speaking on December , the epidemiologist Susan Hopkins said: Towards the end of November it was clear that the Kent and Medway region of the country in particular was going against the tide of the national restrictions and was seeing increases, whereas by November  almost all other parts of the country started to decline.” Ms Hopkins explained an initial review looked at whether this increase in Kent was linked to any particular group in the population or workplace outbreaks.  When this proved not to be the case, Public Health England reviewed the genomic epidemiology to look for changes. Ms Hopkins said: “On December  they found that there was a particular iant that had some mutations in the spike protein that had emerged quite rapidly and was spreading not only in the south east but also in parts of London. “So over the following  hours they rapidly undertook an investigation looking at the phylogenetic tree and the clinical details of the patients in which the cases had arisen.

The image of a Big Issue seller dressed in a Santa outfit popped-up on a corner in Hyde Parks, Leeds. Charlie Simionescu-Marin, a student from Leeds University, believes it is  very potentially a Banksy. There has been no confirmation that the art artwork on the corner of Pearson Avenue and Brudenell Road was created by the elusive Bristol artist, but Charlie has his suspicions, reports Leeds Live. It would not be the first time Banksyaposs art has popped up in a dferent UK city. Banksyaposs usual method of revealing his work is by posting on his official Instagram account - but he has not yet posted anything about this particular painting. Charlie said: I assumed it was Banksy as the stylistic approach is similar – stencil clearly used, colours and shadows very detailed, makes a reference to societal issues. Poignantly the graffiti depicts Santa Claus as a Big Issue distributor this is a job usually given to help homeless people get some form of wage and is quite striking in this respect. Of course with everything that’s going on right now it seems a bit of a hint to the fact that in these circumstances even those who are seemingly omnipotent may fall into redundancy.  Possibly also a take on the Rethink. Reskill. Reboot. campaign by gov earlier this year as, like artists etc, his is a job that brings joy to the masses. Charlie added: My assumption that it was a Banksy is based off the fact that another one of his recent pieces was on the end of my friends’ road, Rothesay Avenue, in Nottingham’s student area.

Aware of the signicance of her symptoms, she arranged to have a Covid- test at the local testing station, which duly ed positive. A few days later, her fiancé Alan James started to get similar symptoms, and he too then tested positive. “I thought we were quite lucky at the time because when Bonnie was ill, I was able to look after Jack, who is only seven months old, and then when I became ill, she was on the mend so she was able to be with him,” said Mr James, a lecturer at Coleg Sir Gâr in Carmarthenshire. “We both had the same symptoms - cough, temperature, flu-like symptoms - but the kids were all OK. They didn’t show any symptoms so we thought it would all pass without a problem. “But then, on January , Jack fell ill.” Mr James, who lives in Carmarthen, thought everything would be fine and that baby Jack would not contract the virus, or at leasthe did, he would be able to bounce back from it quickly, like children often do with a range of illnesses. “It was obvious before he was tested that it was the virus,” said Mr James. “His temperature was raging and he had a cough, and obviously he had been around the both of us who had tested positive. We arranged for him to be tested and it came back positive.  “The usual painkiller medicines were doing the trick in terms of keeping his temperature OK and his behaviour and general mood was quite normal so we kept him at home. But then on Monday night he started to wheeze heavily and he was really struggling to breathe. He was gasping for air. “We rung the ambulance and they came out and took him to hospital. We don’t live that far from the hospital but because all three of us had Covid, and because of the seriousness of Jack’s situation, we phoned . “I had never rung  before, and it’s not a nice experience because you’re dealing with a real emergency - I found that it’s really dficult to concentrate when you’re panicking.” Jack was put in the ambulance and his mother Bonnie was allowed to go with him to hospital, where he was treated with steroids and given oxygen to help him breathe. He was kept in all day and allowed home when his condition improved on Tuesday night. Mr James said his son was now “on the mend” but his recovery might take some time, along with his own. His partneraposs recuperation has been quicker, perhaps owing to the fact that she has already received the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. “Bonnie, as part of her job, was given the first dose of the Covid- vaccine a few weeks ago, and she is due to have the second dose in due course. “So, obviously, she caught coronavirus after being vaccinated but her symptoms were far milder than mine and Jack’s. Whether that’s the reason, I don’t know. “He’s on the mend but it’s quite slow. It’s not like he has a cold as such, and he’s not snfling, he’s just very lethargic and not himself, and he has a throaty cough. As for me, it’s been a week since I became ill and I’m still rough now. I consider myself to be reasonably fit and I don’t get ill often, but this has really knocked me back. I remember having the flu a few years ago but this is dferent. It hits you in the chest and just leaves you with no energy.” He added: “I thought he would be OK because you don’t often hear of young children having it, or becoming ill with it, so the message always seems to be that young people don’t really get affected by coronavirus. “Because of what I had read I was more concerned about Bonnie or myself getting it, so it was really shocking to see how it took hold of Jack and just how rapidly he went down with it. “It just happened really quickly - the coughing, the temperature, and then the wheezing and the struggling to breathe.

But how much do you really know about it  New book Very British Weather - Over  Hidden Wonders from the World’s Greatest Forecasters, The Met Office - will make you a weather whizz in no time... Can it be too cold to snow  You sometimes hear people say that it is too cold to snow, but can that actually ever be the case  Strictly speaking, the answer is no, but it can be too dry to snow, and the colder air is, the drier it tends to be because cold air holds less water vapour than warmer air. At -°C, air’s capacity to hold moisture is only % that of air at freezing point. But even the coldest air observed near the Earth’s surface can hold some moisture. So, in theory it can’t be too cold to snow, but the colder the air is, the less likely it is that ice crystals will precipitate out and form into flakes to fall to Earth as snow. Shepherd’s delight Clouds are an invaluable source of information when it comes to forecasting the weather, and not just for trained meteorologists. People throughout history have used cloud formations in particular to predict the weather.One of the most famous examples from folklore is the saying ‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight. Red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’, which dates to biblical times. But is there any scientic basis to it  The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the west, as they do in the UK.  A red sky appears when dust and small particles are trapped in the atmosphere by high pressure. This scatters blue light, leaving only red light to give the sky its notable appearance. Because high pressure moving in from the west is generally an indicator of good weather approaching, a red sky at night means that the next day will usually be dry and pleasant. A red sky in the morning tends to indicate that the high-pressure weather system has already moved east and the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a wet and windy low-pressure system later in the day.So, a red sky at night, or in the morning, can be helpful in working out what weather is to come, but it’s still worth checking the Met Office forecast before you head out without a brolly .The longest-lasting rainbow The longest-lasting rainbow in the UK was observed in Sheffield on  March  – it was visible for approximately  hours, from am to pm. This stood as the global record until it was surpassed by a rainbow in Taiwan that persisted for  hours and  minutes on  November .  Who Needs a Thermometer When You’ve Got a Cricket  Did you know that the sound of crickets chirping on a warm summer evening can tell you what temperature it is  The frequency of a cricket’s chirps is affected by air temperature, soyou count the number of chirps you hear over a period of  seconds then ide by  and add , you will arrive at an approximate temperature in Celsius. Britain’s biggest soaking The wettest day recorded in Britain was  December  when Honister Pass in Cumbria recorded . millimetres of rain in a single day, the result of Storm Desmond, which brought widespread heavy rain and storm-force winds to areas of Scotland and northern England. The same rainfall event also saw the highest accumulations ever recorded in Britain for a two-day period , recorded nearby in Thirlmere. The volume of rain that falls across Scotland in an average year is enough to fill Loch Ness, the largest lake by volume in the UK, more than  times over.  The volume of rain that falls across Northern Ireland in an average year is enough to fill Lough Neagh, the largest lake by area in the UK, around four and a half times. And the volume of rain that falls across England on an average day is enough to fill the Royal Albert Hall almost , times. Britain’s longest icicle Although the s of icicles are not officially recorded, one discovered on a bridge over the River Spey in Grantown, Inverness-shire, must have a good claim to being Britain’s longest ever. It was thought that water from a leaking pipe in the bridge was the source of the mammoth icicles, the longest of which grew to approximately . metres.  Raining Fish Despite the well-known saying, it has never actually rained cats and dogs in the UK, but it has, believe it or not, rained fish before. In , a shower of fish was recorded in Cranstead, Kent. And this was not a one-off event: in , fresh herring fell on fields on Islay in the Hebrides, and in February , dozens of fish fell in Mountain Ash, South Wales. The likely explanation is that waterspouts or tornadoes crossing bodies of water picked up the fish before depositing them again on the ground, much to the confusion of any onlookers.  Does lightning strike twice  Contrary to the popular saying, lightning does often strike more than once. The Empire State Building in New York is struck by lightning on average  times each year and was once struck eight times in  minutes. Closer to home, The Shard in London, the tallest building in Europe, was struck multiple times during a particularly ferocious storm on  May . How much does a cloud weigh  While there are many factors that will determine the exact amount of water a cloud can hold – including temperature, altitude and pressure – we can work with an estimate of about . grams of water per cubic metre in an average cumulus cloud. This means an average-sized cumulus would weigh about , kilograms, roughly the same as an Airbus A.  How extreme do we get in the UK  The highest temperature on record in the UK is .C, recorded in Cambridge in , and the lowest is -.C, recorded in Braemar in Scotland on  February  and  January , as well as at Altnaharra, also in Scotland, on  December . This is the equivalent of .C between the two extremes. Unusual rainbows . Moonbows form at night using light from the moon instead of the sun. The physics are the same as rainbows but, since the moon is less bright and since our eyes are less sensitive to colour at night, moonbows tend to be much less colourful.They are relatively rare, since they need a bright moon and also because showers are less common at night. . Monochrome rainbows occur at sunset or sunrise, the sunbeam has to travel through a larger slice of atmosphere at these times of day.The blue and green components of the sun’s white light are dispersed by the thicker atmosphere and the rainbow is instead dominated by reds and oranges. . Double rainbows occur when sunlight bounces around a raindrop not once but twice. The colours that make up the outer rainbow will be reversed compared to the colours of the inner rainbow.It’s even possible to see a triple rainbow, but each additional rainbow will appear fainter than the last.  . Fire rainbows form when sunlight is refracted through ice crystals in high cirrus clouds also known as upside-down rainbows, or circumhorizontal arcs – their technical name. They often appear high in the sky as quarter-circle rainbows, which is why they are sometimes referred to as ‘smiles in the sky’.How to build the best snowman So, wet snow is best for building a snowman, but surely all snow is made of water, so how can it be wetter or drier  One way to classy how wet snow is is not by how much water would be producedit melted but instead by how much free water it contains relative to the number of ice crystals – the less free water, the drier the snow: Water content in snow Dry: % water Moist: less than % water Wet:  to % water Very wet:  to % water Slush: more than % water Dry snow doesn’t stick together as well, and slush doesn’t hold its shape, so moist to wet snow is best for snowman building.  When it is colder, more water vapour freezes into ice crystals and produces drier snow, meaning that temperatures around or just above °C at ground level are ideal. When actually constructing your snowman, it is also helpful to pack the snow as tightly as possible, as this causes it to melt slightly and then refreeze into ice crystals, binding it together.

Kindness demands courage.” The words were said to me by Ozlem Cekic, a former MP in the Danish Parliament, who after years of daily abuse and death threats simply for being a Muslim in public le, began meeting her aggressors for coffee. Kindness may seem a strange thing to talk about at this dangerous moment. But how we respond matters more now, perhaps, than ever. Anarchy in the USA wasn’t an end point in a culture war, but a flash point in tensions building across the world. The Trump riot was in itself repolarising. We are hurt. We are angry. We want to say we told you so. Born in Ankara, Turkey, Ozlem Cekic came to Denmark as a child of Kurdish immigrants, overcoming tough odds to become an MP in the Socialist People’s Party.What do you think of her idea  Share your views in the comments below...Denmark’s first Muslim MP, she began keeping her racist hatemail to help the police when someone finally hurt her. But in  she started looking through them. “There were hundreds of them,” she says. “Emails that started with words like terrorist, rat, whore.” One signature appeared more than others – ‘Ingolf’. Ozlem looked him up in the phone directory, and to her shock he answered the phone. “I blurted out, ‘Hello, my name is Ozlem’,” she says. “‘You’ve sent me so many hate mails. You don’t know me. I don’t know you. I was wonderingI could come round, and we can drink a coffee and talk about it’.” Ingolf’s reply shocked her. “I have to ask my we.” Ozlem’s decision to go to visit Ingolf for the Danish institution of ‘coffee and cake’ – while her husband sat at home waiting to ring the policeshe did not– changed her le. “All my assumptions were challenged,” she says. “I was disappointed because I thought he would have a dirty, messy house. He had the same coffee set as my parents. “We had so many more things in common. Even our prejudices were alike. When the bus stopped  metres from me, I thought it was because the driver was a racist. Ingolf thought it was because the driver was a Muslim.” The result was that eight years ago, Ozlem started something called ‘Dialogue Coffee’ – regularly visiting trolls and haters and talking to them. Often these visits were terrying. One man, who had already confessed he thought rape was the fault of the victim, asked ‘ we were naked, would something happen ’ just as she looked up at a display of  kitchen knives. “I said to him, ‘I’m frightened, should I be ’ My question genuinely shocked him. ‘I would never dream of harming you’, he said. ‘I was the one frightened of you. I thought you would be bringing your Muslim cousins to smash up my house’. “We were the same age, we spoke the same language, we were from the same community, but we were afraid of each other.” These visits became the basis for a Ted Talk, and then a book published this month, Overcoming Hate Through Dialogue. “ We think we are the ‘good’ people,” she smiles. “We think the ‘monsters’ have to change. We think they have to come to me, but we must meet them on the bridge.” She adds: “No one ever became less racist by being called a racist.” Ozlem began to admit she had also hated people. As a teenager she flirted with ideas of extremism after being on the receiving end of a hateful act. “I was walking wearing a headscarf when a Danish man spat in my face. I couldn’t bring myself to remove the slime. I started vomiting violently. “I hated him and all the other Danes. I decided all Danish people are racist.” This was one of hundreds of acts of racism. She also held prejudices against Jewish people. “When I was a child, I had seen footage of terrible things in Palestine. A Jewish girl started at my school. She asked me to play basketball. I thought, I can’t play basketball with a Jewish girl when I support the Palestinian people.” One day, the girl invited her for lunch. “I found out I could eat everything at her house. There was no pork.” Ozlem now considers herself an adopted part of the Jewish community in Denmark. “This friendship vaccinated me against anti-semitism.”  Her fear and hatred of Danes ended when she got a job at a supermarket after school. “My boss was so nice. It was dficult to say she was racist. “I thought then that she must be the one Dane left in Denmark who isn’t racist. Then I kissed a guy who wasn’t racist.” Again, she found herself vaccinated against a prejudice by kindness. Ozlem admits that some of the hardest bridges to build are at home. “Dialogue Coffee is easier with people you don’t know,” she laughs.  Her father voted for right-wing nationalist President Erdogan in Turkey. “I am on a blacklist in Turkey because I criticised Erdogan.”  She watched the recent elections with her dad, neither of them speaking. “Eventually my father said, ‘we won’. I said: ‘We didn’t. We couldn’t talk about what we saw on the TV. So, in fact, we lose together’.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/SNS-19245359-Dundee-United-vs.-Dundee_32253708-e1609932046458-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united transfer news cammy smith exit january","story":"Cammy Smith is set to leave Dundee United at the end of January when his contract expires.The -year-old attacker, who has spent the last few months on loan at Championship Ayr United, is headed for the Tannadice exit door at the end of the winter window after two years with the club.Former Aberdeen and St Mirren man Smith struggled for game time under new boss Micky Mellon in the Premiership and made only  appearances in his second spell with the Terrors following half a season on loan in  .He scored nine goals in  games over his two stints with the Tangerines, the most memorable for Arabs being the sixth in their - derby win over Dundee on their way to the Championship title last term.Smith also spent time on loan at Irish side Dundalk at the start of last year and has scored three goals in nine games for Ayr, so far, this season.Smith will be on the lookout for a new club and, speaking late last year, United loans manager Brian Grant said they would be working on an ‘exit strategy’ for the forward.Paul McMullan: Dundee have made their move to secure Dundee United ace on pre-contract deal\" title\"#Paul McMullan: Dundee have made their move to secure Dundee United ace on pre-contract deal# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp breaking-dundee-make-move-for-dundee-united-winger-paul-mcmullan embed # secretrnxJTTQbf\" data-secret\"rnxJTTQbf\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/12/Gjen-Jim-McLean-fans-tannadice_37361934-558x372.jpg ","title":"jim mclean dundee united tributes st johnstone","story":"Dundee United have announced a series of tributes to Jim McLean ahead of their first home match since the death of the club’s greatest ever manager.McLean – who guided the Tangerines to the league title and made them a force in Europe – passed away on Boxing Day at the age of  following a battle with dementia.United opened an online book of condolences as a mark of respect, with Micky Mellon and his first-team players observing a minute’s silence and wearing black armbands at games against Celtic and Aberdeen.And for Saturday’s visit of St Johnstone, the Tannadice side have produced a special -page limited edition match-day programme in memory of McLean, with proceeds going to Alzheimer Scotland.A share of the pay-per-view revenue from the match will also go towards the charity after United’s partners Stream Digital waived their fees for the fixture.Tangerines stars will wear tribute t-shirts during the warm-up while there will be a minute’s applause before the game and during it – the second one in the rd minute, a nod to the club’s  title triumph under the legendary boss.United said: “Our first home game of  has us ing to our home stadium to celebrate the le and Tannadice career of Jim McLean.“With the permission and wishes of the McLean family we will honour and celebrate Jim’s impact on Dundee United in a number of ways and will donate revenues from these projects towards Alzheimer Scotland.”The Scottish Premiership outfit have also set a Just Giving page in McLean’s name to fundraise for Alzheimer Scotland.Jim Pearson, the charity’s director of policy and research, said: “Alzheimer Scotland are deeply saddened by the passing of football legend, Jim McLean and send our sincerest sympathies to his family and all who knew him.“We are honoured to be a beneficiary of a fund being set up in Jim’s name.“Alzheimer Scotland’s mission is to make sure nobody faces dementia alone.“This has never been so important as during the coronavirus pandemic, which has had such a signicant impact on our dementia community.“The support from this fund will help us continue to be there for people with dementia and their families and carers across Scotland.#We are proud of our much-valued ongoing relationship with Dundee United Football Club, through the Football Memories Project and continued fundraising initiatives.“This work is making a real and direct impact to the lives of so many people in Scotland living with dementia, as well as their families and friends.“We must say thank you to the McLean family, as well as the Dundee United Football Club and Community Trust.“If you, or anyone you know, would like information or emotional support our -hour Freephone Dementia Helpline is here for you.

open to shoppers by April .Aldi says the move will generate up to  jobs, and represent an investment of more than £. million into the area.The Germany-headquartered firm has opened a public consultation on its proposals, seeking feedback from locals ahead of it filing any formal planning applications.Details will be formally lodged with Aberdeen City Council in the coming months.According to the plans, the ,sq ft supermarket will have  parking spaces and #improve the range and quality of shopping available# to those in Altens, Kincorth, Cove and Torry.It is proposed for the site of oil firm Amec Foster Wheeler#s former offices, which are currently being demolished after lying empty since .A statement from Aldi said: #The proposals would see a new, modern food store development to serve residents living within the south of Aberdeen, including the communities of Altens,#The development will also help regenerate a high-profile site that has lain vacant for a number of years, delivering both investment and jobs to the local area.#The supermarket chain is preparing to open a new store in nearby Portlethen this year.And in September, planning permission was granted for an Aldi supermarket in Countesswells.Scottish Conservative north-east MSP Liam Kerr said: “It’s extremely positive to see plans for a new Aldi supermarket in Altens during such a dficult period caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“Job creation is absolutely vital and these proposals will provide a welcome boost to residents living in areas such as Altens, Cove, Kincorth and Torry.“It’s important everything is done to show Aberdeen remains open for business despite the challenging circumstances that have been faced over the last year.“The south side of the city is continuing to develop and it’s great to see businesses wanting to invest in the area.”Kincorth, Nigg and Cove councillor Alex Nicoll said: #As local residents are aware the area continues to be built out and the provision of additional services is necessary.#I am sure the local community will welcome the provision of an additional choice of supermarket to serve the area.#The plans can be viewed in detail at:

at the bar as owners push again to find buyer","story":"The chiming of the bells at Hogmanay have also rung in big changes at one north-east hotel, with its owners pushing ahead with plans to retire.Even once coronavirus restrictions are eased, Cuminestown#s only public bar will remain closed to regulars, as the Commercial Hotel shuts to all but residents.The part-closure comes almost two years after owners Kenny and Eleanor Duncan put the six-bedroom Auchry Road hotel, bar and restaurant on the market for £,.Mrs Duncan, , says the hotel is proving too much for her and her -year-old husband, Kenneth, who still works full time as a manager with Lovie#s Quarries.#We are closing down the bars but will still open as a hotel,# she said.#That#s been the case since the level four restrictions were imposed, but it was always intended to be a permanent move once the new year came in.#We are hoping to retire as it#s just too much for us now. In  years we have taken it from nothing and built it up, spending about £, on renovations.#We bought it later in le as an investment but our family decided to go their own way.#Neither the couple#s son, daughter, six grandchildren or six great-grandchildren are in a position to take it on, meaning Mr and Mrs Duncan, originally from New Pitsligo and Fraserburgh respectively, have no choice but to make the heartbreaking decision to sell-up upon retiring.The hotel bar has been home to Turrf Accordian and Fiddle Club and the village#s darts, poker and pensioners# clubs over the years, but will only host residents until a buyer is found.#We have loved every minute of running the place and meeting those we have met,# Mrs Duncan added.#We#ve had to let the clubs know so they can find somewhere .#It#s a shame. It makes you want to cry really, but it#s just too much for us.#The pub is the central focus of the village. People are really upset but we can#t keep it going. We have to put our health first.#She says the hotel is #many businesses in one# and offers plenty of potential for new buyers.It includes ahall that can hold up to  people for weddings, a smaller reception area for about  people, a dining room, six-bedrooms and a live-in flat for those at the helm.#There has been a lot of interest from young couples and locals but they are either frightened to invest in this current climate or struggling to secure the funds,# Mrs Duncan added.#The place is many businesses in one. It could be a wedding reception venue, bed and breakfast, just a restaurant or takeaway#it#s a big place.#The car park alone could host a taxi service.#Most of the hotel#s staff are furloughed at the moment, but on wedding days it can employ up to  workers.#It is still profitable despite Covid,# Mrs Duncan added.#It#s a real shame to seegoing from so busy to nothing, though.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

These additional consumers will need more food while Scotland’s multial land can also meet, at the same time, the growing demand for a range of goods and services that hits targets on climate change, the environment, renewable energy, bioersity, and the wider and hugely important rural economy.#To move forward urgently, let us identy all the means and mechanisms we can put in place.  Let us have credibility for farmers by investing in bioeconomy, bioenergy, agro-forestry, precision farming, and shorter food chains – support for which is within the Government’s gt.#NFUS has been promoting our industry as one that can change to meet public goods for public money requirements, with an upbeat forward-looking mindset. This outlook will empower our farmers and crofters and drive us forward to the holy grail of sustainable profit with all the environmental, welfare and standards the public expect as thefor their investment and support for our industry.#In , the black cloud of COVID- needs swept away, a process driven by the vaccines that our scientists have developed, and lessons learned on the things we should do better but also how we have adapted and adopted new methods for good.#People should be more accepting of others’ views with ambition to work collaboratively for mutual benefit. There is a belief binary tribalism is ‘the norm’ and the use of social media to promulgate the “yer either for us or agin us” culture is acceptable. It is not hard being considerate and kind.#Agriculture also urgently needs delivery of an ambitious coherent policy delivering a sustainable profitable industry that addresses climate change, bioersity and an increasing demand for nutritious high standard and welfare food. Procrastination has a price.#Brexit will go by, like foot and mouth, the oil crisis, and the great depression, but we need enough freedom and flexibility to be able to innovate and chose our own paths through it as well.#We need to throw open our doors to the public and build trust on what we do and how we do it. There is huge potential from selling our story both on farm and in the food chain. We also need to encourage more ersity in our industry across the piece it can and will add value both financially and culturally.#To quote Shihab Kazi: #The moment you need to get started is called #now#.##I wish everyone health wealth and happiness for the coming year.#"},{"url":null,"title":"golf club responds to covid restrictions","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online. It will bring to le an exciting new piece of writing by award-winning poet and Scots Makar, Jackie Kay, creating Scotlandrsquos first-ever large-scale drone show and the largest drone show ever seen in the UK.Around  drones will create iconic images and words in the Scottish sky set to original words and music by Jackie Kay and Skyersquos Niteworks.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

A raised bed can be an ideal solution for this.\"Get them involved from the beginning by adding personalised signs and finding out what they would like to grow.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash. However, it typically scored highly for occupant protection in a iety of crash scenarios, as well as for having an emergency call system."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12198206.jpg?type=article-full","title":"graphic-content-michel-rabagliati-drawing-life","story":"And yet, downbeat as its subject matter is, Paul at Home is also full of sweetness, good humour and gorgeous cartooning.Here, Rabagliati talks about fictionalising le, dealing with the pandemic and his love of typography :Can we start by asking how much of yourself, Michel, is in Paul  Do you dfer in any way at all Paul is very close to me, I would say % me in terms of his personality, and % me in terms of the things that happen to him ndash the le events.

I was too caught up in my own small le to pay attention to her when I was young, which is a shame.At the same time is there a consolation in putting these events down on the page To be honest, I was sort of looking for redemption or healing to come out of writing this book. But I just never felt that! This book was dficult to make ndash it caused me a lot of sorrow. It was a trap for all my emotions.

Many will often view Scotland as nicely wrapped within a lovely box, tied with a charming tartan bow. Of course, such a positive view is not harmful, in fact, it can be beneficial.What is lacking in America is a depth of understanding about Scotland as an innovative, entrepreneurial, and progressive nation. The Biden Administration is listening and seems to understand the gt Scotland offers the world is so much more profound than to simply view it and the Scottish people as merely delightful.First Minister Sturgeon, numerous Scottish ministers and MPs representing Scotland have made important connections with U.S. leaders over the years and reinforced this message.One excellent connection the FM Sturgeon made was with then Deputy Secretary of State Blinken. It is valuable that Scotland and the United States have an existing relationship between the FM and the future Secretary of State on which to build.The U.S. Government would be wise to expand its presence in Scotland for strategic and economic reasons. Currently, the U.S. has one Foreign Service Officer based in Edinburgh who serves effectively in the U.S. Consulate as Principal Officer.A new U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. should make a tactical stroke to relocate a handful of commercial, political, and economic officer positions from London to cover regions across Scotland. Doing so will signicantly enrich the ambassadorrsquos knowledge as an advisor to President Biden and Secretary Blinken.The ambassador would better comprehend the political and economic dynamics in the U.K. and Europe, position the U.S. for the COP in Glasgow, improve the grasp of understanding of the U.S. Scottish trading relationship, and aid in forging more partnerships between U.S. and Scottish entities across sectors.Further, with a wider tactical presence, U.S. leaders will see how Scotland is leveraging sectors and offering a policy blueprint for other nations, businesses, and communities when it comes to hydrogen and net-zero policy, tech innovation, inclusion, wind-power, healthcare, human rights, le sciences, and caring for vulnerable populations.While these are dficult budget times in Scotland with an historic need to prioritize caring for those impacted by the pandemic, a fundamental international question is on the table. Should Scotland commit more resources to widen strategic relationships throughout the United States  The Scottish Office within the British Embassy in Washington, DC continues to do outstanding work.

Scotland must find a way to build on a strong existing foundation and invest more into scaling up in the U.S. Doing so will secure tangible benefits for Scottish enterprise, culture, trade, tourism, research, and academia at a key moment.A fresh foreign policy vision by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the incoming team for Europe and beyond offers an opportunity for the United States and Scotland to forge modern links. Scotland can build on its own lsquospecial relationshiprsquo with the United States by launching a more assertive, strategic, and creative plan backed with more capacity building resources. And as the United States develops a renewed global approach, it can enlarge its footprint in Scotland while fully respecting and expanding its key connection with the U.K. A deeper partnership between Scotland and the U.S. is not only mutually beneficial, but valuable for the U.K., Europe, and the larger global community.Ian Houston has spent his career in Washington, DC as an international non-profit leader, a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation, and intercultural dialogue.

Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest.

Although the population of the UAEs cosmopolitan city is largely expatriate, foreigners were still subject to strict laws.

An independent Scotlandrsquos relationship with the European Union would be the most consequential decision of its future foreign policy. Small states such as Finland, Denmark, or Ireland all put the EU centre stage in their international policies. And, as the UK will find, leaving the gravitational pull of the EU is challenging indeed.It could be argued that the Scottish Government goal of independence in the EU should be Scotlandrsquos longer term aim. For now, Scotland might benefit from letting the new EU-UK relationship, however problematic, settle in. Setting up a new state will take time, not least the challenges of currency and managing the fiscal deficit in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. And a dferent UK government might move back closer to the EU, changing the implications for independence.Some argue that Europe is not so important in independence debates, or suggest a transition over time via the European Economic Arealike Norway, or even favour a more Brexit-like Scexit where an independent Scotland is in neither the EU nor EEA.Yet such hesitancy may mean missing the EU boat. Awareness of Scotlandrsquos pro-remain vote is currently high across the EU. But interest in Scotlandrsquos independence debate ies: itrsquos followed more in Berlin or the Hague than in Prague or Budapest. The EU has many other more important priorities to contend with.Still, the upcoming Holyrood elections, alongside the new EU-UK deal, are also prompting substantial interest from EU media as to the prospects for Scottish independence. And EU political figures are fully aware that a fragmentation of the UK is possible.The political challenge for the pro-independence side is how to build on and dynamise these current levels of awareness and sympathy. EU member state governments will stay neutral on the constitutional question. But there are plenty of politicians, not least in the European parliament , who insist that an independent Scotland would be welcome back in the EU. Even where governments, such as in France, Spain or the Netherlands, are concerned at the prospect of a disintegrating UK, there are opportunities to engage positively with their publics ndash as the UKrsquos baffling and self-harming lsquoglobal Britainrsquo sets sail.But European politics moves on. A Scottish rejection of the UKrsquos new post-Brexit trajectory is likely to have more salience, impact and support in the coming period thanit waits a decade. By , the new EU-UK relationship will probably have settled down. Upsetting and recasting it might look more problematic then, whereas an independence referendum in , for instance, would look like another unfolding, and eminently understandable, consequence of Brexit.This is where those who caution against speed may be mistaken. Itrsquos conceivable thatScotland chose independence in , it could re-join the EU ahead of the western Balkan candidates. Certainly, dferent EU opinion-formers see Scottish accession as much more straightforward, technically and politically. While the Scottish debate obsesses around currency and deficits, many EU observers see in Scotland a country that spent  years in the EU, is still aligned to EU rules, and is a stable, ing democracy .But the independence debate needs to be alert to how it looks from the EU. And those who want a Scexit outside both the EU and EEA should explain the very dficult economics of that isolationist position. Nor does the simplistic dismissal of the EUrsquos single market as neoliberal, unfettered capitalism match the reality of the tough social and environmental level-playing field conditions that are in the EU-UK deal.Those who prefer the Norway approach need to ask themselves why no other country since  has chosen to join the EEA rather than the EU. It creates a major democratic deficit ndash a strange choice for a newly independent state, and in the case of Norway only happened after its public rejected the negotiated EU accession terms.Nor is the EEA a transitional route to the EU rather it might be taken as a signal of lack of interest. If Scotland wanted to re-join the EU that would need to be clear upfront after an independence vote. A candidate country usually agrees a specic association agreement with the EU, with the added plus of also unleashing both political support and financial assistance.Independence in the EU will certainly mean a hard border between England  Wales and Scotland . But the UKrsquos brave new world on the edge of the EU will give much insight into the implications of that border and likely costs and benefits for Scotland.All of this assumes, of course, that there is a legal, constitutionally valid referendum, including clear political agreement between London and Edinburgh. The rather inward-looking debate around lsquoplan Brsquo tends to ignore the fact that some plan Bs may be a hard sell in the EU. It might also be wise, in terms of future EU understanding, to put more emphasis on why Boris Johnson should allow a referendumthe SNP win a majority in May, rather than already weakening the impact of his potential lsquonorsquo by saying itrsquos expected.The EU choice is not a side issue in the independence debate. It would determine the type of independent state Scotland would be: one that works with others, at the table, to influence EU choices, or one that sits it out on the sidelines. Striking while the iron is hot might provoke a more positive and welcoming European dynamic than a debate that is overly inward-looking and cautious.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It claims that the government failed to assess the impact of applying the new law \"on the need to advance equality betweenwomenand men, or consider the need to foster good relations\".The group has decided to launch legal action after Scottish Ministers informed them earlier this year that it believed that it was able to amend the legislation as it was lsquowithin legislative and devolved competencersquo.On Thursday, Mr OrsquoNeill,forthe petitioners, told the court that the Equality Act contains ldquoprotected characteristics.He said that one of these characteristics protects people against sex discrimination.The Equality Act defines sex as being either male or female, or a group of people like men or boys, orwomenor girls.Mr OrsquoNeill also said that the case law on sex discrimination definedwomenon the basis of unique biological features - such as fertility.He said that another protected characteristic under the act isfortrans people who face discrimination.Mr OrsquoNeill said the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals to help trans people gain greater representation on public boards undermined the rightswomenhad under the Equality Act.He added: ldquoWhat has happened in this case is the assumption is made that born men who have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment are equivalent to bornwomenwho do not have the characteristic and who are dferent in terms of social issues , economically and in terms of representation.ldquoThatrsquos the assumption which has been made without examination and we see that when we look at the underlying consultations and discussions - the presumption which has been made - there has never been any examination of it - there has never been a factual look which says - lsquolook we have this group - born men - who have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. lsquoIsnrsquot it interesting our research has shown that they are in the exactly same position as bornwomenwho do not have the protected characteristic of gender reassignmentforthe purposes of representation as non executive members on public boards.rsquoldquoTherefore we are going to use exactly the same measuresforthem by combining them into this new definition which we will happen to callforconveniencewomenrsquoldquoBut we have to be clear as to what our groups are and we have to work that out.

Loganair has recruited and trained engineers locally to take over from retiring long-serving members of its team and is committed to continuing this policy of local investment in Orkney wherever it possibly can. During the new contract, Loganair has said it fully expects to convert the aircraft to use low-carbon propulsion to replace the same type of conventional piston engine which has powered the services for over  years.

Similar openness should apply to new bodies like the Joint Biosecurity Centre.ldquoThere is nothing to fear from openness. The more transparent data, analysis and conclusions drawn are, the better it is for policy making and for public confidence.ldquoThe Government should disclose the assessment it makes of the impact of measures it is considering on livelihoods, education and wellbeing as it now does with epidemiological analysis.ldquoThis will be especially important when ministers eventually weigh choices of when it is appropriate to begin to lt the current restrictions.The report, The UK Response To Covid-: Use of Scientic Advice, said the advice on the type of measures required to get a grip on infections, along with those behind it, had been ldquoopaque.ldquoMeasures taken to contain the pandemic had wider and indirect effects such as on peoplersquos livelihoods, educational progress and mental and emotional wellbeing, the cross-party group of MPs said.ldquoThe assessment of these wider impacts was ndash and remains ndash much less transparent than the epidemiological analysis the people conducting the analysis and giving advice are less visible than epidemiological modelling advisers and its role in decision making opaque.The committee praised the use of scientic evidence and the quality of advice on offer but said there were lessons to be learnt from the UKrsquos performance in the first wave, especially over why more was not learnt from other countriesrsquo experiences.The UK emerged from  with one of the highest Covid- death rates in Europe.MPs also said that the increase in testing capacity that took place from April, when it was promised to have capacity to test , people per day, was largely driven by Health Secretary Matt Hancock rather than ldquofollowing a scientically-based plan of what capacity was needed.The committee is due to hold an evidence session on vaccine rollout on Wednesday January .copy -.

Reducing the pressure caused by seasonal flu will help protect our health service and save lives.”Minister Swann continued: “This week has also seen GP practices begin the first phase in the Covid- population vaccination programme.

Under the NI Protocol, companies sending parcels here have to complete customs declarations. While a three-month grace period is in force, it was not announced until shortly before the protocol began to apply at pm last Thursday.But freight boss Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK dismissed a call by North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley that the protocol should be dropped.Other problems including snarl-ups at ports in Great Britain for lorries carrying food to Northern Ireland were discussed at a hearing of the NI Affairs Committee yesterday.Mr Leheny told the committee that one company had  loads of food bound for here which could not be lted by the hauliers because there was no accompanying paperwork. He said a breakdown in communications between government agencies and the industry in Great Britain has helped create delays.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP MP Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP MP Ian PaisleyMany companies there had wrongly believed the grace periods to help the flow of supermarket goods into NI meant no documentation at all was required. However, pre-notications to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsare still required.There is a yawning gap in the knowledge of those in Great Britain exporting to NI, said Mr Leheny.Mr Paisley said that the complications seen in the first few days of the protocol meant that it should be scrapped.A blind man on a galloping horse could have told you this would be a nightmare, he said.But Mr Leheny said there was no realistic alternative. You can#t just walk away and think something  will be better.He added: Industry here did support the backstop but the protocol is where we ended up because every alternative was rejected. The view of our industry is, let#s make it work.But despite reports of delays, a spokesman for the UK Government told the Belfastthe grace periods for supermarkets and their suppliers are working well. Lorries are travelling through NI ports and we continue to work closely with traders as they adapt to these changes.The overwhelming majority of parcels continue to move smoothly, and there is no reason for businesses not to continue to send such goods to NI.The Government is understood to see the three-month grace period from official certication for parcels as a sensible phased solution.However, operators are being urged to carry out movements in compliance with full requirements as soon as they can.The flow of goods is being monitored by HMRC. A Government source said the priority is to have a pragmatic approach that allows us to comply with the protocol without causing undue disruption to businesses and citizens. Crona Clohisey, public policy lead at Chartered Accountants Ireland, urged traders to ensure they have correct documentation, and use the Government#s Trader Support Service for help with the system for moving goods from Great Britain to NI.The reality is that while the UK and EU have concluded a free trade agreement, the NI Protocol brings a whole host of new trading rules to crucially enable frictionless trading on the island of Ireland, she said. Customs declarations are now required when goods are moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland because NI must comply with EU customs and VAT rules at its ports.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDonald Trump#s speech did not spark US Capitol riots, claims DUP#s PaisleyMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsEx-Northern Ireland star Cassidy has Alzheimer#s: We of World Cup ace opens up about battle with diseaseLatest Brexit#Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is back#Brexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderIan Paisley and Claire Hanna in name calling row over ditching NI Protocol Post-Brexit premises in Larne ready by autumnLatest from Belfast Miley Cyrus mourning ‘best friend’ following death of her dogDoubt remains over Aston Villa’s FA Cup clash with LiverpoolBBC receives  complaints over NYE fireworks display including BLM tributePlaces of worship close as latest coronavirus restrictions in Scotland continueFuneral of Dame Barbara Windsor to take place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With provision for younger age children and for children with special and additional learning needs, it is clear that there are additional risks present which are comparable to those that in health and social care.We have seen too much disruption to children#s education.Whilst teachers are doing everything that is being asked of them, they also deserve the same levels of protection.Education Minister Peter Weir has already said he would support the call for teachers to receive vaccinations as quickly as possible, but any change to the current vaccination roll-out was out of his and the Health Minister#s hands.It would be helpfulthat was made a priority, but the decision on who is vaccinated and when is made centrally between the four nations it#s not a call I or Health Minister Robin Swann can make, he said.NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland, Justin McCamphill said staff who are still working face to face with pupils need to be protected.It is in the interest of wider public health that all teachers and education staff are prioritised in the roll-out of the coronavirus vaccines, he said.

And children aged  and under are not counted in this total.Speaking to the Belfastdad of five Pol Gallagher said his family has been left bemused.It#s a total mess, making decisions changing decisions, he said. Stormont needs to get these things right. It#s undermining efforts of people trying to abide by what the lockdown restrictions actually are.On Wednesday in the Assembly First Minister Arlene Foster gave an overview of the new restrictions and when referencing the number of people who can gather in a garden Mrs Foster said that the Department of Health was working through the details and there would be clarity to come on the matter.On Wednesday night the NI Direct website was updated with the latest restrictions which remain in place until February  and will be reviewed on January .It also said that everyone must now stay at home unless they had a reasonable excuse.Earlier the head of the police federation Mark Lindsay questioned the practicality of the PSNI being able to enforce the new regulations and whether officers had the power to cross the threshold of a residence.He told the BBC#s Stephen Nolan show: We have been quite disappointed over the past year in some of the legislation that we think has been rushed, hasn#t been properly thought through, and police are left to pick up the pieces.Mr Lindsay said it would be easiertravel restrictions were in place in that officers could tell from someone#s driving licensethey were in breach of regulations.He questioned how is it practical to enforce gatherings in gardens of hundreds of thousands of homes - many of which are inaccessible. However Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs yesterday that officers did have the power of entry.The health protection regulations as laid by the department of health gave those tasked with enforcement the power to take any actions necessary to enforce any legal restrictions and it is the view of the Executive that that includes the right of power of entry, she told MLAs.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDonald Trump#s speech did not spark US Capitol riots, claims DUP#s PaisleyMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsEx-Northern Ireland star Cassidy has Alzheimer#s: We of World Cup ace opens up about battle with diseaseLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: We may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor Young#Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is back#Tributes to Antrim man who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid- seriouslyTeaching union calls for education staff to be prioritised for Covid- vaccineNorthern Ireland cancer patients told their operations won#t go ahead due to Covid- crisisLatest from Belfast Miley Cyrus mourning ‘best friend’ following death of her dogDoubt remains over Aston Villa’s FA Cup clash with LiverpoolBBC receives  complaints over NYE fireworks display including BLM tributePlaces of worship close as latest coronavirus restrictions in Scotland continueFuneral of Dame Barbara Windsor to take place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had actually sent copies of them off to Walt Disney and got a very polite rejection letter but he was very proud of the fact he got a letter with Walt Disney#s signature on the bottom.Terry adored his grandchildren Patrick, Peter, Craig and Rory, and Paul believes he must have dug out some of his old Bubble Fairy stories to tell them when they were young.Paul said Gail used her free time in lockdown to start typing her father#s notes and the family decided to use his most complete stories to use as the basis for The Bubble Fairy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail Hats off to Gail, it was no mean feat, because she#s partially sighted, added Paul. Deciphering my dad#s scribbles in pencil on old pieces of paper was not at all easy for her.She typed it up and we thought we would do a family vanity project for dad.He was obviously published a lot through print journalism but he never got to publish the book, which would have been a thrill for him.My sister just thought to gather everything he had written as best as we can, put it in a book and get it published.The book#s illustrations were drawn by Patrick, who is in his final year of animation at Ulster University. Peter completed the design and layout, Paul was responsible for production and Gail was in charge of editing the final book.Paul said his only regret is that his mother and father didn#t get the chance to see The Bubble Fairy.We#d like to think that he#s up there somewhere and we#ve done him credit, he continued.

He describes it as not having memories so much but more memories of memories after seeing videos and hearing stories about him.In a loving tribute, the family also included some photos of Terry with his grandchildren at the end of the book.Only  copies of The Bubble Fairy were printed to give to friends and family for Christmas Day but Paul saidthe feedback is positive then they will consider publishing it on a wider scale.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDonald Trump#s speech did not spark US Capitol riots, claims DUP#s PaisleyMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsEx-Northern Ireland star Cassidy has Alzheimer#s: We of World Cup ace opens up about battle with diseaseLatest Northern IrelandMother of Belfast teenager found dead in drain demands ‘thorough investigation’Coronavirus Northern Ireland: We may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor Young#Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is back#Tributes to Antrim man who died days after we shared emotional plea to take Covid- seriouslyTeaching union calls for education staff to be prioritised for Covid- vaccineLatest from Belfast Zayn Malik shares new single Vibez ahead of Nobody Is Listening album releaseDonald Trump commits to ‘seamless transition’ as he concedes to Joe BidenMiley Cyrus mourning ‘best friend’ following death of her dogDoubt remains over Aston Villa’s FA Cup clash with LiverpoolBBC receives  complaints over NYE fireworks display including BLM tribute,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Piaras Ó Mídheach Sportsfile FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDown GAA chairman John Devaney. Photo by Piaras Ó Mídheach SportsfileFrank RocheJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDown GAA chairman John Devaney has launched a staunch defence of his county#s track record of adherence to Covid- restrictions after controversy erupted over a gathering of senior football squad members on Tuesday night.But the Mourne County chief appeared to accept that the assembly of around  players - in two separate groups, to receive inidual training programmes for the coming weeks – may have been ill-advised.Okay, they probably shouldn’t have come together like that, Devaney told Independent.ie.But it was brief, it was light, they were responsible in terms of doing it, and they#re away again and won#t be back now until the beginning of February. Andhave not been together for the last seven weeks.The story of how PSNI officers arrived at Abbey CBS following a report from the public of people playing on the pitches was broken today by The Irish News, which reported that officers left having established that “no breaches of regulations had taken place as it was an elite team.”This is a reference to government-imposed regulations, not sporting ones, and there has been a predictable flood of criticism directed at Paddy Tally#s team. Earlier that same day, Croke Park had issued a fresh directive forbidding any indoor or outdoor gatherings of inter-county squads until the end of January at least.When contacted, however, Devaney was keen to stress several points, namely …It was not an actual training session.Iniduals were not being fitness-tested.It was the first collective gathering of Down players since they lost an Ulster semi-final to Cavan on November , and there won’t be any repeat while current restrictions persist.They have already initiated contact with Croke Park to discuss the matter once it became public news.The issue really seems to have arisen by the fact that the PSNI officer or officers arrived at the Abbey School, the Longford native said.When they arrived, they spoke with our management team they were happy enough that there was nothing untoward and they left.With the original January  date pencilled in for ato county training scrapped, he explained that Down#s management wanted particularly to bring some of the newer guys together to give them their programme … because we’ve had a change in our backroom team, we had a strength and conditioning coach and we had a physio, and now it’s the one person.So, he wanted just to outline for them what he needed them to do over the next couple of weeks, because it looks like we’re not going to be back until early February. And that was it.I have to say now, and I’ve been adamant about this, we have not ed to collective training. Again, I can’t speak for others. If there are others who are out there and have been regularly training, it certainly hasn’t been us, he said.When pressed about the GAA direction for no collective gatherings, and that any training instructions should have been conveyed remotely, Devaney replied: We have been doing some stuff remotely – with great dficulty.I mean, from a point of view of wanting to outline to players what is expected or needed of them over the next couple of weeks, that is why they came together. It was rather brief, and then they were away again and won’t be back now together until the GAA decide as to when counties are able to train again.Askedthere be no repeat of such gatherings, he said: Absolutely. And again, I want to re-emphasise, we have not been together since the Cavan game.There#s been quite a little bit of talk about, be it clubs or counties, coming together for training sessions. We haven#t - and there won’t be. That was the whole point, we will not be back together now until.Devaney expanded: We#ve already spoken to Croke Park about this, because obviously it has been highlighted as an issue so there’s no point in us deciding to sit there and wait on any communications. We have taken that decision ourselves.He did not anticipate punishment from the GAA, which issued a fresh reminder on Tuesday that breaches of any Covid- provisions would be dealt with under Rule .- Misconduct considered to have discredited the Association.I don’t think so, he said. Again, that’s not really up to us. I mean, we’re regularly in communication with Croke Park and with Ulster Council. I wouldn’t anticipate that.Again, from our point of view, not to say that we’re being held up as an example at this particular point because everybody has to take on their own responsibilities.I think we have a very sound record in being responsible in that regard. Again, as I stated earlier,others are out there and have been regularly training, I can’t answer for anybody . But I can certainly answer for Down.Independent.ieMost ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reportedDonald Trump#s speech did not spark US Capitol riots, claims DUP#s PaisleyMeet Belfast family of seven who can#t all gather in their own garden according to Stormont coronavirus guidelinesSnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsEx-Northern Ireland star Cassidy has Alzheimer#s: We of World Cup ace opens up about battle with diseaseLatest NewsPlaces of worship close as latest coronavirus restrictions in Scotland continueFuneral of Dame Barbara Windsor to take placeMother of Belfast teenager found dead in drain demands ‘thorough investigation’Kim Jong Un vows to improve ties with outside world at party meetingIndonesian cleric who inspired extremists freed from prisonLatest from Belfast Miley Cyrus mourning ‘best friend’ following death of her dogDoubt remains over Aston Villa’s FA Cup clash with LiverpoolBBC receives  complaints over NYE fireworks display including BLM tributePlaces of worship close as latest coronavirus restrictions in Scotland continueFuneral of Dame Barbara Windsor to take place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Facilities at Watty Graham GAC, Glen, were damaged on Saturday night after a vehicle was driven onto the main pitch. The club, who experienced a similar incident just two years ago, posted images of the damage on their social media accounts on Sunday morning, branding those responsible as morons. “Yet again our facilities have been damaged by alcohol fuelled morons. Very dficult to understand their mentality. Experience suggests that the culprits didnt travel very far,” the post stated. Some of the damage caused at Watty Grahams GAC, Glen. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Councillor for the area, Brian McGuigan, said the vandalism was an attack on the entire community. “Watty Graham Park is a community facility paid for, maintained and run by the community,” he told the County Derry Post. “I am appalled that the playing surface, maintained all year round by the dedicated volunteers at Watty Graham GAC has been extensively damaged by culprits who not only attacked the GAA facilities but have attacked the entire community. “The club volunteers of Watty Grahams have been working tirelessly alongside community groups within Maghera, helping the elderly and vulnerable during the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “This is a community working together and a community that is angry at the latest act of anti-social activity to blight the area. “It is unbelievable that a person or persons would carry out such a mindless act of vandalism on the community and the facilities. These people need to wise up and get off the communitys back.” Fellow councillor Martin Kearney also condemned the vandalism. “I deplore the recent vandalism to the Watty Grahams Pitch,” he said. “This is not the first time they have been attacked in this way. It is very disappointing when they have served the wider community so faithfully during the ongoing pandemic.     Police appeal A police spokesperson said they were aware of the incident and appealed to anyone with information to come forward. “Police in Magherafelt are appealing for information about criminal damage caused to a football pitch on Falgortrevy Road, Maghera sometime over the weekend,” they said. “It is believed that between pm on Saturdayand pm on Sunday , entry was gained to the grounds of a sports club. “A vehicle is believed to have been driven onto the pitch, performing manoeuvres that caused damage to the grass. “Enquiries are continuing, and we are appealing to anyone with information about this incident to call us on .” Information about the incident can also be passed on to investigating officers through the reporting section on the PNSIs website.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was fully booked and had to turn people away, and people have rebooked, so that means a lot,” she told the County Derry Post. “I didnt really know what I wanted to do until I left school, but I always knew I wanted to work with animals. “I wanted to be a vet, but after a bit of work experience I changed my mind!” googletag.cmd.push Clionas mum Joanne has supported her throughout her move into dog grooming, and said the former St Patricks College, Maghera student had an early introduction to animals. “There have always been animals around her,” she said. “Shes had dogs all her le and used to do horse riding lessons at Laura Browns in Magherafelt. When she was two and a half she asked Santa for a moo, neigh and a quack! “Her uncle built her a stable and Santa brought her a first Shetland pony when she was two and a half.” Dogs have always been part of Clionas le. After leaving school, Cliona completed a Diploma at Wizards of Dogs in Cookstown, where the experience was immersive. googletag.cmd.push “When I was training,a dog comes in that was biting or anything, we had to do it ourselves, to help us learn how to cope when we qualy,” she told the County Derry Post. “That prepared me for going out on my own when you get dogs like that you know how to deal with it. You just try your best to work with them and find a way that works better than what youve tried. “I couldnt have done it without the Wizard of Dogs, Ive learned so much. You do your first aid and start off grooming two dogs a day.     “By the end it was loads more, and I covered all the dferent cuts, so I got plenty of experience there,” she added. While dog groomers have been able to remain open throughout the latest raft of Covid- restrictions, Clionas sister, Nicole, hasnt been so lucky. “Her sister has a salon in Maghera and we were laughing that Cliona has only started and she can stay open whereas Nicole has to close,” explained Joanne. “We could maybe get her an odd dog to bath.” You can follow Fairy Tail Dog Grooming by visiting their Facebook and Instagram pages.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council is now looking to set up the new  to ask their opinion on the design quality of any planning applications which are made for these sites. One of the sites expected to be discussed is the derelict site of the former Tillie and Henderson shirt factory at the cityside end of the Craigavon Bridge. googletag.cmd.push It emerged recently that the current owner of the site is to apply for planning permission to build an apartment complex on the land. Speaking at a meeting yesterday of the local councils Planning Committee, Eamon Molloy, the councils Head of Planning Performance and Improvement, outlined the proposal for the new advisory . He said the creation of such  had been put forward as part of a review of the Planning Service. Mr Molloy said the  would offer advice to councillors on important gateway sites in the council area.

He said he would bring a report on the matter to next months meeting of the Planning Committee. There has been much debate in recent years about the development of gateway sites in Derry. The Tillie and Henderson site, in particular, has been at the forefront of the discussions. The site has been unused since the derelict factory building was destroyed in a fire in . The owners of the site, Belfast-based Andras House, had originally planned to build a hotel on the site.     However, those plans never came to fruition and it emerged last month that Andras House has now teamed up with local developers, the Martin Property Group, to build an apartment complex on the site. Director of Andras House, Rajesh Rana, said a residential development is the most appropriate use that can be delivered at this time. Just across the road from the Tillie and Henderson site is another derelict piece of land which was also previously home to a shirt factory. This would also be regarded as a gateway site in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds.

Scottish Cup on Sunday.The -year old saved two spot-kicks against Championship side Hearts as the nine-in-a-row Scottish champions clinched an historic quadruple treble. The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

Self on Western ShoreThe proposed retrospective exhibition of O’Neill marking the th anniversary of his birth, was due to open on November  in Dublin’s Farmleigh Gallery, having been postponed from its original date in May due to the pandemic. “It was to be the first time since his  Belfast retrospective,” David Britton’s letter continued, “that so many of Daniel O’Neill’s works were to be seen together and included a number of works from The Ulster Museum Collection, as well as from many private collections.”Undeterred by the exhibition’s demise, Karen was determined to mark O’Neill’s centenary year “so we pushed ahead independently” explained David, “and published this monograph on him.” It’s a lavishly illustrated book with over  reproductions of O’Neill’s work and black and white period-photographs of himself and his friends. \"Girl from The North by Daniel ONeill“This is very much an Ulster story,” David’s note continued “as unlike his artist friends Gerard Dillon and George Campbell, who left Northern Ireland, O’Neill lived in Belfast and County Down for  of his  years.”The book is the result of a decade of research and contains much new information on the artist, his le, and the art scene in Dublin and Belfast in the period from  to the early s. The O’Neill family “lived in a Victorian redbrick terrace at  Dimsdale Street, overshadowed by Mackie’s iron factory,” the book’s introduction begins.Daniel was born on January ,  and started painting at the early age of  years old. He loved reading art books from his local library.\"Front Cover of the Book“Following his education at St John’s school on Colinward street , O’Neill left school to become an apprentice electrician.”He and his art-loving friends were “drawn to the Belfast Reference Library to learn more about art.”The author quotes a reference to the head librarian, Mr Jenkinson, “who would, contrary to library rules, allow O’Neill and his fellow painters to borrow illustrated texts for the weekends.”The book recounts O’Neill’s first attempts to exhibit in Belfast during World War II with fellow artists and le-long friends, Gerard Dillon and George Campbell. Considered a mysterious and enigmatic figure during his letime, and “tall, graceful, and incredibly good looking”, new research material in the book shines light on O’Neill’s personal strugglesand his complex relationship with his dealer, Victor Waddington. As well as his solo exhibitions, Karen Reihill’s book explores O’Neill’s participation in mixed exhibitions of Irish art sponsored by Waddington and the new Irish Arts Council, which took place in Ireland, UK, Europe, North America and Canada. In addition to Dillon and Campbell, other artists included in O’Neill’s story are Colin Middleton, Arthur Campbell, Markey Robinson, Nano Reid, Nevill Johnson, Arthur Armstrong and James MacIntyre. Paintings exhibited in art institutions at home and abroad are reproduced in the book for the first time, complimented by archival photographs of O’Neill and his friends, showing the reader how O’Neill adapted to the ious political, social and economic changes in Ireland until his untimely death in . It’s a vivid and evocative portrayal of the somewhat forgotten artist’s le, work and fellow-artists by an accomplished author and art consultant who ran Bonham’s world-renowned, picture department in London in the late s.Karen is a vocal st century champion for the Ulster Painters who has also worked as a conservator at Ireland’s National Gallery before founding Dublin’s Frederick Gallery with husband and fellow art-lover David Britton in . The book ends with acclaimed author and Irish art critic Brian Fallon’s commendation of O’Neill as “one of the strongest and most original personalities in Irish art since the second world war…. a visual poet whose imagination has its own soft, haunting and very inidual radiance.”Daniel O’Neill Romanticism  Friendships, by Karen Reihill, is available to order from bookshops, or online at www.frederickgallerybookshop.

They wrote “We have nonetheless heard the criticism that we should have done more to include a broader range of victims’ voices...we and our other stakeholders plan to engage in wider discussions with the victims’ sector and others.”However I fear such discussions will not involve ‘others’ with a dferent view on legacy, who fear history is being rewritten to give terrorists and the state equivalence.The imprimatur of the Archbishop of Canterbury was used to draw in top officials including Madeleine Alessandri, the NIO permanent secretary, MoD generals, Jon Boutcher of Kenova and ious ex-paramilitaries. But only one legal option ‘on prosecutions and imprisonment’, the ‘Model Bill’ of QUB Professor Kieran McEvoy and the Committee for the Administration on Justice , was discussed.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Jeff Dudgeon is a writer and commentator and former Ulster Unionist Party councillorNo unionist parties or non-nationalist victims’ groups were invited, so no other view was heard. The QUB CAJ ‘Model Bill’ had a recently added proposal of “reducing conflict-related imprisonment from two years to zero” which took account of the new strength of the veterans’ lobby. It means trials are held but convicted soldiers and paramilitaries are not jailed — a further iant of an amnesty, with prosecutions rendered entirely meaningless. The change would still permit trench lawfare against the security forces in the form of judicial reviews, public inquiries, reopened inquests, civil suits, damages claims, Strasbourg cases and private prosecutions. They are unstoppable in legacy legislation.The cheerleaders for the Stormont House Agreement are however determined to undermine the secretary of state’s outline plan of March  for narrowing legacy institutions, and cannot allow other options into the mix. UUP leader Steve Aiken recently called on Queen’s University to create a professorship “to study unionism and its contribution to Northern Ireland”. This idea was not well received, with many defending academic freedom for staff to express their ideas. I would concur on that freedom. It is the silent suppression of other ideas that is most concerning. Where are the genuine academic liberals of yesteryear  Some research on the websites of the law departments of Queen’s and Ulster University is revealing. At QUB, seven out of  law professors have transitional justice and human rights in their titles. Kieran McEvoy for example is Professor of Law and Transitional Justice while Colin Harvey is Professor of Human Rights Law. Both universities now have Transitional Justice Institutes. No research seems commissioned from another outlook.This smacks of colonisation. Where once quiet unionists were accused of being dominant in the Queen’s law faculty, with just a smattering of liberals, matters are entirely reversed. Indeed I am aware of only one academic who has made a critical analysis of transitional justice and none who look at a human rights perspective from anything other than the dogma of ‘Article -compliance’. Nothing for example has been published that considers the often competing demands in legacy of other European Convention on Human Rightsarticles, such as Nos.  and .Another view, increasingly, cannot be conceived of.Last month, the former Attorney General John Larkin for NI tried to bring balance to the debate. He called for the existing Supreme Court ruling that the ECHR’s Article  could not apply before the Human Rights Act of  to be put into legislation. This went undiscussed as nobody risked engaging but it would help to challenge at Strasbourg. The Malone House Group, which I convene, has tried to counter the increasing consensus around the CAJ approach to legacy.It is at present the only NGO that has put alternate legal views on those competing ECHR rights before the Council of Europe which enforces the court’s decisions. They are on the Strasbourg website. I await an invitation to discuss them from the universities, the Archbishop and indeed the broadcasting media.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The hope is that unionists will consent to anything even the Irish sea border in order to keep governing the Province and remain in the UK. They have absolutely no intention of ever ing to direct rule over Northern Ireland ever again — as proved conclusively during the three year collapse of the assembly. We have got to grin and bear this situation, because there is absolutely nothing that we can do as unionists to change the facts on the ground. Unionist leaders have been consistently out-manoeuvred by British governments and all the protests in the world have failed to change anything from the prorogation of Stormont in , the Anglo Irish Agreement and many other developments forwards.We should become as devious and subtle as republicans, because that is the only way to deal with successive British leaders who have absolutely no interest in or sympathy for our cause, and will always put the interests particularly of England first — note the NI protocol was the price of Brexit which was cheerfully paid, because there are no votes for any British party in Northern Ireland and they really have no ‘selfish or strategic’interest in this place .Frank McClintock, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Craigavon Civic CentreAt the time, DUP Alderman Stephen Moutray told officers they should be “embarrassed” by the contents of the report and a proposal from Councillor Mark Baxter, seconded by Alderman Ian Burns, saw officers redraw their plans.Revised plans were brought before the committee in December with two options, both with an allocated budget of £, put to members.DUP group leader Mark Baxter proposed that option one was supported by Council and this proposal was seconded by UUP Alderman Ian Burns.All DUP and UUP members of the committee voted in favour of the proposal with all SDLP and Sinn Fein councillors voting against .The committeeChair, Alliance Party councillor Brian Pope abstained from the vote. As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

And we donrsquot want to give coronavirus to our close family or friends.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people must show \"extreme caution\" during the Christmas period and consider whether it is wise to mix with families, and particularly elderly and vulnerable family members.He said that it had been \"unanimously agreed\" among the four UK nations that the approved relaxation of restrictions should remain, as \"we dont want to criminalise peoples long-made plans\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

You donrsquot come into palliative care to keep patients at armrsquos .She said the use of PPE had been dficult ndash especially during the heatwaves.She then had a further risk assessment which classed her as vulnerable, meaning she couldnrsquot be face to face with patients and her role changed again.She was drafted back to the clinical specialist team, but instead of seeing patients herself in their homes, she would see them virtually or speak to them over the phone.ldquoHaving been right up there with the patients, the role changed, and I couldnt see a face to face patient at all for about two and a half months, and we had to adapt to a whole new way of working.ldquoThe patients have adapted really well to it, and in some cases, I think some patients have found it better.ldquoOur patients are wonderful and even though they are palliative patients theyve got to make you a cup of tea, get the cakes ready, make sure the house is tidy and theyre not doing that now before the nurses come, because they can sit in a corner of the room and thats the only little corner I see.She will be working through the Christmas period, and last year worked on Christmas Day.ldquoPalliative care never stops, and Christmas is no dferent.ldquoWe are a service that needs to be here for our patients and we accept that, we come into nursing knowing youre going to be working some of these important days.She says her own family are flexible ndash as she encourages the families she cares for to be flexible ndash around moving Christmas celebrations.ldquoI think this year is going to be dficult more than other years, becauseyou know this is going to be your last Christmas and its restricted, perhaps cant go out for that big Christmas last lunch you wanted to have or you cant have as many relatives around your house as you would have liked to have had.Talking about her work on the charityrsquos information and support line, she added that there had been numerous calls, both related to Covid and about terminal illness in general, which she provides information to people about from a clinical perspective.The support line, which also includes trained officers and bereavement volunteers as well as Marie Curie Nurses, is open to patients, families and professionals who need to talk to someone about any aspect of dying, death and bereavement.Sharing her final thoughts at the end of , she said: ldquoWe had a lot of personal challenges in  in our family, we had a bereavement ourselves and I couldnt wait to see the back of  and said I cant wait for .ldquoI will never ever wish a year away again.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Not just from the virus but the isolation our response to it creates.So the Penarth Times will publish, online and in print, a list of support services - public organisations, charities, community groups and local volunteers - who are there to help in whatever way through this dficult time.And we are asking you to play your part by doing three things.First,you know an organisation or group that should be on our list, let us know and well add them so more people can benefit.If you know of a group doing good in your community, tell us so we can share their story and provide hope and inspiration.And, most importantly, think about who the people are in your community who you might be able to help, be it a card through the door or dropping off some shopping.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
