Far more people understand and accept the reality of anthropogenic climate change, and yet we seem paralysed by despair, caught in a spell of inertia, even as the most lurid of predictions – floods, fires, plagues – come to pass. I say we, but the generation born into the reality of global heating are refusing to accept this lethal status quo. The testimonies of these teens and early twenty-somethings are humbling and often thrilling. By setting up a student bank based on recycling waste, José Adolfo Quisocala single-handedly changed child poverty and environmental pollution in his town in Peru. Though their projects vary widely, these young activists have a strikingly shared sense of what must be changed, from education and the foregrounding of indigenous voices to making people appreciate the value of nature. As Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, an activist from Uganda, says: “We are a generation of scared people. But we are very persistent. And very united.” This is the kind of vision and ambition necessary from the delegates at COP26. The stakes could not be higher. If only our leaders had the courage of these kids. Olivia Laing It was in November 2013 that the urgency of the climate crisis became clear to Marinel Ubaldo. A typhoon had been forecast in the Philippines and it was due to hit the peaceful village in Eastern Visayas where she lived with her family. Initially, she wasn’t especially worried. “We had been living with typhoons all our lives – it was not new to us,” she remembers. Her father, a fisherman, told her to go to a nearby shelter that was on higher ground. It was the right decision: Haiyan hit the Philippines with winds up to 195mph, one of the world’s strongest ever typhoons. Buildings that Ubaldo had thought were strong were ripped apart in seconds. More than 7,360 people were killed or went missing and at least 4 million were displaced. The disaster dramatically altered the way Ubaldo saw the planet. “It gave me a new perspective on what the future could be,” she says. Two years later, Ubaldo won a scholarship to study social work in Tacloban, a city devastated by the typhoon, working alongside studying so that she could help her family, who had lost everything as a result of the typhoon. Increasingly, she devoted her time to fighting the climate crisis.  Ubaldo has since protested at Shell’s Manila headquarters, in front of the Wall Street Bull in New York, and helped organise the first climate youth strike in Eastern Visayas. Her proudest moment, she says, was testifying as a community witness to the Philippines Commission on Human Rights as part of their investigation into corporate responsibility for climate change. In 2019, the commission found that 47 major oil, coal, cement and mining companies could be held liable for the impact of their operations on Filipino citizens. The landmark ruling illustrated “the power of people”, says Ubaldo. “Even if you are poor, or just only one, or from a remote community, you have power. You can always call out corporations and leaders who are fuelling climate change.” Ubaldo, who now works full time on climate issues, focuses on supporting grassroots initiatives. She co-founded the group Youth Leaders for Environmental Action Federation, is a climate justice youth adviser for Greenpeace Philippines and also works with Living Laudato Si’ Philippines, an interfaith movement that advocates for the estment of coal. Her work is high risk. According to Global Witness, 29 activists were killed last year in the Philippines. It is common for activists to receive threats or be subject to “red tagging” – labelled by the state as communists or terrorists. Last year, four activists and a journalist from Tacloban were arrested for possession of firearms following an illegal raid. It has been claimed that security forces had falsified evidence and Amnesty International has called for an investigation. At the time of the raid, Ubaldo received a message suggesting she too would be arrested and moved to stay with a friend as a precaution. “The thing is,” she says, “they don’t just come for you, they come for your family, for your friends… That worries me more than my own safety.” But the threats, she says, are at least a sign that those in power are hearing your voice.“This is very personal for me. If I do not continue fighting I will feel that I am betraying the people who perished because of climatic disasters. Because they are not just numbers, they are not just climate statistics.” Who is your climate villain? “The corporations, all of them. They are profiting from our suffering.” If you had the power to make one change to combat the climate crisis, large or small, what would it be? “I would go to the community and ask them what they want and support their own grassroots climate actions. And I would let the fossil fuels stay in the ground.” Rebecca Ratcliffe Not many 17-year-olds have ground-breaking judicial decisions named after them, but as lead litigant in Sharma and others v Minister for the Environment, Anjali Sharma achieved that world first when Judge Bromberg ruled in May this year that the minister did have a duty of care not to harm children. Sharma became involved in School Strike 4 Climate in 2019 after hearing about the impact climate change had on relatives who are farmers in India. “This stuff drives people to anxiety, it drives people to tears because it’s just so real for us right now,” she says. Plenty is happening for Sharma. First, the Australian government is appealing against the duty of care ruling later this month, then she has exams. She’s also focused on her twin passions of music and netball. “At school everyone knows me as ‘that kid’. It’s completely different when I go to netball where I can be a normal teenage girl – because that’s what I am.” If you could make one change… “I’d cut all Australian government ties with mining companies such as Origin and Santos, which have constantly procured grants for new fossil fuel exploration projects and influenced Australia’s climate policy due to their Australian political connections. Instead I’d have our climate policy influenced by our First Nations people and those on the frontlines. These are the people who have a true connection and love for the land.” Meg Keneally For years, twice a day Aadya Joshi walked past a scrapyard in her neighbourhood of south Mumbai on her way to and from school. Originally meant to be the garden of the local police station, it had become an overgrown, toxic eyesore with a decade’s waste festering in the heat. When she was 15, in her summer holidays, Joshi decided to do something about it. “I walked in to the police station and was like, ‘Can I please clean your garden?’” recalls Joshi. “It took three or four weeks of me just being like, ‘Please, please, please, please, please,’ and coming back every day, rain or shine. I had to convince them that I was not going to flake halfway and leave them with more work.” The plot of land is long and thin: about the dimensions of a cricket wicket. But, over the course of four Sundays in the summer, with help from local residents, Joshi did more than clear it. She replanted it with native Indian plants and trees. It was gruelling but rewarding work: “When I say toxic I really mean it,” says Joshi. “The first day that we cleaned up I made the mistake of not wearing gloves and I was sick for two weeks.” The idea for native planting came from Joshi’s reading on the Miyawaki method of afforestation and the work of University of Delaware ecologist Douglas Tallamy. These both argue that planting the right trees can have a significant impact on restoring insect and animal bioersity. The results in Mumbai were pretty well instantaneous: monkeys now hang out at the police station, and butterflies and birds have made the garden their home. “It’s definitely difficult being a kid telling adults what to do,” says Joshi. “Not everyone is always receptive, but I think there’s a benefit with having actual science to back up what you’re saying.” After creating the garden, Joshi developed a database of 2,000 plants indigenous to the Indian subcontinent and last year was awarded the annual Children’s Climate prize, founded by Swedish energy company Telge Energi. She also began planning larger projects, but these were curtailed first by Covid, and now because she has just started as an undergraduate on the Earth Systems Program at Stanford University. Her advice for others looking to follow in her footsteps is to start small. “If you bite off more than you can chew in the beginning, you stagnate and you lose motivation,” she says. “But something small, like your neighbourhood police station, it’s very manageable.” Who is your climate hero? “Dr Douglas Tallamy. His book Bringing Nature Home is all about how native plants preserve bioersity. The whole point was to take that research and put it into a local context for India.” How do you relax? “A good book. Recently Indica: A Deep Natural History of the Indian Subcontinent by Pranay Lal and In the Kingdom of Ice by Hampton Sides. It’s very depressing, but it’s very good.” If you could make one change… “It would be to plant native everywhere.” Tim Lewis “Your beds may be comfortable for now but not for long,” Hilda Flavia Nakabuye told the 2019 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen. “You will soon feel the same heat we feel every day.” As a child, Nakabuye watched heavy rains, strong winds and drought gradually devastate her grandparents’ farm. Cassava, matoke and potato gardens withered livestock died and eventually her family was forced to sell off the land.  “We are a generation of scared people,” she says, “but we are very persistent. And very united.” If you could make one change… “Haha, that sounds like a lot of power! Within one hour I would shut down all fossil fuel industries.” Sarah Donaldson Yusuf Baluch became an activist last year in the wake of a massive forest fire near his home town of Gwadar, southwest Pakistan, though he says the climate crisis has shadowed his life since childhood. Now he spends much of his time organising for Fridays for Future and engaging in school strikes, despite the threat of arrest from Pakistan’s military. “Giving up is not an option,” he says. “I have to fight on.” If you could make one change… “There should be climate clubs and centres everywhere, at a local level, so people can get educated – so we can fight this together.” Killian Fox Vic Barrett does not speak Polish. The tattoo artist he met did not have much English. But, during some downtime at the 2018 United Nations climate change conference in Katowice, Barrett presented his arm to him along with a rough sketch of a geometric design featuring the number “370”, the “greater than” sign and two diamonds. “We still had a pretty good time,” says the 22-year-old Barrett now, laughing. “And it was a special trip and it just felt right to somehow commemorate it.” The 370 in the tattoo refers to a measurement in parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: this was the level it was at when Barrett was born in 1999. It’s now more than 400ppm, which most scientists agree is a hazardous indicator of human-made climate change. Barrett turns serious: “The tattoo is a reminder to myself and to others that there are generations of young people who have been born into a world that we know scientifically is incapable of sustaining them,” he says. “It’s highlighting this unique experience of being a young person on the planet right now.” Barrett’s awakening to the climate emergency came in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy tore up the east coast of North America. He was living in New York and while the damage was widespread – around 650,000 homes were destroyed 8.5 million people were stranded without power – he noticed that the devastation was especially severe for low and middle-income people, whose homes were more likely to be built in flood-prone areas and who were less likely to have insurance. Aged 14, Barrett, who has black and indigenous Honduran heritage, began working with the nonprofit Global Kids and ed deep into “environmental racism”. In 2015, Barrett was one of a group of 21 young people who sued the US government for violating their fifth and ninth amendment rights by encouraging the use of fossil fuels since the 1960s. Juliana v United States has now been in the courts for a quarter of Barrett’s life and the case continues to rumble on. Much of the past six years has clearly been thrilling: speaking at the UN, hanging out with Greta Thunberg, becoming a powerful voice of youth activism. But Barrett hopes that the next generation will not have to follow his path. “I don’t really want my kids to have to sue the US federal government or to have to be environmental activists in school, to speak at the UN,” he says. “I’m sure that would be awesome for them, but I don’t want them to have to fight the way we did.” Who is your climate hero? “Berta Cáceres. She’s a Honduran water protector, who ended up being killed for fighting against a dam that was going to harm the indigenous people of her community.” And your climate villain? “Hypocritical politicians. In the US now we have an administration that claims to have more progressive values, but, for example, there are still pipelines being built through indigenous-treaty territories.” If you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? “I want to see a better version of the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) process. Right now it’s all hired negotiators from different countries and their whole job is to negotiate. I would like to see more indigenous leaders included, more black leaders included, more leaders from the global south included.” How do you relax? “I like to go kayaking, hang out with my friends, go out to the bar sometimes, play video games. Regular kiddo stuff.” TL When he was seven, José Adolfo Quisocala created a bank for school friends in his home town of Arequipa, Peru, to save money to buy books, stationery and uniforms. Now, nine years later, the Bartselana Student Bank has 6,700 clients, all aged under 18. As well as saving, children can earn money by bringing plastic and paper to recycle at school drop-offs – the money is automatically credited to their bank accounts. Every month, the bank recycles between 15 and 16 tonnes of paper and plastic through local companies. The idea came to Quisocala when he saw children begging at traffic lights and wondered how he could help them and their families earn and save, as well as recycle household rubbish that would otherwise become litter or go into landfill. He missed out on school to pursue his idea, but it was worth it, he says. “In my town, I was able to considerably reduce the level of child poverty, the school drop-out rate and environmental pollution.” Quisocala also helped create the Bartselana Foundation, which converts donations of recyclable waste from local companies into funds to combat child hunger and improve education. Since the onset of the pandemic, the foundation has been making free online educational videos – explaining, for example, how to distinguish different types of plastics and paper for recycling – which it puts out via social media. “This is such important and relevant information that is not taught in school, that we had to make it public and free to watch,” says Quisocala. Now 16, he plans to hand over the running of the bank to a new (also young) CEO in order to go to university. He intends to continue his social activism, working with the “least-favoured or forgotten groups in Latin America” and helping them profit by carrying out environmental services. If you could make one change… “I would teach children, the young, adults and senior citizens what awaits us in the future if we continue living the way we are now. The climate plays a role in every aspect of our lives our money, our health, agriculture, our flora and fauna. With education, people can take small steps to improve the relationship between humans and nature.” Dan Collyns It was a school lesson on Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King that made sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen think about how they could change the world and in 2013, aged 10 and 12, they launched Bye Bye Plastic Bags, an initiative to stop single-use bags which is now active in 30 countries. “It organically started to grow,” explains Melati, now 20. “Young people could see a real-life example of what was possible.” The girls’ campaign was exemplary. They started making educational booklets to explain the dangers of marine pollution and set up a pilot scheme for a plastic-free village. Next came a how-to video on making a river barrier from recycled material to prevent rubbish reaching the sea and a social enterprise scheme employing local women to make reusable bags. In 2018 they resorted to hunger strike when the governor of Bali wouldn’t meet and discuss government policy. He caved in two days later and by 2019, single-use plastic bags were banned from the island. Now the Wijsens have launched an online learning platform called Youthopia. “It has masterclasses, workshops and mentorship. We want it to become the world’s HQ for young change-makers.” It’s hard to imagine they won’t make it happen. If you could make one change… “I would adapt the education system to teach about these problems and create spaces for innovation. Young people are not given the tools or the guidance to think big and create new systems.” Alice Fisher Scarlett Westbrook is a 17-year-old with an open expression, friendly smile and plaits like bell-pulls. It would be natural to assume – had you never heard her speak – that she was an ordinary schoolgirl and not the formidable climate justice activist she is. But by the age of 10, Scarlett was already going on marches and canvassing for local elections (at the time, she was “really into” Ed Miliband’s climate policies). She has grown up in inner-city Birmingham and her encouraging parents – not in any political party themselves – would tag along with her as she knocked on doors. It must have been clear then that Scarlett was not born to be one of life’s passengers. At 13, she distinguished herself by passing an A-level in government and politics – the youngest person ever to do so. She taught herself in seven months. Her speciality was climate and education which was what, in part, led to her later work as a member of the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN). Neither her parents nor her teachers believed Scarlett when she told them she intended to sit the A-level, so Westbrook emailed the exam board… “I kept arguing until I got my way!” (A useful talent in an activist.) Westbrook has been one of the leading organisers of the school strikes in Birmingham and is the youngest known “regular policy writer” in parliamentary history. She won the Women of the Future Young Star award in 2020 and the Diana award this year, for humanitarian work. Scarlett is invariably modest about her achievements – not wishing to distract from what matters most to her. She now heads up Teach the Future, the impressive student-led campaign founded by her friend Joe Brindle, which aims to transform the British education system by putting the climate at its centre. It is responsible for “the first ever student bill, the English Climate Emergency Education Act” and for holding a parliamentary reception, organised and led by Westbrook, for more than 100 MPs and Lords. (It has secured cross-party support from everyone except the DUP.) She argues that climate should be “woven like a golden thread into every single subject”. And her own thinking proves impressively joined up: she talks eloquently about climate crisis in relation to capitalism, colonialism, gender inequality and pandemics. How do you relax? “It often feels like the weight of the future is on our shoulders so it is really important to wind down and spend time with people you care about to maintain your capacity to act, and your wellbeing.” Solar or nuclear? “Solar!” If you could make one change… “I would implement an international Green New Deal, which would aim not only to decarbonise the economy through a 10-year, government-led mobilisation but also to create jobs and to bridge the inequality ide through investment in the areas that need it most.” Kate Kellaway “My two loves are exploring and inventing,” says 20-year-old Fionn Ferreira, who won the top global award at the 2019 Google Science Fair for his work on reducing plastic pollution in water. It was while kayaking around the coast of West Cork, where he grew up, that Ferreira became keenly aware of the problem – not just large plastics bobbing on the waves but microplastics pervading the water around him. Aged 15, he designed his own spectrometer to measure the amount of microplastics in local water – the readings were so high that at first he thought the machine was broken. Then he set about finding a way to remove them. “I thought, what’s plastic made of? It’s made of crude oil. And why does crude oil float on top of water? Because the polarity is different.” By adding magnetite to oil, he discovered that he could attract the microplastics in a sample of water and remove the vast majority of them with a magnet. Winning awards and backing at such a young age has given Ferreira a sense that youth should not be a barrier to effecting real change. “I feel like we need more people involved in innovation and invention at a small level, because every idea has the power to make a difference,” he says. If you could make one change… “We need to get everybody to fall in love with the environment and be really, really angry about what’s happening to it. Because only with everybody on board, doing their bit, can we create change.” KF Mya-Rose Craig was nine days old when she first went birdwatching near her home in Bristol. “My parents and my older sister were massive birdwatchers. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t love birds,” she says. She has been blogging about birds as Birdgirl since she was 11 and posting on Twitter as @BirdgirlUK since the age of 12. “That was when I started becoming passionate about environmental issues, especially climate change,” she says. It was also around this time she started noticing something about outdoor spaces. “My mum is Bangladeshi and my sister and I are half Bangladeshi and I became aware that I never saw anyone who looked like us out in the countryside. As I looked into it, I realised this wasn’t a superficial thing, it was systemic exclusion linked to the racial make-up of conservation bodies and the costs of getting into nature, among other things. Conversations with my cousins made me aware that birding and being in the outdoors are seen by non-white people as really white hobbies.” Craig set up Black2Nature, a non-profit organisation that campaigns for equal access to nature for all, runs nature camps and activities for people traditionally excluded from the countryside and campaigns to make the nature conservation and environmental sectors ethnically erse. Her activism has won her a platform on television (Springwatch, Countryfile) and radio (Start the Week) and a doctorate in science from the University of Bristol. Now 19 and studying at Cambridge University, Craig has just published We Have a Dream (Magic Cat), a book of interviews with 30 young environmental activists of colour – “people who weren’t getting the platform from the media that they deserve”.  If you could make one change…. “I’d get genuine action from our leaders, right now.” Lisa O’Kelly Dubbed “France’s Greta Thunberg” by the French media, Iris Duquesne was 16 when she joined 15 other teenage climate activists, including Thunberg, in late 2019 to bring a landmark legal complaint to the United Nations against France, Brazil, Germany, Turkey and Argentina. Their charge – that these countries were violating their rights as children by not taking sufficient measures against climate change – resonated around the globe. Last week the UN declared it was unable to rule on the case, saying the young people must first bring lawsuits in each of the five state’s national courts, despite tomes of case law showing that no such procedures would succeed. Speaking through her legal team at the non-profit Earthjustice, Duquesne said: “We are all very disappointed but unfortunately not surprised. We have seen governments and officials ignore the climate crisis over and over again and today was no exception. The fight for climate justice is not over, and we will keep pushing with or without the Committee’s help.” If you could make one change…. “I’d use education worldwide to instil a real sense of climate responsibility in the next generation.” LO’K Jakob Blasel’s blond curls have been a regular sight at Fridays for Future protests in Germany since the then 18-year-old organised the country’s first climate strike, outside the regional parliament in Kiel in December 2018. He proved a canny organiser and passionate motivator, rallying students through WhatsApp chat groups or by spraying messages on the pavement outside their schools. “From day one it was very important to me that Fridays for Future wasn’t just made up of kids who already cared about environmental issues,” he says. “It was about starting a movement that spoke to an entire generation.” Three years later, Blasel is knocking on the doors of the Bundestag in Berlin: as a Green party candidate in his home constituency in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany’s northernmost state, he gained 23,831 votes at September’s federal elections, only narrowly missing out on a parliamentary seat via the party’s list. The eldest of three brothers, Blasel says he was vaguely aware of climate change as a child. “But it wasn’t until I was 15-16 that the climate crisis became something that caused me distress.” In 2017 he watched a Norwegian documentary about the global textile industry. “How could it be, I asked myself, that my teenage peers and I were wearing clothes that were produced under inhumane conditions in the global south? From that, I moved on to thinking about how clothes could be produced in a way that was not just socially fairer, but also more environmentally sustainable.” The teenager started wearing more secondhand clothes, and he convinced his parents to switch to get their electricity from renewable providers. “But there was a point where that approach reached a limit: even if I change my behaviour as a consumer, we’re still headed for an ecological and societal crisis. If I really cared about making a difference, I realised, I needed to take a political approach.” In his campaign and on social media, Blasel describes himself as an “1.5C ultra”, claiming a term usually employed by fanatical football supporters. “Maybe that’s a little bit of a joke,” he says, “but in terms of real politics, it means I am convinced that every possible effort needs to be made to limit global warming to 1.5C. “Now I see a lot of politicians realising that we need to have more ambitious climate targets. But they are still telling fairytales about how we will get there: that technology will magically solve climate change, that we just need to leave it up to the markets. We already have these technologies, we just need to use them. And at the moment that’s not happening to the right extent.” Blasel says his run for the Bundestag has made him understand better why the political debate on the climate crisis has got stuck, and how it could be made to start moving again. “Being an activist means constantly pushing your own interest to the foreground, while the art of being a politician lies in reconciling different interests.” The German Green party could hold a key role in the next government, as one of three coalition partners in a liberal-left power-sharing deal. Blasel says he’s planning to slip back into his old activist roles to remind his party of its promises while coalition talks are ongoing. “I will keep on giving my best to fight the climate crisis. Whether I do that from parliament or as an activist is almost irrelevant.” Who is your climate hero? “Stefan Rahmstorf, the German climatologist who was one of the earliest scientists to lay bare the dramatic extent of the climate crisis.” Solar or nuclear? “Solar. People don’t feel safe around nuclear power plants. I don’t think most people who are still evangelising about nuclear power have thought their position through.” If you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? “The switch to renewable energy has to be the basis for every step we take to address the crisis.” Philip Oltermann Disha Ravi experienced climate change growing up in rural India long before she knew what it was. “My grandparents are farmers and faced water shortages my mother had to carry water from the common well before she left for school and none of us realised that this was the result of the climate crisis. Only when I was 18 did I understand it – and the inaction from our leaders.” Ravi co-founded the Indian branch of Fridays for Future (FFF) in 2019 and spent two years organising workshops, local clean-ups and tree planting. She is also the family breadwinner, with her job at a vegan food company in Bengaluru, where she lives with her mother. One campaign close to her heart was the 2020–2021 Indian farmers protest when a set of farm bills that seemed to favour corporations over farmers sparked huge outcry in India, especially over minimum prices for produce. When Greta Thunberg tweeted about the campaign in February, it was Ravi who made international headlines. She was arrested for sedition and criminal conspiracy and taken to Delhi where she was held for 10 days. Police said a social media toolkit Ravi had edited for the campaign had caused disaffection and disinformation. Ravi is unable to discuss her ongoing legal case but her campaigning spirit is undiminished. “I have seen my own house fill with water in a landlocked city, trees cut to grow the GDP, and poison released in rivers as businesses push off responsibility. I refuse to let this continue for others.” If you could make one change… “People in India face the climate crisis on a daily basis, but access to the latest science around the environment is still limited to elite private schools. Education will bring about awareness and the climate action we need.” AF Lesein Mutunkei was 12 when he decided that for every football goal he scored, he’d plant a tree. He realised the idea could go big – after all, “the climate crisis is a universal problem and football is a universal game”. He got his school in Nairobi signed up and started Trees for Goals as a movement. In 2019, aged 14, he went to the Kenyan Ministry of Environment and the scheme became national. This year he’s a Children’s Climate prize finalist. If you could make one change… “I would ensure Fifa, all leagues, clubs and schools and 3.5 billion fans across the world took up Trees for Goals and use the power of football to tackle deforestation, which is the second biggest contributor to climate change.” AF Amy and Ella Meek founded Kids Against Plastic in 2016 after finding out for the first time about the effects of plastic pollution. The sisters were being home schooled and their parents, both teachers, decided they should learn about the UN’s global goals for sustainable development. The goal that piqued their interest was number 14: Life below water. “We started seeing all these images of sea creatures tangled up in plastic,” says Amy, now 18. “It was just heartbreaking to see and really shocking.” “Plastic pollution wasn’t so much in the news then, so we were completely unaware of how the plastic we were using and throwing away was having such a negative impact,” says Ella, 16. “We realised that a lot of other ordinary people were probably unaware of it too, so we decided to take action.” Their campaign against plastic waste had small beginnings. “We were quite young, only 10 and 12, so we started off by litter picking. As soon as we started picking up plastic we saw how quickly it was being replaced and that was really motivating,” says Ella. In the five years since the sisters have picked up a massive 96,685 pieces of single-use plastic. Their target is 100,000, because that is the number of sea mammals that die each year as a result of being trapped in plastic or eating it. They have also given hundreds of talks at schools and festivals, including a TEDx talk, and launched nationwide “Plastic Clever” schemes to help UK schools, restaurants, businesses, festivals and councils to reduce the amount of single-use plastic they use. How do you both relax? “We’re just normal teenagers so if we’re not campaigning we’ll spend time together, watch TV, read books, talk to our friends.” Lab beef or grass-fed? “We’re vegan!” If you could make one change… “We’d make sure people with the power to take action take on board advice from young people.” LO’K In 2019, Noga Levy-Rapoport, just 17 at the time, was instrumental in organising the massive 20 September climate strikes across the UK. This involved “months of tireless work – emails, backroom meetings, travelling from school to workplace to company HQs to persuade as many as we could to join us on the streets”. Levy-Rapoport, now a full-time student at Warwick University as well as continuing to energetically campaign, believes “the impact of that work can still be seen today”. If you could make one change… “I’d ensure governments and global leaders put an end to the greenwashing that corporations are constantly using. Greenwashing places all responsibility for an international, terrifyingly huge crisis on us as consumers, rather than on fossil fuel companies for taking advantage of our people and planet. Corporations like BP and Shell, responsible for so much damage to our environment, know that a decarbonised world is possible, a sustainable future and equitable society is possible, but for that to exist we have to end the unregulated power they have over our energy, jobs, and livelihoods.” KF A Colombian-American from Seattle, Margolin founded the coalition Zero Hour in 2017, which led the Youth Climate March the following July. She was one of 13 children who sued the state of Washington in 2018 for infringing their constitutional rights by “actively worsening the climate crisis”. She now studies film-making at NYU, continuing to campaign climate matters and queer rights. If you could make one change… “I would halt all deforestation and destruction of natural places.” KF “I was eight years old and attending a water ceremony in a First Nations community not far from mine,” says Autumn Peltier, recalling the moment that spurred her to become a clean-water advocate. “I went to the bathroom and all along the hallways there were signs that read ‘Do not drink the water’ and ‘Boil water advisory in effect’.” Quizzing her mother afterwards, she learned that the drinking water in this community, in northern Ontario, Canada, had been contaminated for 24 years. Now, aged just 17, Peltier is chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation. She first attracted attention when, at the Assembly of First Nations in 2017, she told prime minister Justin Trudeau that she was “very unhappy” with his record on water protection and oil pipeline projects. The following year, she addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on the subject of water pollution. “Those platforms tell me that my message is being heard and Canada has to answer at that level,” she says. “It shows me I’m being effective for the water, the children and our rights as indigenous people of this land.” If you could make one change… “I would encourage any new member of parliament to spend a week on the land and in a community that can’t drink water and live in the houses that need repairing. Have the ones in power experience what we are fighting for and why we do this advocacy work.” KF After attending a first climate school strike as barely a teenager, Grace Maddrell, at just 16, has now published Tomorrow Is Too Late (Indigo Press), a book of essays and stories by young activists from around the world illustrating why it is imperative that we act now to avert climate catastrophe. If you could make one change…. “This crisis has been caused by colonialism, capitalism, and inequality. If we could change the attitudes that perpetuate these things, it would help build a better world.” LO’K "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/297e327889e04dc2201a32c5a767faa8e5653963/0_443_1596_957/master/1596.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0ebf3d48e32c09c13e85697a4f7fd725","title":"coronavirus live auckland lockdown extended psychosis cases soar in england","story":"School leaders’ unions are concerned that 12- to 15-year-olds in England are missing out on getting the Covid vaccination in school due to a high level of cases amongst the cohort, as well as logistical problems with vaccination teams having insufficient staff to deal with students needing jabs. Three million pupils aged between 12 and 15 across the UK are eligible to receive a first dose of the Covid vaccine as part of a rollout that began a month ago. James Bowen, director of policy for school leaders’ union NAHT, said:  Ali insisted “I did not break any rules” after a report in the US in Harper’s Magazine claimed she “spent Christmas with the couple at No 10 despite pandemic restrictions on holiday gatherings”, PA Media reported. The north-eastern port has been the focal point of protest in Italy over the introduction of rules last Friday that require all workers show either proof of vaccination, a negative coronavirus test or recent recovery from infection. Police in full riot gear moved in this morning after several hundred dock workers disrupted access to one of the main gates at Italy’s largest commercial port, Reuters reported. The crowds were pushed aside by jets of water followed by volleys of tear gas. Many of them headed towards the city’s main square to continue their protest in front of government offices. “They attacked us. I am speechless. I never expected it,” said Stefano Puzzer, the spokesman of the port protesters. “We will sit down here. We are keeping calm. We will not give up.” The government says the mandatory health “green pass” is needed to keep workers safe and to encourage more people to get vaccinated. Under the rule, effective until year-end, workers will be suspended without pay and face a fine of up to €1,500 if they try to work without the certificate. Most Italians support the provision, opinion polls show.An interesting story from my colleague Mostafa Rachwani this morning, in case you missed it. In Australia, the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, has hit back at US senator Ted Cruz who criticised the Northern Territory’s vaccine policy, telling the firebrand Texan conservative “you know nothing about us”. The spat began when the US Republican shared a video of Gunner announcing the territory’s wide-ranging vaccine mandate for workers. “Inidual liberty matters,” Cruz declared, adding he had considered Australia the “Texas of the Pacific”. Gunner did not appreciate the feedback, responding on Twitter with a statement sharing a “few facts about Covid down here” and tagging Cruz. “We don’t need your lectures, thanks mate,” the chief minister began. “Nearly 70,000 Texans have tragically died from Covid. There have been zero deaths in the Territory. Did you know that? “We’ve done whatever it takes to protect the Territory. That’s kept us safe and free. We have been in lockdown for just eight days in 18 months. Our businesses and school are all open. Did you know that?” Gunner went on to say that Cruz knows nothing about Australia, and criticised his stance on vaccination. Russia topped the symbolic figure of 1,000 daily deaths on Saturday for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and hit a new record in infection numbers on Monday with 34,325 cases reported. Officials say the country is quickly running out of hospital beds and Russia’s chief doctor, Denis Protsenko, described the situation on Friday as “near critical” with vaccinations at a standstill. Several regions re-introduced QR codes for access to public places last week as well as mandatory vaccination for certain groups, but Moscow and St Petersburg - home to by far the biggest clusters of infections - have so far opted against new measures. The two cities are among most open places in Europe. “Russians have consistently shown more concern about the economic situation than the epidemiological one,” said Christian Fröhlich, a sociology professor at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics who studies public dissent. “People have very low expectations from the government and don’t expect to receive any support during a lockdown. This helps explain why many prefer for the country to stay open despite the deaths.” Read more of Pjotr Sauer’s report from Moscow here: ‘You reap what you sow’: Russians party despite record Covid figures That is all from me today, I will be back tomorrow. Tom Ambrose will be here shortly to continue bringing you the latest coronavirus developments from the UK and all around the world.First doses of Covid-19 vaccine began to be rolled out to all the UK’s 3.2 million 12- to 15-year-olds nearly a month ago. But Ian Jones reports for PA Media that figures for England and Scotland – the two nations currently publishing daily statistics on take-up – show wide variations across the countries. Take-up is also likely to have been affected by the level of infection circulating in the community. A first dose of vaccine cannot be delivered to someone if they are within four weeks of testing positive for Covid-19, waiting for the results of a coronavirus test, or self-isolating. Around one in 10 children in England in school years 7 to 11 were likely to have tested positive for Covid-19 in the week to 9 October – the highest rate for any age group – according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics.Von der Leyen goes on to say that she will be pressing world leaders at the G20 summit in Rome next week on the issue.Although the return to classrooms is a welcome change for parents and teachers, there are concerns that younger children will face social challenges heading back. With only two months left of the school year, she said her focus would be on getting him into the rhythm of school again and out meeting friends. “We’re excited … we’re excited to go back to the new normal. It’s a fresh leaf, a new chapter,” she said. Schools will look a bit different. Masks are now mandatory for high school students, and are recommended for primary school children. Teachers have been asked to keep the windows open for ventilation, but some classrooms have locked windows, and some worry about what will happen in summer when the temperatures soar. Kastner runs Australian school mums, a Facebook group with 5,000+ members, and says a lot of parents are confused about masks and concerned private schools in the state will get air purifiers while other schools may miss out.

About a third of adults in the country have had at least one Covid vaccine shot. The population of Russia is around 144 million peopleIn new phase 3 results reported today, Valneva said its vaccine showed superior neutralising antibody titer levels compared with the comparator vaccine from AstraZeneca. The company also said its vaccine – VLA2001 – induced broad T-cell responses, a part of the immune system believed to be involved in long-term immunity. PA Media reports that the phase 3 trial recruited 4,012 people across 26 trial sites in the UK. Thomas Lingelbach, the chief executive officer of Valneva, said: “We are committed to bringing our differentiated vaccine candidate to licensure as quickly as possible and continue to believe that we will be able to make an important contribution to the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.” Last month, the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva’s vaccine, with health secretary Sajid Javid telling MPs it had been “clear” the vaccine “would not get approval” by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillLitter in Ireland’s cities has worsened to levels “not seen in 10 years”, a new survey has found.The first post-lockdown survey by Irish Business Against Litter has shown that while the majority of Ireland’s towns have been cleaned up over the past 12 months, litter in the main cities has worsened.Dublin’s north inner city was branded a “litter blackspot” while Portlaoise emerged as the cleanest of 40 areas surveyed nationwide.An Taisce, which carried out the survey on behalf of Irish Business Against Litter (IBAl), said only two out of 25 sites surveyed in Dublin’s north inner city were clean.“What’s more, nearly 70 per cent of sites were heavily littered or worse, among them several that had been highlighted in previous surveys,” An Taisce said.After Dublin’s north inner city, the worst places for litter were Limerick city south, Drogheda, Ballybeg in Waterford and Dublin city centre.Ten years ago, Portlaoise was at the foot of the table but has now topped the rankings, an achievement praised by An Taisce as the result of “years of concerted effort and steady improvement”.Around the country, the number of areas deemed clean by An Taisce rose from 17 to 23 in the latest survey. In all, 68 per cent of towns showed an improvement on last year.Carlow and LongfordNotable improvement was seen in Tipperary town and in Carlow and Longford, which were both “cleaner than European norms”.“With local authority cleaning schedules normalising again and volunteer groups re-engaged in clean-ups across the country, our towns are almost as clean as two years ago,” Conor Horgan of IBAL said.However, this was “still some way short of where they were in 2014”, he said.The majority of urban areas fared worse than in 2020, among them Dublin, Cork and Limerick city centres, which were all deemed “littered”. Only Galway and Dublin’s Tallaght and Ballymun registered significant year-on-year improvement.“For cities, this survey paints a bleak picture,” Mr Horgan said.“Now that we have emerged from lockdown, we cannot use it as an excuse for high levels of litter.”Mr Horgan said city councils may be struggling to deal with “changes in behaviour around outdoor drinking and outdoor socialising more generally. They have increased the number of bins but nonetheless people are consuming more outside and it inevitably leads to litter”.This was a bigger problem in cities than in towns, he added.“As we invest in promotional drives and build city hotels in anticipation of more visitors, we need to be mindful of the littered environment we are presenting to them.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Growing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"bma head says forcing gps do face to face appointments harassment","story":"A new £250 million support package for general practice was announced by the Government this week, including plans to publish league tables showing how many in-person consultations GPs held.The worst-performing practices will be “named and shamed” and denied access to the new fund.The Health Secretary faced a fierce backlash to his plans from family doctors, who claimed he was “out of touch” with the crisis.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association’s council chair, said on Sunday that if practices were employees the treatment would amount to “harassment, discrimination, victimisation.“If general practice was an employee, it would claim harassment, discrimination, victimisation.”A “zero tolerance” campaign to tackle abuse and harassment of GPs will also form part of the plan.But Dr Nagpaul claimed the league tables will increase abuse.GPs and practice staff have said they face “daily” abuse from patients over access to in-person appointments.Dr Prakash Kachhala, 37, said a receptionist at his surgery in Nottinghamshire was in tears last week after facing abuse from a patient on the phone.“It’s daily and relentless,” Dr Kachhala, who works at Torkard Hill Medical Centre in Hucknall, said.“Patients (are) frustrated, understandably about waits and Covid precautions, but blame the hardworking staff that are trying to hold up a system in crisis.The Royal College of GPs has said the plan is not enough to tackle the crisis and that at least 6,000 full-time doctors are needed to tackle the workforce issues. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Online anonymity could end to combat \u0026#39out of control\u0026#39 abuse of MPs, Dominic Raab suggestsFormer US Secretary of State Colin Powell dies from Covid complicationsEmiliano Sala death: Man pleads guilty to flight chargeNo initiative can remove all the risks for MPs - but clamping down on the culture of abuse would helpRussia officials admit they failed Sputnik vaccination drive as Covid rates soar to record highDetoxing the Taliban way: Inside the clinic where Afghanistan\u0026#39s addicts are forced into withdrawalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have denial violent sickness british society","story":"As everybody debates the security of MPs and the tenor of our politics, we are in danger of missing a broader point. For we ought to be asking ourselves: what sort of society have we become?The suspect in the murder of Sir David Amess has been detained under the Terrorism Act and police have said that early investigations suggested a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism. We may not know the full details of this terrible crime for some time, but sadly, by then, our attention will probably have moved on.After the conviction of Wayne Couzens, for example, the police officer who murdered Sarah Everard, the country agreed the police had to change. Yet last week it emerged that West Midlands Police refused to answer Freedom of Information requests asking how many serving officers had been charged with rape. The answer, when it was dragged out of them, was three – in just one force – in the last three years alone.The examples go on. Five years ago, Jo Cox was murdered by a neo-Nazi, but the threat of violence from the extreme Right is growing. And this is not even our greatest danger. In Cox’s former constituency, Batley and Spen, a teacher remains in hiding after showing depictions of the Prophet Mohamed in a lesson, and the recent by-election there was marred by sectarian campaigning.We are in denial about the sickness of our society. We choose not to accept the reality before us – that hate, extremism and violence are commonplace – because that reality is scary, and confronting it is complex and hard. For many politicians, it means grasping issues that they find embarrassing, and saying what they lack the bravery to admit.This is especially apparent when it comes to hatred and violence perpetrated in the name of Islam. After so many plots and attacks, we have become inured to bloodshed. The pattern is always the same: we have a brief period of anguished conversation before returning quickly to normal.Commentators raise economic and social exclusion, but the perpetrators are often educated and well-off. Some raise foreign policy, as though extremism is caused by the wars of the last 20 years, rather than the other way round. Some blame our imperial history, as though Britain, uniquely, is targeted for crimes we committed, uniquely, centuries ago. Tell that to the people of Norway, who suffered their own terrorist atrocity last week.In other criminal contexts, we call this victim blaming. Instead, we need an honest conversation about why the attacks keep happening. After all, the danger mostly comes from citizens born and raised in Britain, educated in accordance with liberal and pluralistic values, and given all the opportunities of an open, modern economy.Over the last decade or so we have started to recognise the role played by extremist ideology. Where once we focused only on the sharp end – investigating terror plots, trying to stop bombs – we understand better the need to tackle the ideology behind the threat: the ideas of Sayyid Qutb, the Muslim Brotherhood and the iniduals and organisations related to them.But this is faint praise. We were foolish to tolerate this ideology for so many years. Even now, politicians and the public sector engage, sometimes deliberately, sometimes through ignorance, with people and organisations to whom they should be giving the cold shoulder. As they do so, they confer legitimacy and perceived power to extremists, and weaken those who would stand up to them. Without continuing political leadership, the public sector will keep falling into this trap, often from fear of being labelled an Islamophobe.Yet even focusing on ideology gives us false comfort. It is reassuring to say that we distinguish between the ideology of Islamism and the great religion of Islam. But people who are not Islamists can perpetuate extremist beliefs.Hardline attitudes and behaviour among some “community leaders” are often tolerated by those who would be first to condemn them in almost any other context. Barely disguised homophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitism, discrimination against others based on their race, religion or lifestyle, and the threat of violence towards apostates and atheists, is all too common, yet all too rarely confronted.This cultural extremism is if anything as dangerous as the ideology. It is more prevalent and easier to excuse. And it creates an environment in which ideological and violent extremism can grow. In addition to Batley, we have seen the intimidation of teachers who educate pupils about homosexual relationships, isive community politics in places like Tower Hamlets, and the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham, where hardliners took over secular state schools.Extremists wrongly claim that Islam and the West are fundamentally at odds, and say any criticism of their beliefs is a criticism of Islam and all Muslims. But the real ide is not between Muslim and non-Muslim, it is between those of us who accept the principles of living in a pluralistic society – and the norms and institutions that make it possible – and those who do not.To live in a pluralistic society is to accept a fundamental deal, in which you accept responsibilities, not just rights. You cannot just live how you choose to live, you have to respect others’ right to do so, too. And you have to respect our values, institutions and way of life: the rule of law, democracy, equality, free speech and respect for minorities.This is the real ide, and it must determine our response to extremism. We need a positive and self-confident account of our national story. And we need to accept that an “us-and-them” ide does exist, but we must decide where to draw the line. Choose the right side, choose pluralism and tolerance, we should say, and we will support you with everything we have. But choose hatred and intolerance and we will come down on you like a ton of bricks.Nothing about this problem is easy. Turning these principles into action, and making our society resilient in response to extremism, will be tough. But the first step is surely honesty about the sickness of our society.This time we must not retreat, in an absence of courage and thought, into complacency. We must admit and confront the very serious dangers we face.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Online anonymity could end to combat \u0026#39out of control\u0026#39 abuse of MPs, Dominic Raab suggestsArchie flies up the top baby names list after the birth of Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s sonFormer US Secretary of State Colin Powell dies from Covid complicationsEmiliano Sala death: Man pleads guilty to flight chargeNo initiative can remove all the risks for MPs - but clamping down on the culture of abuse would helpRussia officials admit they failed Sputnik vaccination drive as Covid rates soar to record highMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wont brits pick vegetables 30 hour","story":"Last year, with the pandemic preventing people entering the UK, David Simmons realised he would have to find local people to work on his farm near Hayle, west Cornwall. He went on local TV, appealed on social media and paid for adverts, and was happy with the result: more than 250 people applied for a role. But after ringing every single applicant, only 37 turned up for the induction and, after seven weeks of picking, just one worker was left.This is surprising when you consider the pay: if you work hard enough, you can get up to £30 an hour picking vegetables on Simmons’ farm, which works out to more than £62,000 a year pro-rata.To test the theory, I go to Cornwall to harvest broccoli on Simmons’ farm. I arrive at 8am, by which time the Russian and Ukrainian team I meet have already been out for two hours. I cut crowns from the stalk with a very sharp knife, twist off the biggest leaves, and toss them into a basket carried on a tractor being driven behind us. After half an hour of bending, cutting and tossing, I have already worked up a sweat: there is no denying that doing this for eight hours a day, five or six days a week, would be exhausting. But it still seems like an appealing proposition, given the handsome pay.Part of the reason wages are increasing for jobs like this is because the supply of lower-skilled workers is itself exhausted. For decades, hundreds of thousands of seasonal agricultural labourers would come to the UK to harvest our fruit and veg. But a mixture of Covid and post-Brexit changes to work visas meant that, last year, immigration became net negative for the first time in a generation.This may be music to the ears of the Government, which recently declared its aim of creating a “high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity” economy, one that focuses on attracting high-earning workers from abroad. Earlier this month, Cabinet ministers said that British industry had “got drunk on cheap labour” in recent decades, and built businesses that can only run when there are millions of people willing to come to the UK to do low-skilled, low-paid work. If they can’t find enough staff to fill these roles, well, tough, goes this argument: either raise wages to attract British workers, or invest in automation.As is common in agriculture, his pickers receive a ‘piece rate’, whereby they are paid more the harder they work, but are guaranteed the living wage as a minimum, which is £9.50 an hour hard-working staff receive more than £20 an hour. But despite the obvious incentive, Simmons struggled to motivate the British staff he hired. “They don’t see the benefit of it,” he says, and it showed in their work rate: last year, his British workers were consistently the slowest, and were thus the lowest paid.For the eastern Europeans that Simmons employs, the job’s benefits are pretty clear: you can earn considerably more than you ever could at home. And although farm work can be exhausting, it can also be the first step to leaving behind the poverty back home and building a new life in the UK. One worker, Denis, tells me that he earns so much money working on British farms for six months that when he returns to Ukraine, he barely has to lift a finger the rest of the year. “It’s hard work,” he says, “but I like it. The British don’t like it. They complain it’s very hard work.”In fact, the only British worker I find on the farm is 23-year-old Hedley Trenerry. He is immersed in farming: he rears livestock with his dad, and almost all his Cornish friends work in agriculture. “But none of them pick vegetables,” he says. “They drive a tractor or do admin they don’t do manual work.”The shortage of British manual workers could be down to a long-term trend of increasing education levels. In 1980, just 15 per cent of people were in full-time education after the age of 18, but today, more than half are still studying at that age. With greater education comes an expectation of higher-skilled employment – which means a graduate is far less likely to take manual work, even if it pays well.The other thing stopping Brits adopting the farming life may be that they are simply out of practice. I stop at a food bank in Wadebridge, a few miles from Simmons’ farm, where project manager Jacqui White has noticed that those who come in for help need more than just money: many have been out of work for so long that they have lost the social and personal skills needed to hold down a job. “Those people who have spent 18 months of the pandemic getting benefits or on furlough,” she says, “they think: ‘How on earth would I get up at 5am to work on a farm?’ We have to encourage people to work. We need to teach them the social skills, timekeeping and budgeting.”As it stands, the situation could have severe consequences for the British agricultural sector. This year, Simmons estimates that he had to leave vegetables worth upwards of £500,000 to rot in the fields, having been unable to recruit enough staff to pick them.He sees three ways out of this limbo. Firstly, visa rules could change to allow more “lower-skilled” migrants to take seasonal work on farms. Secondly, food prices could increase to cover the cost of paying British workers even more to attract them. Or, finally, many British farms could shut, costing thousands of jobs and leading to increased food imports instead.“The Government is saying we need to invest in better machinery,” he says. “But we can’t with no money coming in. If something doesn’t change, it’s curtains for us all.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Online anonymity could end to combat \u0026#39out of control\u0026#39 abuse of MPs, Dominic Raab suggestsArchie flies up the top baby names list after the birth of Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s sonFormer US Secretary of State Colin Powell dies from Covid complicationsEmiliano Sala death: Man pleads guilty to flight chargeNo initiative can remove all the risks for MPs - but clamping down on the culture of abuse would helpRussia officials admit they failed Sputnik vaccination drive as Covid rates soar to record highMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"giving last rites emergency service","story":"Hearing news of the attack on Sir David Amess last Friday, Father Jeffrey Woolnough rushed to the scene and asked if he might enter to give the MP the last rites. He says a policeman radioed in the request but it was denied. Fr Jeffrey, who did not know what condition Sir David was in – last rites are not performed on the dead, though, had the person just died, or if there was a doubt, the priest can anoint and absolve – respected this decision and prayed the rosary outside.I wrote to Essex Police to ask why they might turn away a priest tending to a believer and if they had a national policy on this subject. They replied that it was critical to protect the integrity of a crime scene and to allow emergency services to attend those in need, adding that “access to the scene is at the discretion of investigating officers”. This was confirmed to the  by the College of Policing, which states that currently there is no national guidance with regards to priests giving the last rites in such conditions.I find this incredible. And, as a Catholic myself, frightening.What’s all the fuss about? To Catholics (and some Protestants) the last rites are a final chance for a person to make their peace with God – confessing their sins, being absolved of those sins by the priest and receiving holy communion. (Sometimes, this isn’t physically possible, in which case we leave matters in the hands of the Lord.) The knowledge that one exits this world in a “state of grace” comforts the dying and their relatives.If it all sounds a bit bizarre, think of it in psychological terms: the Church is our family, God is the father, and all of us want to be close to our loved ones at death. To believers, the soul is actually more important than the body – thus the priest, in a sense, is an emergency service and should be treated as such. Many Catholics carry a card with them that states that if something awful happens, they want a priest present. I’ll be putting one in my wallet from now on.The lack of a national policy on the last rites implies that whether or not a priest gets access to a dying person might depend upon circumstances (understandable, because one doesn’t want to impede the police from doing their job) – or else, which is far less forgivable, upon the religious literacy of the inidual officer on duty.A few decades ago, in most situations I can imagine the police waving a priest through the barrier because they knew who and what he was and why it was so necessary that he be there. But in an era in which Christians are in a diminishing minority – and Christianity as mysterious to most Britons as voodoo or Morris dancing – this knowledge can no longer be assumed. This makes any absence of guidelines totally unacceptable. Time to write some.No one is second-guessing what the circumstances were on that horrible day I merely make a plea for religious belief to be understood for what it is to those who hold it, which is to say more important than life itself. Essex Police has a Twitter banner stating that it values “difference”. Hopefully this applies to Christians, too.Fr Jeffrey is a member of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, a society for former Anglicans, and Dr Nazir-Ali, who has converted to Catholicism after many years as a senior bishop in the Church of England, is about to join the ordinariate, too. It’s no coincidence. Ordinariate priests tend to have a bit of bottle – they gave up money and friends to become a Catholic, so they clearly and confidently believe in Catholic teaching.What will the English hierarchy make of Dr Nazir-Ali? An outspoken social conservative, he has left a Church that isn’t so sure what it believes any more to join a Church that knows what it thinks but prefers to keep quiet about it. The fact is that my Church’s teachings are exotic and stubborn (not just an unfashionable opposition to abortion but things like pilgrimages and holy wells that elites find risible), and much of the hierarchy – reluctant to contradict the spirit of the age, or even desperate to accommodate it – communicates its faith in language that is deliberately vague and inoffensive. A basic reason why people don’t know what the last rites are is because the Church has stopped telling them.The  hosted an event for my new book last week which you can now see on YouTube, and one of the questions our brilliant readers asked was: “What does more damage to tradition, communism or liberalism?” It’s the difference between tossing a frog on a fire and slowly boiling him. Revolution vs an imperceptible change that one might confuse for a warm bath.The culture of choice is so enticing, so easy, and the liberal society so focused on the present, that the idea of a world beyond this one has, for millions, become simply redundant. Yet the older I get, the more grateful I am for talking bushes and dog-headed saints – the beliefs that bring colour to a life led not for its own, brief sake but for the hope, someday, to look upon the face of God.

Yet many in the business world still question whether “Global Britain” is too vague a concept when it comes to commerce.That’s why the Government needs the very best advice from industry. And it’s why the Global Britain Commission, which I chair, launches today. I will be joined on the commission by the heads of blue chip firms and market leaders such as EY, Heathrow and Mace. It will offer a dialogue between business and government about how a truly Global Britain can be achieved, to support growth and provide the high value jobs on which our prosperity depends.The commission is a one-year project and its focus will be on working with government to define, shape and make a reality of Global Britain. It will use the experience, reach and expertise of all involved to support the Government in creating a blueprint for making the most of global economic opportunities.The task is urgent. We must act now, strongly and decisively, to ensure that we do not pass on mounting debt to future generations. Governments do not create jobs and prosperity – businesses do – but working together to ensure policy facilitates commerce can produce the best outcomes.The commission is of paramount importance in this of all years. Britain has played a key role in 2021 by hosting the G7 in Cornwall and will do so again in a few weeks when COP26 takes place in Glasgow. The latter’s focus on achieving net zero will be at the heart of this project. Even though the G7 countries represent only 9.8 per cent of the world’s population, they account for 36 per cent of global trade and 45.2 per cent of global GDP. What the United Kingdom does and says as a G7 nation matters to the rest of the world.But the next 12 months are critical for other reasons too, not just for our economy and the impact this will have on people’s lives at home, but for defining the essence of Global Britain itself. Our future trading relationships, now that we have left the EU, will only succeed if business and the government work together to deliver for British interests around the world.Global trade was shrinking before the pandemic and issues such as protectionism, especially among the wealthiest countries, must be tackled with a healthy dose of British free trade enthusiasm and the willingness to work with like-minded partners. If we are to enable developing countries to trade their way out of poverty, open markets with appropriate investment strategies by government and business, will be crucial.We must also ensure that everyone is able to benefit from capitalism, and governments can play their part by maintaining financial stability, open markets, and low taxes. It is imperative that our Government defends the UK’s position as an attractive place for firms to grow, free from the shackles of overburdensome regulation and taxation. We are the second top global destination for foreign inward investment and we need to keep it that way. But firms must accept their responsibilities in this process, too, paying their fair share of taxes and contributing equitably to economies across the globe.The Global Britain Commission will work with policy and trade experts, professional services and legal departments, ports and industry to achieve its aims. It will put forward practical policy suggestions based on the latest data, analytics insights, and modelling. I know that the CEOs on the commission’s board will agree that UK firms need to act positively, quickly and responsibly, giving their time and insight if we are to ensure that export-driven, high-growth, high-productivity sectors are to boost UK prosperity in an increasingly competitive world. Business also has a crucial role to play to support the Government in its global negotiations, as it is firms who trade, create jobs and attract investment.The prize is great if we can get this right. If the Government, with the help of willing partners in the best of UK commerce, can define what Global Britain truly means, then we can be an unstoppable economic force for good in the world.Liam Fox MP is a former defence and international trade secretary.

It comes as the brutal murder of Sir David Amess, who was stabbed while at a constituency surgery at a church in Leigh-on-Sea on Friday, sparks fresh concern over the security of MPs. The killing follows the death of Jo Cox in . Speaking to Times Radio, Sir Lindsay said: We should also know who is putting up on social media. We should know the person behind it. These fake accounts, when we donapost know who they are. Offshore accounts being used as well, for threats and intimidation.  When somebody threatened to put a bomb under my car, just recently, that was done from an offshore account. He added: Recently, Iaposve had a couple of death threats. Maybe itaposs because Iaposve got a higher profile of being the Speaker. People then they take exception and they think the answer is that thereaposs others to inspire to murder me and the threats being out there. These things happen. But what it wonapost do, it wonapost stop me carrying out the job Iaposm elected to, whether thataposs the MP for Chorley and the Speaker of the House of Commons. He saidsocial media companies fail to take action on online hate, then MPs should legislate. He said: We have got to take it seriously. The companies have got one chance. If it was up to me and I was in charge of legislation, I would have done something. We are working very closely with them, some arenapost working as well as they should do and they need to get their act together, he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel did not rule out scrapping online anonymity in an interview with broadcasters on Sunday. She said: “I want us to look at everything.  “There is work taking place already. We have an Online Harms Bill that will come to Parliament, there is working taking place on it right now. “I’ve done a lot of work on social media s, mainly around encryption and areas of that nature. “But we can’t carry on like this. I spend too much time with communities who have been under attack, basically who have had all sorts of postings online and it is a struggle to get those posts taken down. “We want to make some big changes on that.” Since Sir David’s death, MPs have been sharing their day-to-day experience of the threats they face.Senior Labour MP Ms Nandy, asked whether she felt safe doing her job in her constituency, replied: “No, not reallyI’m honest.”The representative for Wigan said she backed the idea of MPs being able to ask for police protection at public meetings.  “I’m not sure that we can ever eliminate the risk but there are other things that can be done to reduce the risk,” the shadow foreign secretary told Trevor Phillips during an interview on Sky News. “I think the suggestion from the Speaker about ensuring that anyone who wants or needs security at surgeries is a good idea, not least because people often know, evenwe don’t advertise them, that they are happening, so they can become a magnet for people who want to come and cause trouble.” Andrew Rosindell, the Tory MP for Romford, said MPs were “a little bit” frightened after Friday’s tragic events and that he would recommend not publicising constituency surgeries online. Speaking to PA in Leigh-on-Sea, he said: “The problem with social media is that it can be picked up by anybody anywhere. A bad person can see it and can suddenly turn up and this is clearly what happened with David.” Sir David had publicised his surgery at the church on Twitter several days before the attack.

The Cabinet Minister said we need to close any gaps in the safety arrangements for MPs following the Conservative backbencher’s killing. “We should, rightly, our elected representatives need to be able to go around with confidence - with confidence that they are safe and secure in the work they are doing,” she told the Trevor Phillips On Sunday programme on Sky News. Outlining practical measures MPs could take, she highlighted booking appointments in advance, checking the details of the iniduals that you are seeing, checking the locations in advance that you are going to, making sure that you are not on your own”. Ms Patel said there were “other things, linked to policing and security as well”. AskedMPs could receive the level of protection they receive in Westminster she said: All these issues and options are in consideration right now.  Sir David was stabbed multiple times while at a constituency surgery at a church in Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex, on Friday. Ali Harbi Ali, , has been arrested on suspicion of murder and terrorist cops are leading the investigation. Ms Patel has asked police forces to review security for MPs. Sir David is the second MP to be killed in recent years after Jo Cox was killed in . Ms Patel said while MPs “have all changed our ways of working because of changing concerns, threats in society”. This should never ever break that link between an elected representative and their democratic role, responsibility and duty to the people who elected them, she said. Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy admitted she did not feel safe carrying out constituency duties. Asked whether she felt safe doing her job in her constituency, the Labour MP for Wigan told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: No, not reallyIaposm honest.”But she added: MPs are well known in our constituencies, people tend to know where we live, we are out and about, weaposre normal human beings, we go out and about on the weekends and go to the local shops. Iaposm not sure that we can ever eliminate the risk but there are other things that can be done to reduce the risk.” She said ”ensuring that anyone who wants or needs security at surgeries is a good idea - not least because people often know, evenwe donapost advertise them, that they are happening so they can become a magnet for people who want to come and cause trouble”. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: We must say to Members of Parliament: be careful where you hold your constituency surgeries in a place that is protected but, at the same time,you need police protection that is going to be available. It need not be obtrusive, it need not be so obvious, but I think the protection has got to be made available now to Members of Parliament who feel that there is a risk to what they are doing. I think that will be introduced in the next few days.  The former Labour leader said that “the answer cannot be less democracy”. He went on: “The answer when you come across a terrorist incident is we donapost blink, we donapost shirk, we donapost flinch, we donapost show weakness and we stand up for what we believe. And, of course, we will increase the security that is available to Members of Parliament and councillors when theyaposre doing their surgeries, and that is something that must happen immediately. But itaposs true also to say that we must not allow our democracy to be diminished because a terrorist attack has occurred.

Some .million people claim both Disability Living Allowanceor its replacement Personal Independence Payment- paid to help people with the costs of being disabled - and Employment and Support Allowanceor its replacement within Universal Credit . In a Green Paper published over the summer, the Department for Work and Pensionssaid: “In future, we could look to create a new single benefit. “This could both provide support for disabled people and people with health conditions on low income and with extra costs. “Alternatively, a new benefit could have dferent priorities or a dferent set of objectives to our current system. “More focus could be put on supporting people with their extra costs, or on helping people to find and stay in work.” This has raised some fears for claimants - as PIP and DLA are paid regardless of wealth, while ESA and UC depend partly on your income. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said this month she is “not aware” of any plans to cut PIP, but did not rule out merging the benefits together. She told a Tory conference event “I don’t think we’re looking at” merging non-means-tested PIP with means-tested UC, and the reform would not be “just trying to force-fit dferent benefits together”. However, she added: “Everything is on the table is I think the best way of saying it, because the Green Paper is quite broad and we want to get some focus on genuine innovative thinking. “Are these benefits actually working, that’s the question I often ask my officials. Are they having the intended desire, andnot, what are we going to do about that ”  Ms Coffey also suggested she was concerned by the number of people claiming PIP for mental health dficulties, saying she wanted to “target that even more so to people who really need that support”. She added: “PIP has certainly grown in a way that was not anticipated when it was introduced. “To give you an example, three out of four young people who claim PIP have their primary reason being mental ill health. “That in itself is , young people who currently receive benefit focused on that. There may be other benefits they receive as well. “So that’s one of the things where I’m very conscious one of things I’m trying to do as Secretary of State is very much the issues we face are downstream, and what are the things we need to do to get more upstream.” At present, dferent assessments have to be held for PIP DLA and ESA UC - and the DWP reports people find it dficult and confusing to go through the same process repeatedly. Some have told the DWP that having more than one face-to-face assessment is extremely distressing.But others are worried that under a single benefit scheme, their finances would depend on the outcome of just one appointment, as also reported by BirminghamLive.The DWPsays keeping all these dferent existing benefits and having just one assessment wouldnapost work - but a brand new scheme would be a way to make the whole system simpler. At present, those with health conditions or disabilities who arenapost working or are on a low wage can put in a claim for payments under Universal Credit. Many are still on ESA , which UC is replacing. Separately, they can also apply for PIPto meet the extra costs of their condition, regardless of their income. It is worth a maximum of £. a week. Some still get the older benefit Disability Living Allowance, which PIP is replacing. The DWP Green Paper said: People who are on PIP as well as claiming either ESA or UC with a health condition currently go through two separate application and assessment processes. This means that people sometimes feel the same information is requested twice. The dferent purposes of the separate benefits are also not always clear to people claiming them. Some people have told us that having to go through two separate processes can be confusing and dficult. People told us that there needs to be a simpler application and assessment process. Some people felt that having a single health and disability benefit would help achieve this. Other people were worried about all their financial support depending on the outcome of one assessment. introducing a single assessment into the current system would not be beneficial. The benefits have been designed separately and each assessment considers dferent criteria.” It “added: If we were to introduce a new single benefit, depending on how this was designed and its objectives, it might be possible to use a single assessment. Alternatively, we might be able to simply access to this new benefit in some other way. The report added: We will consider the impact of any potential changes to the benefits system on the other benefits and support we provide for disabled people and people with health conditions. For example, changes to PIP, UC or ESA could affect benefits such as Carer’s Allowance and Attendance Allowance. We will look holistically at any changes we make, to avoid unintended consequences. We are committed to making any changes collaboratively, working with and listening to the people who receive and rely on our benefits. Universal Credit is also available to those without medical problems and, in those cases, people donapost need an appointment with a health professional. But any income and savings are assessed every month before the DWP decides how much money will be paid into accounts. Almost six million people claim UC, with numbers doubling during the pandemic.The standard allowance forUniversal Credithas now been cut by £ a month, following the removal of a coronavirus top-up that was provided from April  to September . Shaving off that boost - equivalent to around £ a week - has sparkedfears of financial struggles and poverty this winter.Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyDepartment for Work and PensionsMental healthDisabilityPoliticsDisability living allowanceCoronavirusBenefits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The former Prime Minister piled pressure on western nations to export surplus doses, as he blasted a lack of coordination in helping other countries inoculate populations against Covid-. A report due out tomorrow suggests about  million vaccines are sitting in Europe and the US which are unlikely to be used for months, he revealed. Mr Brown said the West has got to take action immediately to use these unused vaccines to save lives”. Many of them may go to waste - and that would be criminal - which could immediately be airlted out to those countries where the level of vaccination is so low that not even the nurses and doctors are protected - and certainly not the elderly and vulnerable,” the ex-Labour leader told Sky News. Boris Johnson promised at the G that he was going to vaccinate the whole world. He made this bold announcement that, by next year, everybody would be vaccinated who was an adult in the developing world as well as the developed world. But since then, so little has happened that we now face the possibility of every target being missed.”Experts have warned that leaving developing countries with far lower rates of vaccination than richer nations risked creating the conditions for mutant coronavirus strains - which could undermine the effectiveness of jabs.Challenged about his suggestion of criminality, Mr Brown said: “I was talking about neglect. “I do think that this is a lack of co-ordination. “IfPresident Biden, Boris Johnson, Ursula von der Leyen – the president of the European Union –Justin Trudeau came together, they would find that they had these unused vaccines that are not going to be used. “Even after all the boosters, there are excess vaccines that are not going to be used and they should get them out as quickly as possible.” He also suggested that Mr Johnson had missed a meeting, hosted by Mr Biden, to discuss getting vaccines sent to developing countries and said the PM should answer to the House of Commons about what role he played in that summit. A Downing Street source has said that the Prime Minister did miss his speaking slot, but said it was because the meeting was running late and he was due to attend a wreath-laying event at Arlington Cemetery in Washington DC.

Only half of eligible over-s have received a third dose of Covid vaccine one month into the programme, NHS figures suggest. Of the . million people over  who had a second jab more than six months ago, fewer than . million have had the booster. The UKaposs mass booster programme is a key part of the government’s winter plan, in addition to vaccinating children aged  to , and comes as Covid cases are rising. On Sunday the UK reported , new cases, marking the highest daily number since mid-July, and  new deaths within  days of a positive test, according to official data.  The number of people aged  to  admitted to hospital has risen  per cent in the past week admissions are up  per cent among people over . A reduced uptake in booster jabs is not surprising, according to Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care at Imperial College London.He told the Sunday Times: “There was always going to be a drop-off between doses. It’s likely that some people who got a second dose won’t get a third. They’re just not interested.“People were initially told that two doses were enough. They were in lockdown, and the vaccine was their ticket out of it. Now there’s much less incentive.”  Delays to the booster programme will have to be “resolved immediately” to avoid unnecessary pressures on the NHS, said Duncan Robertson, of Warwick University. “Booster vaccinations are there to prevent hospitalisations and ultimately to save lives. Delays matter,” he said. Those who are currently eligible for getting a third dose of the Covid vaccine are people are “most at risk from Covid- who have had a second dose of a vaccine at least six months ago,” according to the NHS. About  million people over the age of  and vulnerable adults will be offered boosters by the end of winter, but at the current rate of , a day, some in their early fties may not have booster jabs until mid-February – about eight months after most received their second dose.  Dr Simon Hodes, a GP in Watford, Hertfordshire, said: “I was pretty much in tears getting my first pizza boxes of Pfizer. But as time’s gone on, the desire has faded. People have pandemic burnout.” Prof Majeed said one factor behind the delay may be how the vaccinations have been organised. When the programme started, most over-s received it through their GP practices. “GPs are quite experienced in chasing people who won’t respond,” he said  Although some patients can still get a booster from their GP, the government has shted more to using hospital hubs and vaccination centres. “A lot of practices were told to stop vaccinating.” Those eligible are urged to book an appointment online or by phoning .

Ex-school friends of the alleged killer of MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death during a surgery meeting on Friday afternoon, claimed he became obsessed with Choudary and watched videos of him. British Islamist Choudary was jailed for five years and six months following a trial at the Old Bailey in  after being deemed to have invited support of ISIS. Convicted under section  of the Terrorism Act , Choudary was told by Mr Justice Holroyde he had crossed the line between the legitimate expression of your own views and a criminal act. After his release in  he was banned from public speaking, though this was lted in July. Ali allegedly booked an appointment to see the Sir David at Belfairs Methodist Church in Essex a week before the fatal attack, security sources have said. A pinned tweet to the father-of-fiveaposs public account invited people to book an appointment to see their MP at the church hall on Friday. A friend told The Sun : “Choudary was someone he became utterly obsessed with.Another ex-school pal said Ali was once a popular school boy who enjoyed football and socialising. They added: He had been a really lovely lad. A devoted ­Muslim and very popular. He enjoyed football and was very normal and we’d all go to the cinema. “He’d socialise and everyone really liked him.”  Police said on Friday they were treating Sir Davidaposs death as terror-related, with a potential link to Islamist extremism. The Met Police said on Saturday night they will now be able to keep the suspect in custody till October  under section  of the Terrorism Act . Ali, who is currently being held at a London police station, is a British national with Somali heritage.  He is understood not to have been known as a subject of interest to security service MI ahead of the attack. A tribute from the Amess family today said: The family would like to thank everyone for the wonderful, wonderful tributes paid to David following his cruel and violent death. It truly has brought us so much comfort. The support shown by friends, constituents and the general public alike has been so overwhelming.  As a family it has given us strength. We have realised from tributes paid that there was far, far more to David than even we, those closest to him, knew. We are enormously proud of him. Our hearts are shattered. However, there was still so much David wanted to do – this we know from the events of the last few days. So, this is not the end of Sir David Amess MP.

Demi Benbowaposs American bulldog Buster escaped from her property in Stoke-on-Trent and attacked another dog being walked by its owner on March . As the owner tried to separate the animals, he was badly bitten.The attack left the man in hospital for six days and he had surgery on both hands, StokeonTrentLive reports. Ms Benbow’s dog Buster has since been put down, magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard. Prosecutor Karen Wright said: It was pm and the victim left his address to walk his -year-old Siberian husky, Ice, on a lead. He walked past the defendantaposs address on Catharine Road and noticed the bulldog Buster in the garden. That dog left the property through an insecure gate and attacked his dog. The victim tried to stop the dog from hurting his dog by using his free hand to try to part them.  He was bitten to the thumb. It was a quite nasty injury. He let go of his own dogaposs lead and tried to punch the bulldog to the face. He was shouting and screaming. Neighbours heard the commotion and came outside. The bulldog was put back inside the owneraposs property. Miss Benbow came out and tried to help. She administered first aid to the injured party.” The court heard tensions were high and Ms Benbow made a  call to report what had happened. Of the victim, the prosector said: “He had to have his thumb reattached and has been told it may have to be removed. On his other hand, he has had four surgeries to reattach the tendons on his palm. Ms Benbow pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury. She was fined £ and ordered to pay an additional £ in court costs and charges. David Houldcroft, mitigating, said Ms Benbowaposs young son had left the front door and gate open, leading to the dogaposs escape. He said: She hasnapost really done a great deal wrong. The only thing you can criticise her for is allowing her son to open the door and gate, but it is dficult to keep your eye on children all the time, as many of us know. They acquired the dog as a family pet during the first lockdown. The dog had never attacked anyone before. It was not, on the face of it, an aggressive dog, it was scared of other dogs. This incident came out of the blue. She has taken full responsibility for what happened.

Wayne Haskett, from Cannock, houses his collection of medieval items which he has accumulated over the past  years in his realistic medieval-themed man cave in his garden. His obsession with medieval times started when he was a child and has grown over the years. Wayne even had a medieval and Game of Thrones themed wedding when he married his we, Claire, last year, for which he wore full knights outfits. Wayne says that when people walk into his man cave, which cost £, to complete, their jaws drop to the ground and they say it is like going back in time. The decision to build the themed shed began in lockdown last year, he said. He had around  items of medieval memorabilia that he had spent the past  years collecting, which had previously been displayed around the house.  My we, Claire, , also has an interest in the medieval times but she wasnapost so keen on all the stuff being around the house as she feels like itaposs her domain, ” Wayne said. So when I mentioned the idea of the themed man cave, she was very supportive because it meant all of the items would get moved out of the house and be used to decorate the Yawning Portal.” He predominantly built the structure himself, he said, with a bit of help from friends and family along the way. In total, it took around five months and cost around £k to complete. It has a fireplace with an original cast iron fire backplate to add to the middle ages theme, a make-believe well and an eight-seater table,” he said. And the walls are just plastered with my collections such as my French medieval tapestry, ornamental swords, old books and tankards to give it the medieval fantasy look I want.  Just outside the front of it, I have also created a Viking set up with a themed table and chairs where we like to have BBQs.” Itaposs all very realistic,” he added. Wayne’s love for medieval times has been growing since he was a child. He loved history lessons at school and playing games such as dungeons and dragons with his friends. In his twenties, he then started to collect historical items that were related to the middle ages and even went on to have a medieval-themed wedding. After meeting his we seven years ago, Wayne says that Claire had a little interest in medieval times which grew thanks to him and his passion.  The care worker said his Game of Thrones themed wedding last year had been “fantastic”, and insisted Claire had loved it as much as he did. I had all my ushers in full medieval attire and I was dressed as a knight. I was walking around in chain mail all day which was very heavy,” he said. Claireaposs dress also matched the theme. It was so good and everything looked great.” Wayne said his passion for medieval times had got him into “so many” enjoyable hobbies, including longbow shooting, Comicon events and martial arts.  Iaposm really happy with the medieval man cave that I created as it pays homage to medieval fantasy and Game of Thrones,” he said. I have collected all my pieces from ious places, such as antique fairs, emporiums and by searching online.” Having a place to go, to admire all of his items was great, Wayne said. “I like going down at night time with the fire flickering because I can really relax and take it all in.

YouTuber, Max Stanford, , from London, took on the plant-based powerhouse challenge in his latest upload for his channel, Max Vs Food. The burger is a new trial release product from McDonaldaposs which contains an entirely plant-based patty, with vegan cheese and a vegan sandwich sauce. Max challenged himself to wolf down , calories in the form of  burgers but only managed a respectable . He said, There has been a lot of talk about this new burger, and I always like to try new food items. Iaposm also keen on keeping myself updated with all the latest vegan products, to see what they are like compared to their non vegan equivalents.  It was something I knew I wanted to try for a food challenge. Max said he knew his  goal would be a stretch, and that burger number  snapped him back to the reality of how dficult the challenge was. He said, I was just trying to see how many I would be able to eat, and I knew I knew a target of  was ambitious but itaposs one to aim for. It was around the time I reached the th burger that I really started to feel the impact of the challenge.  The last  were a struggle so I was happy with my time of  minutes and  seconds, but I wish I could have finished the last ones a lot sooner. After I finished, I just went into a food coma, I was asleep before I knew it! Max described the taste of the burger as meaty, but not like a traditional beef burger. He explained, You could tell it was dferent to a regular beef patty, but it didnapost taste like the pea-based protein which itaposs made from. There was quite a bit of iation per burger, so some had lots of sauce which I wasnapost such a fan of as I liked the natural taste of the patty. The cheese and sauce tasted exactly the same to me in the burger and the bun was very similar too, but overall it was decent, and I think itaposs good for people to expand their horizons when it comes to food.  When people say they donapost like something without having tried it, I think thataposs just silly, give it a try and thenyou donapost like it then thataposs fair. Max resisted the urge to wash the burgers down with a traditional McDonaldaposs milkshake, and instead opted for some lighter soft drinks. He said, I did have some cola, ginger beer and a store-bought milkshake just to help me through the process. It sounds crazy but I actually put some whipped spray cream on the last burger to provide some sweetness as the flavour fatigue was so tough for the last ones. Maxaposs usual go to McDonaldaposs order is more traditional, and he has dabbled in McDonaldaposs challenges and other vegan challenges before as well.  He said, Nuggets or chicken selects are my go-to and Iaposve taken on a -nugget challenge before and won a contest where I ate  in  minutes to win £. I recently was part of a speed eating challenge where I had to finish a Papa Johnaposs jackfruit and vegan cheese pizza as one of the choices and it wasnapost good at all. But I had a vegan burger contest where I ate  in  minutes, and it was the Moving Mountains brand, beetroot-based patties which were really tasty.You can find Max on his Instagram page @maxvsfood_ Comment MORE ON Papa JohnYouTubeMcDonalds CorporationWorld recordsVegan\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And since stepping down as a senior royal last year, sheaposs gone back to holding ious roles after she and Harry signed several multi-million dollar business deals. In fact, just this week, it was revealed that the couple were entering the world of finance and becoming impact partners and investors of a sustainable investment firm called Ethic. And previously, in , Meghan offered her advice to women wanting to get ahead in the workplace and her biggest tips for becoming a girl boss.  She told InStyle magazine: I think the biggest part of being a girl boss in the office, at home, or anywhere you go is just knowing your value As you get older, you become more comfortable in your skin and comfortable in saying aposnoapos to things. Rachel is an example of that on television, and as The Tig has grown as a brand, I’ve also learned that saying aposnoapos is just as valuable as saying aposyes.apos  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. It’s something that, I think, comes with age and really having a sense of your self-worth. And then you make choices based on that. In the same interview, Meghan also gave her workplace fashion tips saying you should have a power piece in your wardrobe. She also advised staying out of office drama, explaining: I think in le and in the office, it’s best to stay out of the drama. You’ll be endlessly happier for it.  Harry and Meghan have signed a string of business deals since stepping down as senior royals and leaving the UK to head to Calornia.One is with Netflix, which they will work with to create content that informs but also gives hope.It is unknown exactly how much the deal is worth but it has been reported it could be worth  million. The couple has also signed a deal with Spoty, said to be worth £million to produce podcasts that promote “erse and inspiring voices” under the coupleaposs brand Archewell Audio. Meanwhile, last year, Meghan enlisted the help of her billionaire chat show friend Oprah Winfrey to help sell a vegan brand of coffee she had invested in. The Duchess backed the firm Clevr Blends – a start-up that makes instant oat-milk lattes – as she reportedly “begins to build a portfolio of startup investments”. However, the value of the deal is unknown.

And the top choice for both girls and boys remains unchanged this year - with Olivia and Oliver taking first preference among parents in England and Wales for the eighth year in a row. However, it seems these names tend to be most popular with older parents, as the data also showed that younger parents favoured shorter names like Leo and Theo for boys and Ava and Ivy for girls.  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that, for both boysapos and girlsapos names, the top  was slightly changed. Whereas Grace and Freya made the shortlist the previous year,  data shows those favourites had been replaced by Ivy and Rosie.And Charlie was knocked out of the top  for boysapos names for the first time since  - being replaced by Archie, which could have been influenced by Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs son.

Solihull Council told grieving Courtney Barnes, , that her sons Lorenzo and Jacksonaposs graves faced being disturbed when turf would be laid at Woodlands Cemetery.The local authority said the work would begin this autumn in accordance with cemetery regulations - just a year after the funeral, reports Birmingham Live. Courtney, from Chelmsley Wood, along with mum Tracy, , launched a petition after being given just four days notice to remove handmade decorations laid down for tots Lorenzo and Jackson.The -year-old, who on Friday miraculously gave birth to twin boys once again, had been told the family risked losing itemsthey were not removed in time.Mum Tracy claimed they would now only be allowed decorations on a small slab where the twinsapos headstone will eventually sit. When approached by BirminghamLive, Solihull Council apologised unreservedly for any distress caused and promised to give families more time to prepare.The original letter from the council, which has now been retracted, read: I am writing to advise you that your plot at Woodlands Cemetery will have new turf laid upon it this autumn in accordance with the cemetery regulations.The ground preparation will start on October ,  with the turfing commencing on October  which is scheduled to take  weeks to allow for any delays caused by the weather.To enable the grounds staff to carry out the works and to safeguard any decorations you have placed onto the grave mound, would you please remove these October  . Decorations can be placed upon the slabs, concrete or gravelled area at the head of the grave.  If you are not able to remove the decorations yourself the grounds staff will move smaller items to the head of the grave. Any grave frames in place will be disposed of as we do not have sufficient space to store them. Please be aware that we cannot take responsibility for any damage, loss or breakages soyou are concerned about the welfare of any item it is advisable that you remove this yourself. Once the turf has been laid items of any time will not be permitted on the grassed area of the grave. This includes frames surrounding the grave. Unfortunately we are not able to supply exact dates for when turf will be laid on a particular plot as the laying of the turf is dependent on weather conditions. Over the past two months, she said, they had worked hard to prepare a forever bed without knowing it would all be for nothing.  The grave currently includes fencing, stones, angels and a cross - all of which will have to be removedthey cannot fit on the narrow slab. She added: To me it is heart-breaking. We donapost want to go and destroy something that we have worked hard to do. Iaposve spent hours and hours in the garden painting things, everything on their grave is made by me. I didnapost buy anything from anyone, I made every item on there and it took me a long time. They are saying we can put things on the stone but the stone is about a foot wide. Tracey went on: Itaposs just passed  months since they were buried. Christmas is coming now. We usually put a little Christmas tree and stuff there. We canapost do anything. We canapost put anything on the grave.  The petition said families had been left mentally distressed - with Tracy and Courtney adding they just wanted to make the childrenaposs forever beds look beautul. This place brings me and other parents great comfort,the petition read. To be told they will remove [items]we do not is causing so much upset and pain. Have we not gone though enough  A spokesperson for Solihull Council said: “We would like to apologise unreservedly for the distress that this letter has caused. “The graves need to be turfed but we recognise that families need more time to prepare. We will give families at each cemetery four weeks in turn to move tributes and other items before work begins. “We anticipate this work will take approximately a month at each cemetery, subject to the weather.  “We would also like to reassure families that anything, apart from grave frames, that hasn’t been moved in time will be stored safely for a month and will be available for collection during that time. Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to store grave frames. “We will be writing again to all the families who were mistakenly sent these letters to both apologise and outline the correct timeline and procedures.” Comment MORE ON TwinsArtChristmas treesFunerals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shocking photos show how Emily Priceaposs face ballooned and her her forehead aposcurled overapos into her eyes after applying the popular beauty treatment. Emily, , from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, said she was left with red and crusty-looking brows after a trip to the salon on September . The mum-of-one thought she wouldnapost need a patch test as she previously used the product routinely - though hadnapost since the pandemic outbreak. She was initially happy with the results, but claims her eyebrows started to tingle an hour after having them done and it felt like a aposhot pokerapos on her skin. But when Emily awoke unable to open her eyes properly she became concerned. She was horried when her startled husband leapt out of bed clutching a mirror so she could see her swollen, weeping face. Emily rang her GPaposs surgery but was forced to simply describe her symptoms over the phone as she couldnapost get a face-to-face appointment due to Covid. With her face continuing to balloon over the coming days, Emily went to AE where stunned staff prescribed her with powerful antibiotics to tackle the infection. Emily fears her new allergic reaction could be a result of having had the Covid vaccine, after reading about links made between people having had Covid or having the vaccine and experiencing new allergies, however there is nothing to prove that. And Emily, who is double-jabbed with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, still remains a staunch advocate of getting the vaccine.  Emily, whoaposs never experienced allergic reactions in the past, watched in horror as her scabby eyebrows dropped off in patches - forcing her to colour them in with an eyebrow pencil. Now healed, writer Emily is now speaking out about her ordeal to ensure no-one goes through what she has and is urging people to always carry out patch tests, eventhey have previously not had an allergy. Emily said: An hour after I had them done I kept frowning and I realised it was tingling, like pins and needles. I thought maybe she left a little bit on so I gave my face a wash thinking it would get rid of any excess. As the hours went on it started to feel like when you burn yourself on a hot pan and you pull your hand away quickly. It was like that but it was asI couldnapost pull away from it, it was just burning hot like there was a poker across my eyebrows. I went to sleep and when I woke up there was a moment of panic as I couldnapost open my eyes properly, they were just slits. My husband was next to me, he turned the light on and looked at me and he was like aposoh my god whataposs happened to your face apos.  He ran and got a mirror, I could barely even see myself because my eyes were so swollen and I noticed that close, underneath the eyebrows, it had gone yellow. Days later I ended up going into hospital because it got worse. I looked like Sloth from The Goonies. An hour after having the beauty treatment Emily started to experience a tingling sensation and the following day she woke up to discover her face had ballooned. Worried at how it would develop, Emily managed to get a GP appointment over the phone on September th and was prescribed face wash, antihistamines and a steroid cream. But the medications did not help, and Emily took herself to Prince Charles Hospitalaposs AE department in Merthyr Tydfil on September  and was seen quickly by a skin specialist who started her on a strong course of antibiotics. She took a week-long course of antibiotics that cleared her skin but was horried when patches of eyebrow hair dropped out. Emily is sharing her experience to urge people to always get patch tested - claiming that although itaposs a apospainapos itaposs not worth being left aposlooking like a car crashapos. A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyspokesman said they investigate all reports of adverse effects from the vaccine. They added there is no current evidence to support Emilyaposs claim of the vaccine being responsible for her reaction.The agency recommends anyone experience adverse side effects from the vaccine to report it through he MHRA Yellow Card Scheme.Comment MORE ON AllergiesSkincare\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum has been diagnosed with it again now, but said the jab has made all the dferenceMum Anouska Black said every breath felt like glass when she first got Covid but that changed when she was jabbed Image: Anouska BlackByApril Curtin:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA mum whose lung nearly collapsed when she was first struck by Covid- said the jab made all the dference when she contracted it a second time. Anouska Black, , from Co Down, Northern Ireland, said her body has been through trauma after she was originally diagnosed with the virus back in September . She said she completely randomly had an asthma attack and before she knew it she woke up in hospital with a lung that had nearly collapsed.The mum and step mum, from Magheralin, told Belfast Live : Thataposs actually how I found out I got Covid.The NI pageant queen was in and out of hospital for days before receiving a phone call to give her the dreaded news – she had the virus. She said: It kind of attacked my brain and my digestive system.  Anouska had no cough, temperature or loss of taste or smell. Instead, she suffered severe migraines, vomiting and diarrhoea – while sleeping around  hours each day. Three months after being diagnosed, the -year-old was still not getting better, and said every breath felt like glass. By December, she was back in hospital. Anouska said: Living it all again that second time, knowing youaposve got Covid, there was no messing about, it was really scary. I think my mum still has PTSD from it. Her anxiety went through the roof. The mum was put on tablets and given a full treatment plan. She has since gained multiple allergies, and in April, she was diagnosed with long Covid and post-Covid anxiety.  Speaking about her anxiety, she said: I thought I was fine but the doctor actually said my body basically is showing signs of anxiety. My whole breathing pattern has changed. You can see my body has been through trauma. Now, a year after catching Covid, Anouska has just tested positive again, despite being double jabbed since catching it the first time. I couldnapost believe it to be honest, she said.Can you catch Covid- twice It is possible to catch Covid twice, though it is unlikely. It’s not yet known how long Covid- vaccine protection lasts. Studies have shown that, for most people, catching the virus means you should be protected from getting it again for at least five months. But this depends on each inidual, and while it is unlikely, people have been known to catch Covid twice in a short space of time. Data indicates fully vaccinated people are much less likely to catch Covid- twice than those who are not. Earlier in October, Anouska broke out in an almighty red rash and said her teeth were chattering. She thought she was having an allergic reaction but has since been told could have been a symptom Covid and has tested positive.Her partner also has coronavirus and they have both also been diagnosed with mild pneumonia.Sharing a warning about Covid, Anouska said: When you canapost breathe, it is literally the scariest thing in the entire world. Itaposs like drowning with air. Do not hang about with this -you feel sick ring , ring your GP. Speaking about the vaccine, she said: I really believe it has saved me from going into hospital again. It hit me so hard last year. I was in hospital, I could have died. Thereaposs such a dference between the first time and the second time. And the only dference is, Iaposve had the vaccine. I would not have liked to have taken a chance the second time. She wanted to alert people to other symptoms of Covid, and said: Itaposs not just those three [symptoms]. Thereaposs no harm in staying up-to-date with the news. Anouska wants to encourage others to give people personal space and consider doing big shops again instead of taking unnecessary risks. She said: People have become so complacent. Le has to get back to normal, but just respect each other.

They described how a year and a half ago they were ready to make an offer on a croft down the road when a twist of fate made them bump into Tommy McLean. He was the nephew of the former owner of the plot they have bought - a fantastic, th century farm they plan to become modern crofters on. Talking to the Daily Record, Grant said: We were looking at crofts and we were about to put an offer on one down the road when we saw this guy coming up the road on his old  tractor and that was Tommy McLean, the nephew of the former owner.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments below  “We were speaking to him and we said, we’re looking to buy a croft and he said aposwell I have one that I’ll sell to youapos. If it wasn’t for bumping into him on his tractor, this might never have happened. Looking to integrate themselves into the local community and avoid contributing to the islandaposs housing shortage, theyaposre going to build their own home. The couple got married at an ancient stone circle, Calanais, on the island in  while living in Glasgow, then moved to Nairn, Highlands, before selling their house and moving to a more remote spot, the Daily Record reports. They are now living out of a caravan while they reuse and recycle the ruins of a derelict croft into a new road and a new eco-home. They also plan to fertilise the land with kelp to grow vegetables as well as rearing Hebridean sheep. Grant and Sharon, who is from Edinburgh, were keen not to have a detrimental impact on the quality of le of islanders - as a boom in second home ownership has made it harder for young people to afford properties.  Grant said: “Part of the reason we’re building a house is that we didn’t want to buy an existing home because there are lot of people coming to the islands and doing that and a lot of holiday lets. There is still a drain on the island in that respect and things are getting more expensive here, as they are everywhere.” Chairman of the Scottish Crofting Federation Donald MacKinnon, warned earlier this month that the market for crofts was “completely out of control”. The runaway price resulting as a result is in turn putting the plots of land well out of the reach of young people. Part of Grant and Sharon’s long-term plans include aspirations to eventually open their land up as a mentoring space for others to learn the ways of crofting - and they have just welcomed their first chickens. They are living in a caravan while contractors work on the croft, which dates back to  when it was first used as a smallholding. They hope to feed themselves in part with fruit and vegetables, including kale, potatoes, cabbage, leeks and onions, as well as eggs from their hens, grown on-site, in the manner of traditional crofters.  Grant worked on a dairy farm in his younger days in England and has experience growing grapes and passionfruit as well as sheep shearing from living in the Australian Outback. He was drawn to the “history and mystery” of the standing stones near their new home. Grant said: “It was fantastic, these stones dating back  years and no one really knowing why they are there or what they were there for. “Everyone has their theory but no one really knows. “The timeless landscape of Lewis always draws you back and the many moods on the island, the beautul light. “You can stand up at the stones there and look out southwest and the landscape pretty much hasn’t changed for hundreds of years.  “We always wanted to move and we spent a lot of time here but we never imagined that we would actually pluck up the courage to. The ruined house is being dismantled to make way for their new home, and relics from it are being recycled and reused - including an old tub where sheep were once gutted by former owner Donald McLean, whose family owned the croft from  until now. Stones from the old house have been used to build a road and beams from the roof will be made into planters for growing produce. A new, well-insulated,  square-metre, two-bedroom structure will house the couple and will be warmed by a source heat pump, an eco-friendly heating system. Grant said: “We’d been thinking of doing this for years, before adding they hope to get everything finished by spring timeweaposre lucky. “It’ll be done when it’s done. As regards the croft, that is going to take a long time. Vegetables are being grown in a polytunnel but without modern pesticides and the couple hope to be rearing native black Hebridean sheep by next year. Sharon, who now works at the Callanish visitors’ centre, said: “I’d like to bring people here who can hugely benefit from being around animals in this kind of environment, as well as teenagers who are maybe up to mischief in schools.“By next year we should have our own vegetables, the sheep and maybe lambs as well.“We’re debating getting pigs as well but they’re supposed to be very good escape artists.” Comment MORE ON House pricesTeenagersproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So rather than seeing  types of pasta you might see ten. “Or they might decide they don’t need nearly as much bottled water which is bulky and large in the shop. “It’s a tough and evolving situation and hard to say what will happen right now.  It comes after transport secretary Grant Shapps said the Government would relax cabotage rules on the number of deliveries EU drivers can make to an unlimited amount over a -day period. Ministers announced earlier this month that overseas drivers can take up six-month visas and plan to have the two-week unlimited deliveries scheme in place for December. Just  foreign drivers have so far been issued, the Government has said, as gaps remain in supermarkets and containers are left waiting at ports due to the staffing crisis.  But Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy and public affairs at the Road Haulage Association, accused the Government of pulling the lever marked ‘uncontrolled immigration’ as he claimed the scheme will lead to EU drivers undercutting UK workers. “The Government clearly wants to save Christmas and be seen to be saving Christmas, and extra drivers will clearly help Christmas deliveries, so, from a simple, populist point of view, you can see what they’re doing,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “But there are consequences for hardworking UK hauliers who are suffering under a weight of staff shortages, poor roadside facilities, ridiculous waiting times to load and unload, and this simply doesn’t help UK haulage.  “We don’t want cabotage to sabotage our industry.” He added RHA members were appalled at the emergency scheme, adding that ridiculous, pathetic, gobsmacked had been some of their more broadcastable comments. He said: “The Government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy and not pulling the lever marked ‘uncontrolled immigration’, and to them this is exactly what it looks like. “Allowing overseas companies and drivers to come over for perhaps up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers. “So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don’t pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers.” A Government source hit back at the intervention by the RHA, telling the Mirror: Itaposs a bit rich coming from the RHA which has consistently lobbied for theof cheap European drivers.

Donapost f*****g smile. The woman can be seen smiling, but it is not clear what she says in response. He can then be heard shouting at her again saying: Donapost taunt me or Iaposll knock you the f**k out you c***. The woman does not back down at his threats and refuses to cower, saying: If you call me a c*** Iaposll call you a c***. The man then walks towards the woman at speed and squares up to her, forcing her to back into the door of the carriage and press into the plastic ider. At this point a number of men who have been watching the incident unfold leap to their feet to pull him away from the woman and force him to leave the carriage.

So, what’s going on  Greg Murray, a psychology researcher with expertise in mood, sleep and the circadian system , has explained why this happens.  Professor Murray says: “In a normal night’s sleep, our neurobiology reaches a turning point around  or am. “Core body temperature starts to rise, sleep drive is reducing , secretion of melatoninhas peaked, and levels of cortisolare increasing as the body prepares to launch us into the day.“Remarkably, all this activity happens independent of cues from the environment such as dawn light – nature decided long ago that sunrise and sunset are so important that they must be predicted .“We actually wake up many times each night, and light sleep is more common in the second half of the night. When sleep is going well for us, we are simply unaware of these awakenings. But add a bit of stress and there is a good chance that waking will become a fully self-aware state. “Not surprisingly, there is evidence the pandemic is a sleep-disturbing stressor. Soyou’re experiencing am wakings at the moment, you’re definitely not alone. “Stress also impacts sleep in insomnia, where people become hypervigilant about being awake. “Concerns about being awake when one “should” be asleep can cause the person to jolt themselves into anxious wakefulness whenever they go through a light sleep phase.  “If that sounds like you, be aware that insomnia responds well to psychological treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy. There’s also a strong link between sleep and depression, so it’s important to speak to your doctoryou have any concerns about your sleep.” “As a cognitive therapist, I sometimes joke the only thing good about am waking is that it gives us all a vivid example of catastrophising,” Professor Murray says. “Around this time in the sleep cycle, we’re at our lowest ebb physically and cognitively. From nature’s viewpoint, this is meant to be a time of physical and emotional recovery, so it’s understandable that our internal resources are low. “But we also lack other resources in the middle of the night – social connections, cultural assets, all the coping skills of an adult are unavailable at this time. With none of our human skills and capital, we are left alone in the dark with our thoughts. So the mind is partly right when it concludes the problems it’s generated are unsolvable – at am, most problems literally would be. “Once the sun’s up, we’re listening to the radio, chewing our Vegemite toast and pushing the cat off the bench, and our am problems are put in perspective. We can’t believe the solution of just ringing this person, postponing that thing, or checking such-and-such was overlooked in the wee hours.“The truth is, our mind isn’t really looking for a solution at am. We might think we are problem solving by mentally working over issues at this hour, but this isn’t really problem solving it’s problem solving’s evil twin – worry.“Worry is identying a problem, ruminating about the worst possible outcome and neglecting the resources we would bring to bear should the non-preferred outcome actually occur.” Professor Murray adds: “Have you noticed the am thoughts are very self-focused  In the quiet dark, it’s easy to slide unknowingly into a state of extreme egocentricity. Circling round the concept “I”, we can generate painful backwards-looking feelings like guilt or regret. Or turn our tired thoughts to the always uncertain future, generating baseless fears. “Buddhism has a strong position on this type of mental activity: the self is a fiction, and that fiction is the source of all distress. Many of us now practise Buddhist-informed mindfulness to manage stress in the daytime I use mindfulness to deal with am wakings. “I bring my attention to my senses, specically the sound of my breath. When I notice thoughts arising, I gently bring my attention back to the sound of breathing . “Sometimes this meditation works. Sometimes it doesn’t. If I’m still caught in negative thinking after  or  minutes, I follow the advice from cognitive behavioural therapy, and get up, turn on dim light and read. “This action may seem mundane, but at am it is powerfully compassionate, and can help draw you out of your unproductive thinking. “One last tip: It’s important to convince yourselfthat you want to avoid catastrophic thinking. For good reasons not to worry, you can’t go past the Stoic philosophers. “Waking and worrying at am is very understandable and very human. But in my opinion, not a great habit to get into.” Comment MORE ON Mental healthInsomniaTherapySleep\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When Nicola published the footage online, some people told her to contact the police to report the incident. She said she contacted Merseyside Police but is now terried of leaving the house alone with her dogs in case there are attempts to steal them.  Nicola said: I had just popped out with my son and could see on my phone they were at the door so I got home as quickly as possible and then I watched the video. Our front door has glass and you can see straight through, when Iaposm in we have the curtain closed over it but thataposs dficult to do as youaposre going out of the door. The man rang our normal doorbell not the ring bell and you can see the dogs are going mental. When I watched it at first I didnapost realise what heaposd said, but then I watched it again. One of our dogs is a fluffy white thing and you can see him look in the direction of the kitchen and say apospomeranianapos and write it down. I have no idea why he said it out loud like there. Itaposs not a Pomeranian but I suppose it could look a bit like one. She said that after posting the footage on the Crimewatch Wirral group, some locals said they had witnessed similar incidents before. The woman added: When I rang the police and they were really helpful and apparently there were a few reports of dogs being targeted in this way. A lady who lives up the road said someone she knew had that happen to her and now Iaposm petried of leaving them in the house. Iaposm scared to go for a walk with them in the dark on my own and wonapost do that now. Iaposm worried now about what will happen. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: We were contacted at .pm on Thursday th October, by a resident of Frankby Road in West Kirby following reports that  minutes earlier a man had been seen on her Ring doorbell looking through her door and window. The male left a short time later. There is no suggestion he attempted to enter the property. Local policing officers have been made aware.

The restaurant chain, known for the tight-fitting unorms worn by its female staff, has now said it will allow employees to “choose” which unorm they wish to wear.In a statement to Insider, a spokesperson for Hooters said: “As we continue to listen and update the image of the Hooters Girls, we are clarying that they have the option to choose from traditional unorms or the new ones.They can determine which style of shorts best fits their body style and personal image. It followed its previous decision to replace already-short shorts for new skin-tight, bikini-cut bottoms, which some of its staff compared to underwear.  A series of viral TikTok videos shared by Hooters staff show employees speaking out against the shorts while others have threatened to quit as a result of the unorm change. “Oh look, a wedgie!” Hooters employee and medical student Kristen Songer, , said as she revealed the new shorts. “This is why all the Hooters girls are upset — because this is not what I agreed to wear a year ago when I was hired.”  In another video, one person compared the two shorts with the caption: “Love my job but don’t love wearing undies to work.” Another TikTok user said: “Soooo Hooters got new panties. I mean shorts.” The unorm change did receive positive feedback from some staff, one who said she was obsessed with the shorts while another asked Am I the only Hootie that loves the new shorts    “I’ve been making way more money with the new shorts,” a third said. Hooters has repeatedly come under fire for promoting the objectication of women through mandatory barely-there unorms, as well as staff beauty pageants and girl calendars.

The -year-old always saw the good in people, which meant she treated everyone she met like a friend.But it also made her vulnerable and prone to being hurt.In , Alexandria – known as Ally and originally from St Louis, Missouri – was studying for a marketing degree at the University of Mississippi, in the city of Oxford, USA.She also taught fitness classes on campus and had started a golf club. In her freshman year in , she had met business student Brandon Theesfeld. Although they had never officially been a couple, they had dated on and off over the years. Ally’s friends knew that she had fallen for Theesfeld, but that he didn’t treat her very well and could be emotionally abusive. She would show them texts of him blowing hot and cold with his affections – saying he loved her one minute and then denying it the next.Students said Theesfeld was arrogant and liked to brag about his family’s wealth. Some even called him a misogynist. He liked to play the field and wasn’t committed to Ally. But Ally had some news for him.In April, she messaged Theesfeld to say she thought she might be pregnant.She sent him a picture of an inconclusive home pregnancy test and told him they needed to talk.Theesfeld started to ignore her messages and rumours started to circulate around campus.Ally’s friends heard she might be pregnant and other students heard that Theesfeld wasn’t very happy about it and wanted her to have an abortion.He thought a baby would ruin his le and his future.Ally tearfully told her friends she didn’t want an abortion.She wanted Theesfeld to meet her but their communication was purely electronic for the next three months. Ally had no clue just how badly the potential baby news had gone down. Theesfeld’s internet history showed he was researching abortion pills and services. And he travelled home to Dallas, Texas, and posted a photo on social media of a Glock pistol his dad had bought. The caption read, “Finally taking my baby back to Oxford.”On  July, he started to research gun silencers, ammunition and tactical face masks. Theesfeld also looked into how serial killer Ted Bundy had lured his victims to their deaths.Occasionally, he would agree to meet Ally but cancel at the last minute or not show up. On  July, Ally was out for the evening. Surveillance footage captured her leaving a nightclub in Oxford before midnight.She walked along and was looking on her phone. After ing home, she slipped out again without her roommates noticing.Then, at around .am the next day, a routine police patrol discovered a body in the remote area around Sardis Lake – a popular place for students to hang out, about  miles from downtown Oxford. The body was identied as Ally.She had been shot eight times in the stomach and her purse was found dumped a mile away. Straight away, Theesfeld was the prime suspect. He had messaged Ally the night before, asking her to tell him when she was leaving the bar.His truck was seen heading to her home around am, then towards the lake. Gunshots were heard at around .am at the lake and Theesfeld’s phone placed him leaving the area  minutes later.The bullets used to kill Ally were also the type for the gun he’d bragged about on social media.On  July, Theesfeld was arrested at a petrol station in Tennessee and charged with capital murder.He had blood on his clothing and his gun was found in his truck. It was matched to the bullets that killed Ally.Investigators determined that he had lured Ally to meet him and killed her to stop her having the baby.Tragically, an autopsy found Ally had not been pregnant after all. Had she really believed she was  We will never know.Theesfeld was facing a death sentence on the capital murder charge, so he made a plea deal.This August, Theesfeld, , pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The prosecution said he had been unhappy believing that Ally was pregnant. They spoke about a letter he had written to his family, which was found after his arrest.“I’m not a good person. It is not your fault,” he wrote. “Something in me just doesn’t work. I’ve always had terrible thoughts. I know I’m going to get caught.”The prosecution said Theesfeld had tried to pressure Ally into getting an abortion and he had messaged suggesting that he had “felt becoming a father at this point in his le would ruin his le”. So he had taken his gun and lured Ally to her death, driving her to the lake and repeatedly shooting her.Afterwards, he had even looked up “Sardis, Mississippi news” – presumably to seeher body had been found. The defence agreed after a mental evaluation that Theesfeld was sane and competent to face trial.But they claimed drugs and alcohol influenced his behaviour.In September this year, Theesfeld faced sentencing. He apologised to Ally’s family but had no explanation for his terrible crime.“My actions have forever changed your lives and my family’s lives,” he said.“I wish I could take it all back but I can’t. There is no excuse for my actions. I hope one day that you will find it in your hearts to forgive me.”Ally’s heartbroken mum, Cindy, had written a letter that was read out in court, describing Ally as “bright, compassionate, sweet and hardworking”.It went on, “I wish I could have kept her away from this evil, callous, scheming, ungrateful, sinister and violent and corrupt monster. He had every opportunity to do good in the world but he chose to do evil. “Brandon, you belong in jail each day for the rest of your le for the heinous act you committed to such a sweet soul in Ally. Every time your cell door slams shut, may it be a reminder for what you did and the le you took from us.”Theesfeld was sentenced to le in prison and will be eligible for parole when he is . The case that had rocked the university two years earlier had finally come to an end. Ally’s family, who had worn pink in her memory, asked the community to always remember her – to honour her the way she’d been committed to them.They want the way she lived her le to be remembered, not the terrible way she died.Ally had always tried to take the positive out of every situation and now her distraught family are trying their best to do the same.Comment MORE ON University of MississippiPregnancyLe sentenceMurder trialSerial killersCrimeAbortionSurveillance\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You will need to fly to Jakarta, Indonesia to do so - and best to hurry, as the challenge has already proven extremely popular. Cafe Strawberry was inspired to jump on the bandwagon in a bid to fuel its pandemic recovery by recreating some of the games from the gory show. In a dark room lit with neon colours, customers are welcomed by staff dressed as the ominous masked guards, who are holding toy guns. They are ushered towards the end of the room where the chilling red light, green light playground game starts.

You canapost really beat a chain which specialises in a good old Sunday dinner, can you  Or so you might think. According to TripAdvisor, many diners would disagree, with one particular branch of the restaurant chain taking a particular beating on the rating site.A Toby Carvery in Oldhamaposs Chadderton Park, in Greater Manchester, has been branded the worst place to eat ever, prompted the Manchester Evening Newsapos journalist Hana Kelly to go and check it out for herself.Food awful service even worse, worse place to eat ever, one review reads, while another diner wrote: Donapost have the Yorkshire puddings unless you want to lose a tooth or two. However, others tell of vastly dferent experiences as one reviewer writes: Amazing food, nice and warm, good service  good options. The server was fast and the food was cheap, but what did Hana think  Hereaposs her review.  What’s cooking  A delicious plate, full to bursting with fluffy yet crunchy roast potatoes, a Yorkshire pudding so crisp and rosy, it almost seems a shame to coat it in a thick, rich gravy. The veg should have a crunch, a sweet flavour to counteract the savoury deliciousness of the meat and the mix of trimmings, from stuffing to sauces should capture your senses before you’ve even taken a bite. At this Toby’s, the offering hit maybe % of this description. The Yorkshire pudding: truly faultless. It was golden with a crunch to match autumn leaves. The gravy: thick, flavourful, available in both meatysaurus and vegetarian options. The rest: Eh, acceptable. The turkey was dry. The kind of dry that meant when the carver was carving it, it cut not in slices but in small, frayed chunks like sawdust. The potatoes, in roasted form, were crisp on the outside and that’s that, no fluff, not much flavour. Meanwhile in mashed form, they were sweet and goopy. The vegetables were acceptable, certainly nothing worthy of review.  Are you being served  The enjoyment of post-Covid self service was definitely something missed by the patrons of the Chadderton Park Toby Carvery. One reviewer, who left one star on Tripadvisor, described the lack of self service during the pandemic as ‘not enjoyable at all’. They said: “The carvers throw it all on a plate on top of each other so it looks like a dogaposs dinner. But low and behold, self serve has ed, once your meat and Yorkshire are safely home on your plate, you can choose your own. A smiley waiter leads you to a table, takes your drink order and lets you know you may head for the carvery when ready. I sat for a few minutes contemplating what it meant to be ready before realising I just needed to get my dinner. However, this doesn’t mean there isn’t still confusion over the systems. One couple waited at their table for over  minutes wonderingthey’d been forgotten before flagging down a waiter and discovering they were meant to serve themselves. What’s the damage  If there’s one thing for certain, for a full roast the price is right. At a wonderfully affordable £., it is a good deal and great value for money. The verdict  As a Toby Carvery first timer, the meal was sadly disappointing. The staff were polite and relaxed, explaining the process, and serving drinks and the bill quickly. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, with laughter heard from many tables and tasty gravy smells wafting all throughout the pub. The queue at the carvery station was non-existent, meaning my food was still piping hot back at the table. There was ample parking, but the pothole ridden car park could have destroyed a caraposs suspension. But for a pub that sells itself on its roast, I’ve definitely cooked better.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Northern Territory Police said the pair, who had gone missing in the area of the Arlparra and Harts Range were later found after a frantic search by officers and the public.

Police said they wanted to thank all of those involved in the search.

But did you know it can also cause problems with your bones Dr Atiyah Kamran, a consultant gynaecologist at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, says it#s important for women to look after their bone health to avoid osteoporosis.When women reach the age of menopause their oies stop producing high levels of hormones in the body.During the reproductive years, the hormone oestrogen helps to thicken the lining of the womb and stimulate the growth of egg follicles.But it#s also important for helping other parts of the body, contributing to our cognitive health, the cardiovascular system and how we absorb calcium.Oestrogen helps to protect our bones and, when levels of the hormone start declining in our s and s, it can lead to bone loss.A woman can lose up to % of her bone density during the five years following menopause which can lead to osteoporosis.Their bones become thinner causing them to fracture more easily.Today, on World Menopause Day, Dr Kamran has given some advice on how we can protect our bones.In the first instance, women should talk to their GPs to find outthey are likely to be suffering from menopause.Doctors can usually confirm it based on your symptoms butyou#re under the age of  a blood test can be taken to measure your hormone levels.Dr Kamran says it could be the case you#ll benefit from hormone replacement therapy , which will help replace lost oestrogen.#Not everyone needs HRT after menopause buta woman is suffering and her quality of le is suffering and she wants some relief from it then the options are available,# Dr Kamran said.#Every woman should have the right to ask.#Yes, there is. Dr Kamran says taking supplements and certain exercises can help.#Weight bearing exercises are considered good so walking, running, skipping – anything that would produce some weight on your joints,# she says.#It doesn’t have to be high intensity exercises.#We can also take supplements such as Vitamin B and Vitamin D. Living a healthy lestyle, reducing how much alcohol we drink and stopping smoking will also help.There#s also several natural remedies sold in health shops and on the internet such as red clover extract and black cohosh.They#re said to be effective because they contact plant-based compounds that mimic the action of the oestrogen hormone.But Dr Kamran warns we don#t know about the concentration of many of these products sold on the internet and they can react with other medications.#People with no other medical products can use these productsthey think that it helps them butthey use other medications it’s best to get advice from their doctor,# she said.#There are lots of things available on the internet but we do not knowthey improve the situation but they can cause harmunregulated amounts are used.#World Menopause Day is held every year to raise awareness of menopause and the support options available.If you#re looking for more information about menopause and the help you can receive visit the Menopause Matters website or The British Menopause Society.Here#s how you can be happy without chasing big achievements in your lePetition launched to get new hospital in Shetland Warning over infant virus doctors deem more concerning than Covid Man who hit #rock bottom# turns le around with boxingFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63138677-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63138677-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63138677-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.63138677-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"take away takeover of empty supermarket in inverurie town centre","story":"Inverurie fast food fans will soon have another menu to browse after plans to convert an abandoned town centre supermarket were approved.

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise.

lead at half time.Star looked to put the game to bed as quickly as possible in the second half and did so as Aaron Moore grabbed his second of the afternoon following a slip from the Duncanrig keeper.MacLean was next to double his tally as he proved too sharp for the Duncanrig defence and finished well from a tight angle to make the score - with half an hour to go.This gave manager Weir the chance to ring the changes, with Ryan Caskie coming on to replace Aaron Moore and helping himself to two goals of his own from close range to make the final score -.The only sour note was an injury to goal-scoring substitute Caskie which will rule him out of Star#s next game.Star look to make it back-to-back wins on Saturday October , again on their travels to Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"art and smarten up for tarbert thrift shop","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThanks to a shop front improvement grant from Argyll and Bute Council, the Tarbert Church of Scotland was able to spruce up its charity shop in the village.The  per cent grant helped towards the cost of painting and erecting new signs at the thrt shop with a specially-commissioned painting of Tarbert with the prominent church and a Church of Scotland emblem.The painting is the remarkable work of talented Tarbert artist Matthew Manao, who studied fine art at Glasgow School of Art, and it makes the perfect connection between the thrt shop to the church.The thrt shop provides a major part of the income for the church and has been a leline to keeping the church going for many years.It has helped provide funds for disabled access to the church through the sale of merchandise with images gted to the church by prominent Mid Argyll artist Jolomo, the late John Leckie and Molly Smith, supported by monetary donations and by the sale of #virtual# bricks.Lisa MacFarlane of Tarbert church said: #We are grateful for the support of the community and the many visitors to Tarbert.#Feel free to join the Church of Scotland in Tarbert, Kilberry and Skipness Facebook page for updates on the church and thrt shop.#The shop front improvement grant utilises Scottish Government Town Centre Funding  with the aim of supporting the local economy by providing employment for tradespeople while helping towns become more attractive places to live, work, visit and invest."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures october 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLike a scene from the heyday of Para Handy and the Clyde puffers, the VIC makes her sedate way from Crinan towards Bellanoch Bridge.Lochgilphead reader Rhona Young kindly sent us her photograph, taken on Saturday October  as the Vic was travelling on the Crinan Canal en route to Cairnbaan."},{"url":null,"title":"huge-day-cross-country-running-borders","story":"THE SCOTTISH Athletics East District Cross Country relays took place in Galashiels on Saturday.Lasswade AC took the senior womenrsquos gold medals thanks to the trio of Amy Smith, Sarah Tait and Amy Frankland.Taitrsquos second leg run was influential in Lasswadersquos win and her time of : over a hilly course at Gala Academy was enough to take the fastest lap title by two seconds from Holly Page .Edinburgh Uni Hare and Hounds took the silver and bronze medals in that race with the surprise being that it was their lsquoCrsquo team who were second with the lsquoArsquo team in third.Just for good measure, the students from Edinburgh were also fourth and fth in an impressive collective performance for the Hare and Hounds.Central won the menrsquos race thanks to the efforts of Calum Phillip, Ben Macmillan, Luca Fonottoli and Hamish Hickey.Edinburgh Uni were second here, too, with Aberdeen AAC coming home third for the bronzes.

We are exceptionally grateful for their continued support and determined to repay that commitment on the pitch whist working closely with them in the wider Borders community.ldquoDuring lockdown we were able to continue to offer rugby activities for the younger children, and during April we were able to support a new Try It Out campaign aimed at children that wouldnrsquot typically have access to rugby or sporting activities because of social or economic barriers. We feel very strongly that the ability to pay shouldnrsquot prevent access to sport.ldquoParents and carers were offered the option to pay what they could, or in some cases nothing at all. Over  boys and girls joined in the fun sessions at the Melrose pitches, and the majority registered to stay on until the end of the summer season. The lting of restrictions has allowed the Southern Knights to launch their buddy scheme aligning some of their semi-professional players to the younger players to help encourage and develop their skills and to inspire children to play to the best of their ability.ldquoThis inclusive ethos is shared by CGI and the award winning Inspire Learning Programme developed in partnership with Scottish Borders Council for pupils from primary four to sixth year in high school throughout the area.ldquoThis uses iPads and an array of other tools to support learning and aims to benefit all children and teachers by raising attainment, support equity and inclusion, and to work towards preparing young people for a digital future. We are keen to continue to support these initiatives in conjunction with CGI over the coming months and years.Dominic Taddei, Chair of Southern Knights Super Board said: ldquoWe are delighted to continue to work a further term with our headline sponsor CGI. Their support through very dficult times has been phenomenal and we look forward to working with them as we get ready to approach the finals day, and to now have the ability to offer a wider audience for FOSROC Super with the fantastic news that was released by Scottish Rugby on rd June  that every Super Sunday fixture has been televised live on free-to-air television by new broadcast partner, FreeSports. The FOSROC Super finals weekend will take place on the weekend of    October, and we look forward to showcasing CGI as our headline sponsor at the finals event.The continuing partnership between CGI and the Southern Knights is not only a relationship supporting sport in the Scottish Borders but also Southern Knights players and coaches are working closely with CGI on community-based initiatives in Borders schools, delivering motivational and inspirational videos for the pupils.

forest, of course, but a very small strip of ancient woodland, east of Innerwick, that clings to the steep slopes of the glen by Crowhill. The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"home-bargains-open-haddington-retail-park-weekend-55-new-jobs","story":"The national chain is the latest retailer to open in Haddington Retail Park, with the new shop officially opening its doors for the first time on Saturday at am.Already, Costa Coffee, The Food Warehouse and Aldi are welcoming customers on the townrsquos western edge.Ahead of the opening, Home Bargains also confirmed it would be making a pound, donation to Haddington-based good cause the Lammermuir Larder.Magdalena Cosgrove, the new Home Bargains store manager at Haddington Retail Park, was looking forward to welcoming customers this weekend.She said: ldquoIrsquove worked in the retail sector for many years, but therersquos nothing quite like the buzz of opening a new store.ldquoFour years ago, I helped launch our Craigmillar Shopping Centre site, so I know how much hard work and dedication goes into something like this.ldquoI canrsquot wait to open the store this weekend alongside such a fantastic team ndash itrsquos something that Irsquom exceptionally proud of.The more than ,-square-foot store will offer shoppers a range of products, including homewares, health and beauty essentials, sweets, snacks and drinks, as well as fresh and frozen food.Pat Lemmon, founder of the Lammermuir Larder, welcomed the four-figure donation.The volunteer-led food initiative provides people in need with a weekrsquos shopping, fresh fruit and vegetables, and a meat voucher.Mrs Lemmon, who is also a member of the townrsquos community council, said: ldquoWe are over the moon to be picked as the local group to benefit from this wonderful donation from Home Bargains.ldquoThis money will go a long way in helping many people in the Haddington and Lammermuir area who are currently struggling financially and worried about putting food on the table.A petrol station is also planned for the retail park, with one remaining unit yet to be filled."},{"url":null,"title":"gas-works-see-road-closures-prestonpans-13-weeks","story":"SGN announced that it would begin work to upgrade its gas network in the Prestonpans area on Monday.The work involves replacing ,m of old metal gas mains and service pipes with new plastic pipe, ensuring a continued safe and reliable gas supply to the local community.SGN has planned its work in close consultation with local authorities to reduce disruption as much as possible.The project will be carried out by SGN contractor George Ritchie  Son.During the works, parking restrictions will be in operation allowing safe access to the pipe ndash some road closures will also be required.Temporary traffic signals will be in operation at certain times, which may cause delays during peak periods.Emergency vehicle access will be maintained throughout the work.The gas work will be suspended during the Christmas holidays, with operatives ing early in the new year.Road closures include Prestongrange Terracersquos junction with Prestongrange Road, and Polwarth Terracersquos junction with Gardiner Terrace.To minimise disruption, SGN work will be carried out on a phased basis and not all streets will be affected at the same time.Access to driveways and garages will be maintained unless previously agreed with the occupier.An SGN spokesperson said: ldquoWersquoll be working as quickly as possible to complete our work and will be making every effort to minimise inconvenience to the local community.Suspension of parking is as follows:Prestonpans Community Council is calling for greater clarity on road works in and around the town, ideally in the form of an interactive map showing all the restrictions over time.A spokesperson for the community council said: ldquoInidual roadworks are obviously necessary for the maintenance of our public utilities.ldquoHowever, there is a balance to be struck between maintenance and what can quickly become a public nuisance.ldquoIf roadworks are all planned to minimise distribution, there is currently no way of telling.

Backed to date with poundm of financing from Capita Group founder Sir Rod Aldridge, Scottish business veteran Nick Kuenssberg and several other private investors, Frog Systems aims to provide a ldquoholistic overview of peoplersquos day-to-day challenges in an easily accessible video-driven format.ldquoWe recognise that the majority of solutions that are out there ndash be they applications that you download on to your phone, or the sort of health care-type provisions provided by employers ndash are very much focused on the end game, Mr Worms said. ldquoThey are aimed at people that are suffering from stress, or depression, or anxiety, or any number of health-related issues.ldquoWe are trying to provide a service which steps back four places to say we understand as human beings that our general wellness is affected by many things ndash the environment, our economic resilience, whether we have got jobs, whether we can pay our bills ndash all of these types of issues.:Kuenssberg company Frog Systemsraises more than pound,ldquoSo our product is very much aimed athelliprecognising that we are not alone, that there is help and there is support available to us, and thatwe were to act now, then hopefully we wonrsquot find ourselves in the position of requiring medical treatment, or having to turn to alcohol or drugs or anything  to ease the pain of things we are suffering from which in many, many cases can be treated.Employing  people, Frog Systems designs each  to meet the specic needs of clients from the corporate, education, sporting and housing sectors, as well as membership organisations. The service is free to access for end-users, who are presented with short video clips of real people talking about the challenges they have faced, and how they overcame them.Within the same frame, users are also directed to local organisations providing support in their area of concern, be that addiction, depression, financial advice, access to skills training, or gender and ersity issues.The company currently has  clients, the latest being Leicesterrsquos four professional sports clubs ndash Leicester City FC, Leicester Tigers, Leicestershire County Cricket Club and Leicester Riders ndash who launched their UnitedLeicester hub last week to mark World Mental Health Day.

Not to do so is to exclude iniduals who represent no more risk to the health of others than the vaccinated majority. Surely such discrimination is not acceptable in a liberal democracy The aim of the legislation should be to protect the health of those who are vulnerable and not to coerce uptake of the vaccine among the young. If this is deemed desirable the Government should be striving to achieve this through discussion, persuasion and the provision of information.Improving the scheme in this way will not assist in alleviating the problems faced by businesses and venues in having to police the passports, but it does have the advantage of paying just a little more respect to notions of fairness and freedom.W Coghlan, Neilston.SALMON INDUSTRY IN CHOPPY WATERSTAVISH Scott, CEO of the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, begins his articlewith ldquoImagine getting a rigid-inflatable boat to work, skimming across the waves on the Sound of Mull, early morning sunlight glittering on the waves, porpoises playing in the bow wave. It made me wonderhe is looking for a career move into the Scottish Tourist Board.A more realistic intro might be: ldquoImagine enduring a choppy ride in a heavy swell on your way to spending a wet and windy day transferring dead and dying diseased salmon into a boat thatrsquos going to take them away to be buried on a nearby beach or transported a further  miles by road to a toxic waste disposal facility.Mr Scott extended his poetic licence to say ldquothe pay is pretty good with average salaries of pound,. One major company is currently looking for employees whose duties will include ldquosea lice identication and reporting. Sampling, weighing and grading of fish. Disease and parasite control. Site maintenance including net changing etc. Boat handling and stock movements. That is responsible, heavy duty work, often in dangerous conditions. The wage starts at pound. an hour, thatrsquos one penny an hour more than the real living wage and, for a -hour week, just over half that quoted by Mr Scott.He asks government to help salmon farmers by allowing them to resume bringing in workers from Eastern Europe and by building houses for those workers to live in. The first step the Scottish Government should take is to stop the expansion of the unsustainable, cruel and polluting industry of factory fish farming. Tens of millions of fish die from disease, parasite infestation and poor handling annually.It would also make sense to insist that when industries want to establish in rural areas they provide the housing and other infrastructure required by their staff and families. Too often all they do is take the money outand leave their rubbish behind.John F. Robins, For Animal Concern, Dumbarton.FOLLY OF FLATS MINDSETIN RELATION to COP , due to be hosted by Glasgow next month, the climate crisis and reducing our carbon footprint, I would like to point out an important point: many new-build flats are built without facilities outside or inside to dry laundry.Builders expect residents to use tumble dryers. These dryers use large amounts of energy, therefore they are going to cost larger amounts of money as prices rise. I spoke to someone who lives in one of these buildings, who told me that rules state that residents \"are not permitted to dry washing outside\".No wonder Extinction Rebellion activists are protesting in the way they are, in the face of such unbelievable stupidity. The idea behind it is, I suspect, that washing lines outside make the area look common. Pure snobbishness. Sort it out or Extinction Rebellion will have something to say about it.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.STILL IN DARK ABOUT OUR CULTUREI havenrsquot encountered any young person who knows that William Dunbarwas a far greater poet than Burns ndash who certainly deserves more credit than Jeremy Paxton recently gave him, for his ingenious versication.

Now almost nobody maintains that Scotland should be an independent country. Even although many still talk about independence it is far from clear what is meant by that usage and there is more or less unanimity that Scotland should be in a union, whether it be the UK or the EU. The word independence now appears to be more of a signal of rejection of the UK rather than of union in principle. Any debate that explores the concept of independence in the true meaning of the word is therefore irrelevant to the mainstream of current concern and unlikely to lead us out of the present political quagmire.The central question now therefore seems to ask which union would be best suited to the future, primarily of Scotland but also, as Scotland is traditionally an outward-looking nation, to the wider context of the common good. Rather than grieve the demise of the independence debate I am looking to explore the indicators as to what the future may hold in each of the unions respectively: what would be the respective prospects for peace, prosperity, internal dissension and hostilities, climate control, currency control, geopolitical and border dispute, education and cultural exchange, immigration management, civil and military use of nuclear power, public health, inidual liberty and public order and national autonomy within each union and so on.These are complex issues and many people prefer to focus on one word, Yes or No, which is akin to walking blindfold into the future and not representative of Scottish intellect.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.DOUBLE STANDARDS ON BORDERSTHE Westminster Conservative Government, wearing its Brexiter hat, assures us that there is no need for a border across Ireland to facilitate trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic. When it switches to wearing its unionist hat it insists that border checks and delays will be unavoidable between England and an independent Scotland which rejoins the EU.Perhaps our man in Marbella will explain these contradictory positions upon his .Willie Maclean, Milngavie.PLEASE RECONSIDER FREEPORT SNUBCOULD I appeal to Nicola Sturgeon to reconsider her decision to not progress with the UK freeport model As a north-east businessman, and provider of employment opportunities for local people, I find this decision very hard to understand in the present economic climate.Instead of collaboration for the benefit of all, we have the same old response of refusing to cooperate for the desires of a few.Putting politics, and ambition for independence, over and above the well-being of our economy and employment benefits of the people seems to be the hallmark of our present Government.When will this change Graham Whitbourn, Balmedie.DANGER OF CONTROL OF CARE SERVICEMANY independence supporters working in local authorities have had their commitment undermined by the contradictory demands from the Scottish Government for both maximum devolution within the UK and maximum centralisation within Scotland.I believe in devolution as a principle. So when we could see that Westminster was staging a power grab after Brexit I was appalled. But when I saw the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to nakedly grab power by taking all social work and social care services into the control of a huge national quango to be called the National Care Service I was even more alarmed.It would seem that in spite of the examples of how big, centrally-managed quangos do not work , the Scottish Government is set on wresting control and power not just from Westminster, but also from Scottish local authorities and local communities.It is hard to defend the Scottish Government from allegations of hypocrisy and snatching control for its own sake when it carries on like this.Such concentration of power at the centre of any country in a command and control structure is both dangerous and undemocratic and not the vision of a free Scotland so many of us hoped to see in our letimes.K Heath, Kirriemuir.REAL CONCERNS ON ASSISTED DYINGTHERE is abroad again the contentious issue of a campaign to legalise assisted dying.It is so hard for relatives to watch a loved one suffering extreme pain which even palliative medication cannot ease. One has to have sympathy for those suffering and those watching them suffering, but there is the concern that to open the door to assisted dying legally may amount to creating the conditions where assisted dying becomes a norm in much the same way that abortion is taken today as an everyday occurrence.Safeguards were supposed to have been put in place to ensure that abortion did not just become abortion on demand, which is, however, the way it looks today.The cavalier suggestion about taking a decision via a Zoom consultation with the terminally ill patientdoes not smack of a sufficient safeguard to protect the interests of that particular patient.Then there is the question of who will administer the prescribed final injection or give the last tablet or draught to help the patient pass over peacefully. If any such decision has to be made, it is vital that the doctor should be present, alone with the patient physically, to determine the patients state of mind and the path the patient wishes to take with regard to assisted dying.If the patient is determined to go ahead with ending le, then there has to be consideration as to who will administer the final draught, since there are bound to be feelings of guilt to contend with for the person or persons executing the ending of anothers le.Christianity has taught us that le is sacred and we should interfere with neither the introduction nor the ending of le.For many of faith, and not just the Christian faith, assisted dying would be a step in the wrong direction in that they would feel it opens the floodgates to what would amount to a culture of expected or enforced death for anyone struck down with any terminal condition for which medical science has not yet found a cure.To me, there is no need to strive officiously to keep alive any patient for whom there is no cure but neither is there any good reason for hastening someones end when medical science can come up with effective palliative treatments to ease the afflictions of patients in distress.I know that I could not in all conscience agree to the administration of a fatal dose nor administer such a dose to anyone trapped by a terminal condition. If the powers that be sign such a law into force, there will have to be real and genuine safeguards built into the law without any possibility of evasion of those safeguards, as sadly has happened down through the years with abortion.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.ABORTION IS NOT HEALTHCAREIF only there were more MSPs like John Mason willing to take a stand against abortion and attend pro-le vigils . I consider that the brutal and horric act of abortion is the greatest crime against humanity in our so-called enlightened and progressive age and more politicians should take a stand like Mr Mason. We say it is good to be anti-slavery good to be anti-racism and good to be anti-trafficking. I would add that it is also good to be anti-abortion.The Back off Scotland campaign continues to push the  narrative that pro-le vigils harass and intimidate vulnerable women. However, FOI requests to Police Scotland and ious NHS boards have shown that there has never been one single case of harassment or intimidation reported. Back Off Scotland has also never produced any evidence of its claims.In reality, abortion is not healthcare. It doesnt make a baby healthier and it doesnt make a woman healthier. It just kills. Our society should offer compassion, love, and advocacy to women and their unborn children ndash not encourage abortion.Martin Conroy, Cockburnspath, Berwickshire."},{"url":null,"title":"succession-series-three-episode-one","story":"For its many admirers the place belongs to Succession, Jesse Armstrongrsquos viciously funny drama about a warring family that is certainly nothing to do with the Murdochs, or the Trumps, or any other dynasty with very expensive lawyers on speed dial, honest guv.Yet Succession has only two series to its name, compared to six for David Chasersquos sublime New Jersey mob opera, and five for David Simonrsquos Dickens in modern day Baltimore masterpiece.Is it not presumptuous to award a spot this early to something that is essentially just another reworking of King Lear with knobs on How long can Logan keep dangling the same carrot of the CEO job in front of his warring brats before the story gets old There is a lot riding, then, on the third series, which finally begins tonight on Sky Atlantic after months of Covid delays.Series two endedwith Kendall Roy , son and rightful heirto media mogul Logan Roy , standing up to dad.Chosen by Logan to be the fall guy for a #MeToo scandal, Kendall turned the tables at a press conference and put daddy dearest in the dock instead.The new series opens the same day with the choosing of sides by Loganrsquos aptly named daughter Shiv , son Roman , Gerri, the apple of Romanrsquos eye , cousin Greg , who is either a complete idiot, or the one who could beat them all to the prize of taking over Waystar Royco, and ious other lieutenants whipping boys.The action shuttles from regional airports to Manhattan as the family fight over who can buy the best attack dogs in law and PR.Writer and creator Armstrong cut his teeth on The Thick of It.

Itrsquos gladiators v gladiators out there, not lions v Christians.Just as in The Thick of It, the cast are so comfortable with each other, and the writing so slick, the drama moves like a well-oiled farce.The actors donrsquot need to fight over the juiciest lines because there are enough for everybody. Where other comedy-dramas might have a miserly handful of zingers, the multiple Emmy-winning Succession throws them around like confetti.In an ensemble as good as this, it should be dficult to choose a favourite, but who are we ******* kidding here  Brian Coxrsquos swearmaster-in-chief commands every scene he is in.Logan, one of the most fascinating TV characters in years, is a charming psychopath who long ago wearied of the charming part of the deal.He is, as cousin Greg likes to say, ldquoall killer, no filler, a man who has clawed his way out of poverty in Scotland , a modern day robber baron who thinks tough love is the only kind that will equip his children to survive in this rotten world .Courtesy of Cox, Logan can make Daniel Day-Lewisrsquos oilman in There Will Be Blood look like Santa.The third series opener could have been a stop-start affair aiming to pick up new viewers who have heard the buzz about Succession and fancy seeing what the fuss is about.That Armstrong gives it the pace of a runaway train is a promising sign that he is not short of ideas about where to take the story and is in a hurry to get there.

after the fault was repaired but caused disruption to schooling and commuters.Loch Riddon which should have been replaced by  itself broke down with engine gearbox issues in July leaving CalMac scrambling to find a replacement ferry.It comes after a summer of breakdowns and disruption in the CalMac network.Meanwhile, would-be ferry replacements MV Glen Sannox and Hull  are still languishing in now state-owned Ferguson Marines shipyard, with costs of their construction more than doubling from the original poundm

billionairersquos company Ineos is to invest more than eurobn into electrolysis projects to make zero-carbon green hydrogen across Europe in a move that could have a major effect on the motoring industry.The company is is hoping to lsquotransformrsquo zero carbon hydrogen production with what will be Europersquos largest ever investment i electrolysis projects.The first plants will be built in Norway, Germany and Belgium in the next  years.It comes after Ineos brokered a landmark deal with Hyundai last year.Ineos said that it also intends to invest in France and the UK, where the hydrogen business will be headquartered, but did not give details.The chemicals giant and the South-Korean car maker signed a memorandum of understanding that will \"explore new opportunities\", including hydrogen fuel cell technology being applied to the new Land Rover Defender-rivalling times.Sir Jim Ratclfe, chairman of Ineos and one of Britains richest men says Europe is currently \"crying out\" for more investment in green hydrogen.He said: \"Green hydrogen represents one of our best chances to create a more sustainable and low carbon world.ldquoEurope is crying out for more investment in green hydrogen and Ineosrsquo announcement today shows our determination to play a leading role in this important new fuel.The Ineos hydrogen business will have its headquarters in the UK and aims to build capacity to produce hydrogen across its network of sites in Europe, in addition to partner sites where hydrogen can accelerate decarbonisation of energy.The move comes less than a year after Ineos abandoned plans to build a state-of-the-art car plant in Wales, announcing that it would build its new x Grenadier cars at a former Mercedes-Benz factory in France instead.It had previously pledged to build the Grenadier in Bridgend, Wales, creating up to  jobs.In January, Mr Ratclfe snubbed politicians investigating transforming Grangemouth into a carbon neutral hub.The Scottish Government had set up the Grangemouth Future Industry Board which will ldquoensure the signicant opportunities for low carbon economic growth are maximised and attempt to ldquounlock potential investment and identy policy levels that can support sustainable growth.The Scottish Government said at the time that the board was at an ldquoearly stage of development and would have ldquodecarbonisation woven through all aspects of its work.Ministers also committed pound million to support the industrial and manufacturing sectorsrsquo transition to net zero.The strategy for Grangemouth and wider heavy industry points to carbon capture and storage being scaled up ndash with ministers considering using ldquoScotlandrsquos vast storage potential to import ldquoCO via ship from European carbon capture projects, which officials hope could lead to ldquoopening up the potential for a CO transportation economy.Despite calls from campaigners to speed up decarbonisation, Ineos has warned thatits operation is halted or scaled back quickly, its products ldquowill be manufactured where and transported back to Scotland, adding signicantly to the global emissions.The Ineos plant at Grangemouth has an annual turnover of pound. billion and supports around  direct jobs and around , indirect employees. Around  per cent of Scotlandrsquos GDP flows through Grangemouth Port."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmUnfortunately, weather-related delays has meant that phase two of the resurfacing works on Ayre Mills roundabout only got underway this morning.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4156276.jpg--.jpg?1634197334000\n","title":"st vincent de paul member roadshow visits ballymena","story":"THE Society of St Vincent de Paul has hosted a series of Member Roadshows, visiting towns and cities across the province, to engage with members in person for the first time since March last year.As well as providing representatives of more than , members from  SVP Conferences across Northern Ireland with an overview of the Society and how it has responded to the tens of thousands who have needed its support most in the past  months. Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

The Department of Education purchased the site and building.However, to allow pupils to attain the academic, athletic and artistic standards it has set, the local college invested in additional facilities including sports pitches with floodlighting for winter and evenings, changing facilities, a large assembly hall to host concerts, widened corridors for ease of movement and extra classrooms.These enhanced facilities came at a cost of £.million.Around £m of that cost was covered by a fundraiser while the school awaited the final figures for the sale of its former campuses.The department sold the original lands for £.m.According to Foyle College, the department retained £.m of that for grants it previously awarded to the old school sites.That meant £, was available to the school, leaving a deficit of £k, which has since been reduced to £k.In correspondence with alumni and friends of the school, the college said the department’s figures were based on “clawing back” money that has been spent on a school prior to its new build.It read: “Because the school has received grants from DE over the past  years to fund capital items at Springtown and Duncreggan, legislation provides that DE claw back a proportion of these grants against any sale proceeds from land owned by the school.”Foyle College has been contacted for comment..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMore On Department of EducationStudent teachers trained in lesaving skills in bid to improve NI cardiac survival rates PremiumNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusNI schools urged to address shortage in digital workforce PremiumBlack and Irish Traveller pupils among highest number eligible for free school meals in NI, new figures showMinister urged to support young people who missed out on education due to Covid with new ‘catch-up’ policyMost ReadCocaine kingpin Noel Johnston plunged to death during police raid on Ballymena flatNorth Belfast woman still holds UK’s youngest gran titleJohn LavertyOpinionDrug dealer Noel Johnston was the hardest of hard men in a dangerous town... and he was only a teenager at the timeFamily left devastated after electrician Adam Newell killed following work-related accidentWatch: Glentoran goalkeeper Aaron McCarey sent off for ‘moment of madness’ clash with team-mate Bobby BurnsTop VideosPlayFuneral held for Chieftains founder Paddy MoloneyPlayKatrina Rainey Knockloughrim killing: Mancharged with murder of womanPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest Northern IrelandNew £m cancer unit opens at hospitalNI petrol station halts unleaded sales after ‘contamination’ reportsMurder of Sir David Amess an ‘attack on democracy’ – Lord DoddsBrexit: Brussels hints talks won’t include stripping EU judges from NI ProtocolDennis Hutchings: Trial adjourned for three weeks after former soldier contracts Covid-LatestFamily of Sir David Amess view flowers and tributes left for Tory MPDavid Moyes believes clean sheets are key to success for West HamMother who lost four-year-old son to brain tumour campaigns for research fundingColin Powell, general who became US secretary of state, dies with Covid-£m average house price gap between England’s most and least expensive towns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Columba is a figure as multi-faceted as his names are numerous, be it Columba, Colmcille or Columb. googletag.cmd.push This year marks the ,th anniversary of the birth of one of the patron saints of the island. Columba, who was a prolic founder of monasteries, is credited with founding the city of Derry upon the rocks that mark where Long Tower Church stands today. However, Columba was not merely a meek monastery founder but someone who exhibited the courage of his convictions in stories as wide ranging as confronting Pictish tribes in modern-day Scotland to immersing himself in transcription and the reproduction of manuscripts. With Columba as its patron, St. Columb’s College will stage a year of celebration in honour of the momentous anniversary of Columba’s birth.     A Mass, celebrated by Bishop McKeown, on June  this year marked the start of this year of celebration that will culminate on June  next year.. The celebrations will entail the celebrating of Columba in his totality from Columba the scholar to Columba the seafarer to Columba the warrior, to name but a few. St. Columb’s College is inviting members of the public to its inaugural event on Friday, October  next at :pm in St. Eugene’s Cathedral Church Hall, Infirmary Road.  Dr Stephen Kelly.  Nathan Thiruvengadam, from the Colleges Columba Committee, said: “We are delighted to announce that Dr Stephen Kelly, past pupil and recipient of the Queen’s University Student Union Award for most iInspir- ing motivating teacher in both  and in , will be delivering a talk titled: Calves and Kindles: St Columba and the History of the Book. “Dr. Kelly, who is the author of the upcoming Imagining History in Medieval Britain, as well as co-editor of Betwixt and Between: Place and Cultural Translationand Imagining the Book , will walk us through the questions: Can it be true that St. Columba left Ireland over a book  Why was the act of copying St Finnian’s Psalter such an affront  What was a Psalter anyway, and how did it come to represent such a powerful instrument of cultural prestige and political authority  The talk will situate the Cathach of St Columba within the context of late classical and medieval ‘book culture.’ It will argue that the book is the most signicant technological innovation in Western culture, while also suggesting that the book and its metaphors continue, even in a digital age, to shape profoundly our under- standing of memory, history – and ourselves.” “The event is open to all be you young or old an expert or a novice on the background of our city’s founder- all are welcome. “The event is free but email columba@ stcolumbscollege.org to con- firm your attendance. “Tea and refreshments will be provided after the talk.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

We urge everyone who understands the threat posed by climate change to join protests because it is only through the mass mobilisation that we can build the kind of pressure needed for urgent, radical and systemic action to address the climate crisis.’ At September’s full meeting, Derry and Strabane Council backed People Before Profit Councillor Maeve O’Neills motion calling for support for the th of November Global Day of Actionin Derry and across these islands.     Cllr ONeill said, ‘The decisions made at COP will shape how governments respond, or not, to the climate crisis. Westminster, the Stormont Executive and the Daacuteil governments have failed to take the urgent and radical action needed. People power is the key to forcing decision makers away fromGovernment’sdo-nothing systemicapproach,focusing only on inidual actions. Thesystemicchange needed to avert catastrophic climate change actually has the potential to improve the quality of le for the vast majority of people on the planet.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Sky Blues slumped to a second consecutive defeat at the hands of Newry City – despite having taken the lead. Benny McLaughlin gave Stute an early lead at the Brandywell but an equaliser from Stephen Lawless and James Teelans strike on the hour gave Newry the points. googletag.cmd.push While Donaghey could not fault his troops for work-rate, a lack of quality has caused enough concern for him to seek new blood to bolster his squad. He said: “Without revealing too much, Ive ten players in mind who Id like to bring to the team. “It would be great to get all of them but it could very well work out that I go for ten and end up being able to bring in three on that list. “We will have to see. By Christmas, that list could potentially rise to twenty but, I will be trying to get new faces in to add to our numbers.     “Ive not yet entered into any talks with most of them as they are still under contract at their own clubs. Those who are at amateur level I have had a chat with. Again we will have to wait and see. “With the squad that I have right now, the work-rate is there but we are just missing that bit of quality that can convert that work-rate into points and get us higher up the league. “We not only need to create more chances but we have to take them too. A good side like Newry showed that last week. “Im also looking to see where the leaders in our squad are and for them to step up. It doesnt help when you have injuries to key players but you still have to show some leadership out there. “Newry are the best team weve played so far but some of our players need to grow up very quickly. “I knew what I was getting into when I arrived here but it seems we do need to strengthen the squad which is what Ill be trying to do.” Institute currently lie third from bottom in the NIFL Championship and face a tricky-trip to promotion-chasing Ballyclare Comrades on Saturday. Comrades flexed their muscles ahead of Institutes visit with a - win at fourth in the table, Annagh United. Donaghey added: “Ballyclare are a very progressive club with lots of experience in their squad. “However,we can step up and add the quality needed to go with our work-rate, we can hopefully get something.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Sky Blues slumped to a second consecutive defeat at the hands of Newry City – despite having taken the lead. Benny McLaughlin gave Stute an early lead at the Brandywell but an equaliser from Stephen Lawless and James Teelans strike on the hour gave Newry the points. googletag.cmd.push While Donaghey could not fault his troops for work-rate, a lack of quality has caused enough concern for him to seek new blood to bolster his squad. He said: “Without revealing too much, Ive ten players in mind who Id like to bring to the team. “It would be great to get all of them but it could very well work out that I go for ten and end up being able to bring in three on that list. “We will have to see. By Christmas, that list could potentially rise to twenty but, I will be trying to get new faces in to add to our numbers.     “Ive not yet entered into any talks with most of them as they are still under contract at their own clubs. Those who are at amateur level I have had a chat with. Again we will have to wait and see. “With the squad that I have right now, the work-rate is there but we are just missing that bit of quality that can convert that work-rate into points and get us higher up the league. “We not only need to create more chances but we have to take them too. A good side like Newry showed that last week. “Im also looking to see where the leaders in our squad are and for them to step up. It doesnt help when you have injuries to key players but you still have to show some leadership out there. “Newry are the best team weve played so far but some of our players need to grow up very quickly. “I knew what I was getting into when I arrived here but it seems we do need to strengthen the squad which is what Ill be trying to do.” Institute currently lie third from bottom in the NIFL Championship and face a tricky-trip to promotion-chasing Ballyclare Comrades on Saturday. Comrades flexed their muscles ahead of Institutes visit with a - win at fourth in the table, Annagh United. Donaghey added: “Ballyclare are a very progressive club with lots of experience in their squad. “However,we can step up and add the quality needed to go with our work-rate, we can hopefully get something.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Tel     Facebook Talking To Our Babies   www.shantallow.net  I was chatting with my niece and talking about last weeks article which was all about congratulations and the great things about being pregnant. googletag.cmd.push She said it made her smile and laugh but also that throughout her pregnancy she went from total joy to worry, worries about everything, all in the space of one day or even over a few minutes! So this week I thought I’d write a little bit about some of the worries you may have, to try to help you worry less… Worry one I think the main one is to stop worrying, it isn’t good for you, isn’t good for baby! Try to find a solution to that worry, find a way to ‘solve it’ and then ‘stop’ - think I’ve dealt with that so it’s a worry no more!     Worry two Baby development, of course you’ll be thinking every day how’s my baby growing, is she or he okay. The best advice here is go for your scans, look at your scan photo for reassurance, have extra scansthey make you feel reassured, talk to your midwe and follow her advice about diet, exercise, sleep etc AND relax! Worry three Giving birth - well baby is going to come out regardless of whether you worry so stop! You can though, plan what type of birth you would like, what pain relief you would like, what music you would like to listen to etc. But do also remember that he or she may decide to come early, that you can change your mind about pain relief and that as long as she or he arrives safely and you are both well that’s all that matters. Worry four Home or hospital - my niece wanted a water birth at home, till we found out about all the fuss with hose pipes, tap attachments, emptying the pool etc etc - so think carefully about what is best for you, your home, and your purse  Think, decide, be willing to change your mindbaby or you needs to and stop worrying, after all in the grand scheme of things as long as she or her arrives safely does it really matter! Worry five Germs, we’ve all had a really worrying year with the corona virus and it has made us all a bit overly conscious about germs. So being pregnant can amply this worry, but remember Mums have been pregnant for years, baby is protected in you and as long as your home is clean enough that’s all that matters. This means you do not have to clean everywhere every day! If you can, try to feed baby yourself at least for the first few days, evenyou express into a bottle, as this will help her immunity too. Worry six One of the biggest worries my niece had was who to have with her when it was time for baby to arrive. Of course she wanted baby’s dad there but then both their Mums, her Nan, her two Sisters and her Step Mum also wanted to be there, and all of them were asking consistently, giving so many reasons about why it should be them. I know my niece was completely stressed about this, I did feel like saying forget them just have me but of course I didn’t! I just said, just have Dad, tell everyone that this is what you want, just say no but thank you. Butthe time comes and you feel like you need one of them, for whatever reason decide then and there, not now, not today - but don’t tell them this otherwise it’s back to the me, me me, me please! Worry seven Telling your other child, don’t tell him or her too soon otherwise you will be tormented for nine months! Do explain that baby won’t be able to play - new siblings think ‘yes someone to play with’ and can be so disappointed when they realise baby can’t! Worry eight Feeding, there is a lot of pressure on new Mum’s to breast feed, but less information that says it’s okayyou can’t,it hurts too much, that you can’t because of the mediation you are taking,you aren’t producing enough milk etc. So from me, who experienced all this pressure and knows how harder it made it,you can’t don’t worry, just remember formula was designed for babies, enjoy feeding time, the snuggled up together, the closeness, after all that’s what matters the most! Worry nine The dog, the cat … of course you can’t get rid of Rover the dog, or Whiskers the cat, but you can adapt your home to help them prepare. Maybe they won’t be allowed on the couch or in the bedroom any more, maybe Rover will have to have two short walks a day instead of one long one, maybe you will buy a cat net for the pram or Moses basket, maybe you will buy a few new special toys for Rover for when you bring baby home. Just remember Rover and Whiskers will be curious, don’t leave them alone together for a while, don’t ignore them or this may cause jealousy after all before baby came did you not treat them like your baby! And remember millions of homes have babies and pets so providing you introduce them carefully and still give them lots of love there is no reason that won’t be your home either! Worry ten Worrying too much … yes you are so stop!ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Rhonda McKean, , had a bout of painful sciatica that made it dficult to walk. Using a rollator frame, she took a fall and was told by her Doctors surgery, Oakleaf Medical Practice, to make her way to Altnagelvin. googletag.cmd.push However, a nine-hour wait in pain followed that didnt even result in Mrs McKean being seen that day. As a result, she had to make ajourney where she was eventually X-rayed. She said: “Six weeks ago, I had sciatica and during the night, it became so uncomfortable that it wouldnt let me walk. “I had a rollator in the house and I thought Id use that because theres no way that I would be able to get about. “Unfortunately, I managed to fall hard on to the ground and I knew that I hurt my back. “I rang the doctors surgery and was told Id get a call back from the doctor. Instead, I get a call back from the physiotherapist.     “He told me to come overso I struggled over and he told me I needed to go to Altnagelvin Hospital for an X-ray on my hip because he thought I had fractured that. “I told him that I definitely hadnt fractured my hip but had hurt my back. The X-ray showed that I hadnt broken my hip. “I went back to the surgery and the physio went to get the doctor who came back and told me that the physio wanted me to go to Altnagelvin because he thinks youve had a stroke. “I then get to Altnagelvin where I sat in the waiting area at casualty for nine hours. “I had been sent to get a brain scan but they wouldnt do one because they said I didnt have a stroke. “But during all that time, I was in pure agony as having been sitting in AE for nine hours. My back was broke but the doctors hadnt told me as they hadnt read the report in the bone scan. “I later had an X-ray and was told I had an L lumber fracture. I then had a further MRI scan.” Unfortunately, that scan would bring bad news for Mrs McKean which was compounded by it being given not by her GP at Oakfield Medical Practice, but by the receptionist. Mrs McKean added: “Last Friday , I got a letter to go to X-ray for an ultrasound on my thyroid. “I phoned up the surgery to speak to my GP to ask why I have been requested to go for an ultrasound to my thyroid. “The girl on reception put me on hold and then came back to tell me, the MRI scan showed a growth on your thyroid. “The receptionist told me that and the doctor himself couldnt even let me know. He didnt even have the decency to phone me and tell me this was happening. Yet its left to a receptionist to tell me point-blankely because theywont let me speak to a doctor.” Regarding Mrs McKeans nine-hour wait at Altnagelvin, a spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said: “Due to patient client confidentiality we would not be responding to inidual cases. “If a patient client or their relative has any issue in relation to their treatment or the service they have received, we would encourage them to raise these issues through the Trusts comments and complaints system - the Patients Advocate Office. “The Patients Advocate Office can be contacted on . All complaints received are investigated promptly and a response issued to the person.” And in relation to how Oakfield Medical Practice broke the news to Mrs McKean of her thyroid growth diagnosis, a spokesperson for the Health and Social Care Board added: “It would not be appropriate to discuss issues in relation to inidual patients. “The patient should raise her concerns with the practice in the first instance andnot satisfied following that can approach the Health and Social Care Board through the complaints process. “If the complaint cannot be resolved through the HSC Complaints Procedure the patient can approach the NI Public Services Ombudsman.”  Defendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told  Thomas Rainey was remanded in custody until November .

The package was announced by the Executives Health Minister, Robin Swann. Mr Swann said the Department of Health has committed pound. million to support additional patient care through the winter. googletag.cmd.push A further pound. million will be spent to improve telephony infrastructure and improve accessibility, such as the use of online systems for ordering repeat prescriptions, helping to free up telephone lines and staff time. This is in addition to the pound. million already invested to upgrade GP systems to improve telephone access. Foyle MLA, Ms Ferguson, said that while the announcement from the Health Minister was to be welcomed, there was still more to be done. She said: “I welcome the announcement by the health minister of an extra pound. million to help improve people’s access to GP services. “This funding will be used to improve patient care and the telephone service offered by GP practices for people ordering prescriptions and over the phone consultations.     “People are having major dficulties getting GP appointments and it’s important that efforts are made to address this issue. “While this is an important step in supporting our under-pressure GP surgeries, much more needs to be done. “The health minister must come forward with his plan to roll out Multi-Disciplinary Teams to general practices so that pressure can be relieved on the GPs and the treatments that patients need can be provided in a timely manner.” Of the financial package that he has announced, the Health Minister Mr Swann said: “I recognise how important it is that people can access GP services when they need to do so. “I must emphasise that GP practices have been open throughout the pandemic and will continue to use both face-to-face appointments and alternative consultation options for patients as appropriate. “Feedback from GPs indicates that many patients are presenting with more complex needs, particularly those who have a chronic disease, making it more dficult for them to see all the people they would wish to.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Ms McLaughlin vacates her role as Economy Spokesperson to take up the position as as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office as well as being the SDLPs spokesperson on Covid Recovery. googletag.cmd.push The reshuffle also sees a move for East Derry MLA, Cara Hunter. She moves from the position of Mental Health Spokesperson to the role of Climate Champion. Cara will also sit on the Infrastructure Committee. Ms McLaughlins fellow Foyle MLA, Mark H Durkan, remains in his post as Communities  Culture Spokesperson. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood insisted that the shakeup of the party’s spokespeople is about holding Ministers to account and delivering better outcomes for people across the north of Ireland. He said: “The SDLP has the most energetic and effective front bench teams of any party in the Assembly. “The changes I have announced today will build on the work we have been doing over the last two years to change the lives of the people we represent.     “At a moment when others are retreating to the politics of boycott, ision and deadlock, the SDLP team is committed to breaking down barriers and delivering on the priorities of people in all of our communities. “That means managing the Covid- recovery, addressing the climate crisis and driving forward a prosperity agenda. “As part of these changes I have created new roles that reflect urgent political priorities.  “Sinead McLaughlin MLA will take on an ambitious new portfolio focussed on Covid recovery. Given the cross-cutting nature of this brief I have appointed Sinead as Chair of the Executive Office Committee where she will hold the First Ministers to account for the abject failure to produce a robust strategy to transform our society. “I have also appointed Cara Hunter MLA as the SDLP Climate Champion, reflecting the urgent need to address the crisis of global temperature increases and the impact it will have on a whole generation of people. “The consequences of inaction are severe and the SDLP is bringing tough legislative proposals at Stormont and Westminster that will address the crisis. Cara will also take on a new portfolio focussed on the ambitions and needs of a new generation of young people. “The SDLP team is full of ambitious and talented public representatives who have the energy and the ideas to transform our society. Applying their skills and experience to their new roles, I know that they’ll deliver for the people we represent.” Reacting to her new role on Twitter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “My new role starts this week as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office, where I will be holding the joint first ministers to account, leading the SDLPs work on Covid recovery and demanding that Derry is treated with the justice and equality my city deserves.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Ms McLaughlin vacates her role as Economy Spokesperson to take up the position as as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office as well as being the SDLPs spokesperson on Covid Recovery. googletag.cmd.push The reshuffle also sees a move for East Derry MLA, Cara Hunter. She moves from the position of Mental Health Spokesperson to the role of Climate Champion. Cara will also sit on the Infrastructure Committee. Ms McLaughlins fellow Foyle MLA, Mark H Durkan, remains in his post as Communities  Culture Spokesperson. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood insisted that the shakeup of the party’s spokespeople is about holding Ministers to account and delivering better outcomes for people across the north of Ireland. He said: “The SDLP has the most energetic and effective front bench teams of any party in the Assembly. “The changes I have announced today will build on the work we have been doing over the last two years to change the lives of the people we represent.     “At a moment when others are retreating to the politics of boycott, ision and deadlock, the SDLP team is committed to breaking down barriers and delivering on the priorities of people in all of our communities. “That means managing the Covid- recovery, addressing the climate crisis and driving forward a prosperity agenda. “As part of these changes I have created new roles that reflect urgent political priorities.  “Sinead McLaughlin MLA will take on an ambitious new portfolio focussed on Covid recovery. Given the cross-cutting nature of this brief I have appointed Sinead as Chair of the Executive Office Committee where she will hold the First Ministers to account for the abject failure to produce a robust strategy to transform our society. “I have also appointed Cara Hunter MLA as the SDLP Climate Champion, reflecting the urgent need to address the crisis of global temperature increases and the impact it will have on a whole generation of people. “The consequences of inaction are severe and the SDLP is bringing tough legislative proposals at Stormont and Westminster that will address the crisis. Cara will also take on a new portfolio focussed on the ambitions and needs of a new generation of young people. “The SDLP team is full of ambitious and talented public representatives who have the energy and the ideas to transform our society. Applying their skills and experience to their new roles, I know that they’ll deliver for the people we represent.” Reacting to her new role on Twitter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “My new role starts this week as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office, where I will be holding the joint first ministers to account, leading the SDLPs work on Covid recovery and demanding that Derry is treated with the justice and equality my city deserves.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening.     The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men. Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.  DERRY CITY: Nathan Gartside, Ciaran Coll, Eoin Toal, Cameron McJannett, Ronan Boyce, Danny Lafferty, Ciaron Harkin, Evan McLaughlin , Joe Thomson, Jamie McGonigle , Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe. ST.

Conor has dabbled in open mike nights over the years with great feedback however found himself struggling to find the confidence to next the next step into the world of gigging. googletag.cmd.push However, after multiple lockdowns, playing his acoustic guitar within the confines of his home, he took plunge and into the world of gigging and hasn’t looked back since. Conor’s book is open for bookings for weekday and weekend slots throughout the Northwest Like most of us, Conor’s le grinded to a halt during COVID. Not being able to do the things he loved he decided once again to wipe the dust off his old guitar and give this singing thing a go. Luckily for Conor his work from home schedule at times wasn’t overly demanding so he found himself homing in on his guitar skills between meetings.     He credits both his music and his love of the outdoors for keeping his sanity throughout the winter lockdown of . A keen swimmer, Conor found himself using the cold water, taking regular dips in Enagh Lough throughout the week to stay present and focused, alleviating the worries and uncertainty that gripped the nation during COVID times. Coming out the far side Conor sees exciting times ahead for himself. “COVID had really made me realise that the most important thing in le is to do the things that really get me excited. “Le is short and tomorrow it could be gone, so don’t take anything for granted. “I’ve discovered my love for music and live performing and this is something I really want to peruse.

Fronted by Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite, they confidently wander the border between Indie Rock and Americana — sounding like a long overdue meeting of the minds of Pinegrove, Frightened Rabbit and Julien Baker AND THEY release “Where We All End Up In The End” on October . The album will be released in its entirety on Bandcamp on  October, followed by single releases on DSPs each month thereafter. To give listeners a taste of the album, smallmint will perform a streamed album launch gig on  October and release the fourth and final single ‘Pseudonym’ on DSPs on  October. I don’t know for sure but I’m going to say that DSPs are download streaming s. Hot Press have said The layered production, melodic guitar hooks and enthralling dynamics come together to form a striking and powerful sound and they know a thing or two. The Last Mixed Tape have said A well-crafted piece of songwriting, the bands sound moves dynamically with each twist in the song’s tail”, but I don’t believe they’re the actual last mixed tape and Chorblossom have predictably said Drenched in dreamy Americana vibes, Liv is a superb second single from smallmint, I’d love to see them rip into someone meself. ‘Where we all end up in the end’ began le in , when live tracking commenced at Smalltown America Studios in Derry. Smallmint worked closely together with producer Caolaacuten Austin to achieve the sound on the record. Frontman Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite wears his emotional intricacies on his sleeve through his vocal delivery and upfront lyricism, all set to a musical backdrop of crunchy electric guitars and pounding drums. The result is a confident statement of intent — a testament to the band’s hard work, musicianship, and their own high standards. He said: “We wanted the album to feel natural and to actually sound like a band playing live in a room, which is exactly how it was recorded. It was important for us to keep that space and energy in the recordings - no need for overproduction or too many overdubs, we wanted to let the arrangement of the music by the band, and the lyrics speak for themselves.” Check them out on facebook smallmintband or instagram smallmintband or even www  smallmintbandADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them. The -year-old father of eight, whos Irelands last traditional matchmaker, said hell be using his well-honed techniques to conjure romance on Spanish soil, including bringing his -year-old “love ledger” with him to arrange dates.     The third-generation matchmaker said inquiries had already been flooding in from across the world following the release earlier this year of the Hallmark movie As Luck Would Have It, a romantic movie loosely based on the centuries-old matchmaking festival.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Derry’s Streets exhibition by Bridget Murraywill be part of a special cultural evening featuring snapshots of the region’s music, literature and art - for ing expats. googletag.cmd.push The event - sponsored by the new Derry-Donegal diaspora association, Futureproof North West, will take place at the Forum on October . The exhibition then will run at the Forum for several weeks. Ms Murray, who is still enjoying a full-time career in freelance illustration, teaching and facilitating in art, has been exhibiting for more than  years. This latest exhibition draws on a series of paintings she was commissioned to produce for the late John Bryson’s seminal history of the North West - titled Derry’s Streets: - - which will also be launched at the Forum at the October  event.

Futureproof chairperson Sean Downey said the diaspora group, which was inaugurated at Dublin’s Mansion House in , aims to support conversations that will help the region. Mr Downey explained: “We want to encourage the Northwest diaspora to connect, share ideas and experience, exchange contacts and create opportunities. “As part of this, we plan to organise activities and events to promote networking and relationship-building and strengthen the community of north westerners across the islands and further afield. “We also hope to provide support through the network to people in the North West and the diaspora across these islands and further afield seeking to develop business, promote culture and foster educational opportunities.’ Further information on the group, and the Forum event, will be available fromfutureproofnorthwest .ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast. Most of the children in that school live very close to the mast site and the consequences will be disastrousthey have to live and study under it, he said.DARRAGH CROSS ndash A Planning Service decision to refuse permission for a new filling station and shop in Darragh Cross has been strongly criticised by a local councillor.Miss Margaret Ritchie said the decision not to grant planning permission to Mr J C Flanagan for the development near the junction of the Darragh and Manse roads, showed a ldquocomplete lack of common sense.Planners gave four reasons for refusing the development which would have been the villagersquos first purpose-built shop.It was ruled that the site was in a countryside area and on a minor road and because no special circumstances were demonstrated, a relaxation of the planning controls would not be allowed.Planners also pointed out the development site is within the Belfast green belt area and is outside the development limits for Darragh Cross.DUNDRUM ndash Pupils at Sacred Heart Primary School in Dundrum are enjoying the benefits of an exciting environmental project thanks to the efforts of the Mourne Heritage Trust and the Princersquos Trust.Volunteers from both organisations were at the school recently to build a wildle pond and insect garden and also plant shrubs.Mr Gerry Carey, Princersquos Trust team leader, thanked the Mourne Heritage Trust for assisting and supervising the volunteers and for providing equipment to carry out the project.He also thanked Mr Patrick McParland, school principal, for his hospitality during the week.Mr McParland expressed his delight at the work carried out by the Princersquos Trust and also thanked the ranger and countryside team from the Mourne Heritage Trust for their help throughout the project.BALLYNAHINCH ndash A colourful ballon launch in Ballynahinch yesterday marked a vital step forward for children with speech and language dficulties.Education charity, I-CAN, officially threw open the doors of its first pioneering centre in Northern Ireland, at Ballynahinch Primary School, to provide the best start in le for children who have problems communicating.Laughter rang out from the bright classroom where three and four year-olds, who would otherwise start primary school unable to communicate, read or write, were having fun and learning together in the colourful new suite.The children who would normally feel frustrated, isolated or unconfident because they cannot communicate, are helped by a speech and language therapist, nursery teacher and classroom assistant, who work together to assess, plan and work with the children.STRANGFORD ndash Crew members on the Strangford ferry have reacted angrily to news that the Roads Service may privatise the servicersquos workforce.The government is interested in the idea of public private partnership and is studying the market to see how effective it would bethe crew was transferred to the private sector.However, the ferryrsquos employees are adamant that this would be the wrong move saying their interests would be overlooked in a private ownerrsquos quest for profit.They are also worried that there may be job losses and other cutbacks which could lead to an inadequate service for passengers.A spokesman for the crew said all employees object to the idea of privatisation adding they have all been kept in the dark about what the government is proposing to do.Around  people work on the ferry on a daily basis and he said that everyone is worried that the rights they have fought for over the years will be eroded by a private owner.Some of the staff have worked on the ferry for over  years and all are concerned that a private owner will only be interested in money and will not be able to retain the current conditionsldquoWe have all been kept in the dark about what is happening.

That was understandable in March , but needs to be addressed now.ldquoThe simple inadequacy of the emergency ambulance response times in this area is also a matter of grave concern. We recognise that a major element in that service failure is the y ambulance handover times that can occur at the hospitals with the centralised services.ldquoThat was to be dealt with under the Department of Healthrsquos ldquoNo More Silos document, published a full year ago. Why has that still not been addressed  he asked.Veteran hospital campaigner, Ann Trainor, has welcomed news in a letter from health officials that they are ldquoactively working on improving so-called point of care testingcapability at the Downe Hospital, which should signicantly increase service delivery in the urgent care centre.ldquoThis is good news, she continued. ldquoWe hope that progress on this will be very swt and perhaps the South Eastern Trust could explain why we are still waiting on an MRI scanner at the Downe too ldquoHoneyed words wonrsquot increase the diagnostic capability of our local hospital, one which has so much to offer on a regional basis too, but swt action will. The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision. That work must be done now and urgently and hand-in-hand with the creation of new medical workforce capacity.ldquoIt is time to build for the future and it is time for all the political parties to vigorously pursue this new investment for the Downe, the peoplersquos hospital. The people expect politicians to deliver and deliver now.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed that due to the pressures of Covid-, a small number of theatre lists at the Downe Hospital had to be cancelled in the past two weeks in order to provide staff support in the Intensive Care Unit at the Ulster Hospital.ldquoPatients who unfortunately had their procedures postponed have been rescheduled or have already had their procedures at another site in the South Eastern Trust area, she confirmed.The spokeswoman said a normal theatre schedule will resume as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Arts.jpg","title":"Downpatrick Arts Society event in St Patrick Centre  ","story":"LADY Margaret Ritchie joined members of Downpatrick Art Society as the grouprsquos st exhibition got underway at the St Patrickrsquos Centre.Over  paintings are on show encompassing a range of styles and themes, with many of the works inspired by local landscapes, while other paintings have stories to tell.Other paintings depict faraway shores to dream about and there are a few abstract works too ndash so therersquos something for everyone.The exhibition allows the artists to share their joy of painting with the public and indeed many of the paintings can be purchased to be enjoyed at home or as a gt for someone.The Society began over  years ago with four founding members and has continued to flourish as this yearrsquos exhibition proves.Prior to the Covid- lockdown, the Society enjoyed demonstrations and critiques by professional artists as well as outings and social activities and it is hoped toto these activities as the restrictions ease.Those who love painting or drawing and would like to join the Art Society should call    or leave their contact details at the reception desk in the St Patrickrsquos Centre.The new exhibition runs until the end of October between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Park.jpg","title":"East Down runners enjoy Castlewellan parkrun fun  ","story":"AFTER the huge efforts at the ious marathons last weekend, many runners were justiably taking their ease this weekend so it made for a quiet weekend on the racing front.Some East Down AC members saw this as a good opportunity to stay close to home by taking part in the Castlewellan parkrun.This is a free weekly K timed run and anyone can take part whether they belong to a club or not.If you want to appear in the results you must first obtain a bar code online at https:www.parkrun.org.uk register  and then turn up in good time for the .am start.There are around  dferent parkrun locations in Northern Ireland with new events being set up all the time.Castlewellan can claim to be one of the most scenic and it attracted  plus participants on Saturday past and whether the EDAC runners enjoyed their morning exercise or the post run refreshments more is up for debate.Ollie Robinson was first EDAC runner home possibly to ensure he had the pick of the goodies, while others were happy to run easy while taking in the beauty of the lake and trail.As promised there was ample coffee and homemade cake at the finish for our club runners and we were more than happy to share with other passers by.We may even have acquired the odd new member or two so all in all it was a successful day out. The idea is to visit a iety of locations in the months ahead.At the same time as some were having a leisurely lsquocupparsquo, three EDAC members had donned their red and yellow vests ready to take on the Cooley Coast K in Carlingford.Patrick Smith reported back that the weather was kind, the first eight kilometres was gentle and almost flat, but the last two gave them their moneyrsquos worth with a steady climb back to the finish line at the Cooley Kickhamrsquos GAC grounds.He managed to complete it in a time of .which put him in well inside the top half of the field of .Kelly Smith was ahead of him up the road as she stormed to a . which took a full minute off her previous best time.She was fth female overall which should really boost her confidence to no end.

Well done Kelly.Aine Grant who has settled in well to the club was doing her first K since Jimmyrsquos Ten in June and was well pleased to finish in  minutes. They all said that they would recommend this as a race to others in the club.Aaron McGrady had another good day on the hills on Saturday. He seems to flourish when there is hardship.He was out wearing his EDAC vest with pride at the Bradwell Fell Race in the centre of the Peak District.Not an easy one as it comprises eight kilometres and m of climbing with a profile of three steep climbs early in the race, a rolling circuit for a few km on the fell top and then a final steepdescent to the village.The conditions on Saturday were misty and cool on the tops but good for running and helped by a well marked course.The race set off fast into the first climb and Aaron settled back in and around tenth, hoping to work his way forward on the climbs.Over the top of the first climb, there were three main contenders with Aaron one of them.He took the lead on the way over the second climb and managed to put in a hard burst over the top and down the second descent.When he couldnrsquot hear the sound of the others breathing, he knew he had created a good gap so he relaxed a little on the third climb to gather some energy for the loop on the top.He was reasonably confident that he had built about a  second lead when he reached the final descent, but he gave it a good rattle anyway crossing the finish line with well over a minute to spare.Great pacing and a pleasing result.This weekend sees the Cross Country season taking the headlines with the NI Mastersrsquo Trials at Queenrsquos Playing Fields.Entries for this are now closed but those who are taking part will be vying for selection for the upcoming Home Countries event in November.Plenty of others will also be planning some off road training in order to prepare for the Bobby Rea XC which is the week after.It is great to see some recent recruits adding their name to the team entry and hopefully they will enjoy their first experience of lsquothe muckrsquo.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side. After  minutes they were awarded a penalty when Jack Sharvin was fouled in a clumsy challenge from Courtney inside the box.However, Sharvinrsquos spot kick was brilliantly saved by Andy Wallace.Four minutes later and Wallace produced heroics again, this time a save with his feet from Sam Carson after McComiskeyrsquos pace had again exposed Villa.The goal was coming, though, and it was goal of brilliance. Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

Concerns came not just from across the political spectrum but from groups including the Rural Community Network.”He added: “I am glad Nichola Mallon has taken this action, eventhe problem should never have arisen in the first place.”Sinn Fein MLA Cathal Boylan, meanwhile, have also welcomed the u-turn.“This was the right decision as the Minister’s plan was clearly out of step with the needs for rural communities,” he said.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

This is normally when I reach for the headphones, plug them into the laptop and search on the web for Bach or Beethoven to block out the external noise.Preacher Man belts out his hymns before handing out religious tracts to workers, shoppers, school kids and tourists who pass him by. He often starts his pitch just after a young red-haired Croatian woman finishes off her busking routine in the same street. The switch in styles and sound is eerily seamless.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIt appears almost asthe two of them have some kind of unwritten agreement as to when one of them wrap ups their set and the other takes to the street-stage.Although his repertoire is out of tune Preacher Man still has a powerful voice for someone in his late sixties or early seventies, which somehow feels connected to the strength of his religious conviction. It booms and resonates above the constant whoosh of buses and Gliders passing by in Wellington Place.While I am an atheist and secularist who believes in the separation of all churches from the state, I cannot help but admire the dedication of this lone grey haired, slightly built, eternally smiling evangelical singer pressing his leaflets non-intrusively towards a generally indferent Belfast public.There are other preachers also with a daily presence milling around the centre of the city who are,you like, more dficult “hard cases” for us non-believers. They either drive around in a car with a PA sound system mounted on its roof barking out conservative evangelical Christian messages in the same way politicians sell themselves on four wheels at election time or  they stand up in places like Cornmarket.They are also followed around the city centre by an equally determined knot of youthful LGBT activists who wave rainbow flags while staring face-off at those who preach among other things the so-called “sin” of homosexuality. Often the police are not far from the scene in case things get out of hand although in the numerous times I have witnessed these stand-offs both preachers and protestors have been entirely peaceful.Some on the left in this society believe that there should be no free speech for those labelled “hate preachers.” The Garda Siochana seem to share that view because at present three evangelical Christians are being tried in a Dundalk court for preaching against homosexuality in the Co Louth town back on September . The trio were arrested that day, handcuffed and charged with public order offences at Dundalk Garda station.Indeed, the PSNI set the bar for policing-the-preachers earlier this year by arresting other evangelicals in Larne, Enniskillen and Newry because they were accused of transmitting the same anti-gay messages.Yet the case of the Dundalk , the right of the hard-line preachers to offend those young activists that shadow them around Belfast city centre and the Gospel tract giving, solo singing preacher man outside my window all present liberals, socialists and secularists with the “Town Square Test”.This challenge was set in  by Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident, Jewish refusenik in the USSR and human rights activist.In his book ‘The Case For Democracy’, Sharansky said the threshold test for a free society was this: “If a person cannot walk into the middle of the town square and express his or her views without fear of arrest, imprisonment or physical harm, then that person is in a fear society, not a free society.”The radical flag waving band of LGBT demonstrators who stalk their evangelical opponents have every right to a space in that ‘town square’.Yet those they protest against also deserve their place in that public square too as do the Dundalk  no matter how ludicrous, objectionable or homophobic you think their street sermons may sound.So long as no one is publicly urging violence against those with lestyles they disapprove of then their right to free speech and free preach should be defended like everyone ’s. To start cherry picking who is allowed in the ‘town square’ is the slippery slope to a nascent form of totalitarianism.As I write on this typical Belfast autumnal day with an insipidly grey sky above and a seasonal chill in the air the street beyond my window it is unusually quiet. There are no medleys of s or s cult rock classics being rattled out on guitar by the Croatian busker or any Christian hymns being sung by the dogged evangelist who often encroaches on my concentration. I hope and guess that they both willsoon to Fountain Street and continue to occupy their rightful place also in Sharansky’s ‘public square.’• Owen Polley Oct : The EU didn’t even try to address the assault on NI’s place in UK• Ben Lowry Oct : Lord Frost’s speech on NI reflected notably more robust UK tactics• Peter Robinson Oct :  Any unionist praising the Good Friday Agreement is a heretic• Ruth Dudley Edwards Oct : SF is the driving force in the Irish demonisation of Israel• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Oct : Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’• Henry McDonald Oct : The biggest task for unionists is to get out their non voters• Henry McDonald Sep : For all the gushing attitudes to the EU in Dublin, Brussels can’t rely on Ireland to help it with an EU army• Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
