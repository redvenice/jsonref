Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneA Co Offaly meat plant worker who nearly died from Covid-19 is suing his employer for personal injuries in the first known damages claim involving a case in a meat factory.Paul Feighery has taken a High Court action against Rosderra Irish Meats Group claiming that he contracted the virus while working at its plant in Roscrea, Co Tipperary.Mr Feighery took ill in March 2020. His health rapidly deteriorated and he was admitted to Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore. He spent more than two weeks on a ventilator in ICU before recovering and being discharged in May 2020. He still suffers ill effects from the disease.His solicitors, Deirdre K Ryan \u0026amp Co in Roscrea, confirmed that Mr Feighery was taking a personal injuries and negligence case against Rosderra.He is claiming damages for severe personal injuries, allegedly caused by the company’s negligence, breach of contract and breach of duty, including statutory duty.Total disregardIn his claim filed in January, he is alleging that Rosderra showed a total disregard for his safety and welfare. The company has yet to file a defence in the action.Rosderra chief executive Jim Hanley had no comment. The firm’s solicitors, Benjamin J Higgins, said: “As this matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we cannot comment at this stage.”The first legal case arising from a Covid-19 case in a meat-plant worker could spark a flurry of similar actions by people who claim they contracted the virus as a result of their working conditions.Rosderra suffered one of the biggest Covid-19 outbreaks at any workplace in the country during the first wave of the pandemic. Regarded as an essential food business, the company – the largest pig-meat processing plant in the State – remained open throughout the pandemic.Sinn Féin TD for Laois-Offaly Brian Stanley raised concerns in the Dáil about staff infections at Rosderra in April 2020 claiming that out of about 350 workers in Roscrea, up to 140 were out sick.He claimed at the time that workers who later tested positive were allowed to work next to healthy staff. The outbreak prompted the HSE to mass-test hundreds of staff for Covid-19.Meat plants have been among the workplaces worst affected by the virus as the circulation of chilled air and close-quarters working conditions encourages transmission.A surge in infections out of meat plants in August 2020 led to regional restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the first and only local lockdowns of the pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"charlie bird reaches summit of croagh patrick as 1 5m raised for charity","story":"Charlie Bird reaches the top of Croagh Patrick with his wife Claire Mould and supporters. Photograph:  Conor McKeownCharlie Bird and his supporters reached the summit of Croagh Patrick in Co Mayo\u0026nbspon Saturday afternoon\u0026nbspin an effort to raise funds for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and suicide charity Pieta.Tens of thousands of people took part in almost 200 Climb with Charlie fundraisers across the world, according to organisers.The charity campaign, led by the broadcaster Mr Bird (72) who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease last year, has already raised more than €1.5 million.Among those who took to the Reek on Saturday morning were Mr Bird’s wife, Claire, daughters, Orla and Neasa, and five grandchildren, as well as singer Daniel O’Donnell, Matt Molloy of the Chieftains, boxer Barry McGuigan and the Late Late Show host Ryan Tubridy.In a tweet on Saturday morning, President Michael D Higgins sent “every good wish and warmest support” to Mr Bird.He said: “Charlie’s strength and dignity over recent months has been a source of true inspiration to people across Ireland and beyond. I know that the public will be with him every step of the way.”Separate Climb with Charlie events were also planned across the world, in countries such as the United States, South Africa, Australia and Spain.Other climbs included a 17.5km hike up Mount Cooke in Western Australia, a 700m-high climb up Ben Gorm in Co Mayo, a 6km night-time trek from Glenmore to Barnavave peak (350m) in Co Louth, and a 494m-high hike up Cnoc Bulaba.The journey up Croagh Patrick began at 9.30am on Saturday from the mountain’s base in Westport, Co Mayo.Temperatures were expected to range between seven degrees in the east and about 10 degrees in the west “and as we climb of course it will be colder”.“I have no idea how many people are going to scale the Reek with me, but I feel it is going to be a day like no other,” he added.Mr Bird made a speech to his supporters and lit five candles in the church at the summit of the mountain one for his friend Vicky Phelan, one for people suffering a terminal illness, one for anyone in a dark place with their mental health, one for everyone involved in the fight against Covid and one for the people of Ukraine.The Climb with Charlie campaign is still accepting donations on www.climbwithcharlie.ie for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"i have found peace says charlie bird amid outpouring of public support","story":"Charlie Bird: ‘I’m not as afraid now as I was when I first got my diagnosis because I have my family around me.’ Photograph: Aidan Crawley“I have found peace, I really have,” he said of coping with his condition. “I cried every day. I don’t cry now.”Mr Bird, a veteran journalist and broadcaster, made his diagnosis public last October saying he had been given a maximum of three years to live.Since then, he explained, a flood of letters and cards from members of the public, many of whom would have watched him on their television screens over the years, had helped him adjust to his new reality.On Friday he told Late Late Show presenter Ryan Tubridy of his plans to lead a group of climbers to Co Mayo’s Croagh Patrick in April to raise money for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta House charities, and to send a message of encouragement to anyone else coping with a terminal diagnosis.His mission, under the banner Climb With Charlie, has been backed by a host of well known figures – former president Mary McAleese, architect Dermot Bannon, and retired GAA commentator Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh among them – who have vowed to join him or encourage others to undertake similar efforts elsewhere on the day.Mr Bird was due to be joined by cervical cancer campaigner Vicky Phelan whom he recently met with, but she was too ill to attend, instead sending a pre-recorded message to the show.“The support of the public around the country has lifted me like nothing else,” Mr Bird said, his voice clearly deteriorating as a consequence of his condition.He spoke of receiving letters “out the door, mass cards everything. It has been unbelievable. And in a way Ryan it has lifted me even spiritually if you understand”.Noting that people had been climbing Croagh Patrick for 1,500 years, he said it could mark the end of his own journey.“And in one sense – I mean this – I’m not as afraid now as I was when I first got my diagnosis because I have my family around me.”Mr Bird was joined by his wife Claire, daughters Orla and Neasa, and his dog Tiger who spent the initial part of his interview on his lap. One unforeseen advantage from almost four decades of broadcasting is that years of recordings of Mr Bird’s famous voice were available to a specialist company who have “banked” it and synthisised it in the event he eventually loses the ability to speak.Details of how to participate in April’s event are available at climbwithcharlie.ie and Mr Bird is hoping it will raise significant funding for motor neurone disease research.“We need to raise money … to try and save somebody’s life,” he said. “It may not save mine, it won’t, but we need to do research to try and save other people.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mardi gras in mayo as charlie bird s carnival winds up croagh patrick","story":"Climb with Charlie: Barry McGuigan, Ryan Tubridy and Charlie Bird on the summit of Croagh Patrick. Photograph: Conor McKeownThe Celtic gods of Lugh and Danú may have been confused by Charlie’s carnival caravan as it wound its way up Croagh Patrick in resplendent sunshine on Saturday morning. This pyramidal peak overlooking Clew Bay is usually associated with penitents and the Reek Sunday pilgrimage on the last Sunday of July. It may be the season of Lent but it was more Mardi Gras in Mayo as benevolent weather gods stayed mainly in check for the 764 metre-high ascent for some 10,000 people who joined the Climb for Charlie.As Chieftain Matt Molloy mused shortly after he landed in the carpark at the mountain’s base in Murrisk: “What a release after the last two years of confinement and everything we have been going through.”An Air Corps helicopter had delivered all the instruments and technical equipment to the peak on Friday but Molloy was happy to carry his flute up himself.Volunteer Maria O’Malley, who was helping direct traffic into the carparks, explained that there were over 50 people - one third of the population - from her native Clare Island waving from the top of the Big Hill across the bay.Across the carpark, Tom Tiernan, from Ballinrobe, had a van full of hazel sticks , to aid walkers and a shoebox for donations.“I lost a sister to motor neurone about ten years ago.She was a nurse and was sick for five years, it was an awful disease,” he said.Meanwhile, Charlie’s family and friends gathered in the garden behind the adjacent Campbell’s pub.Speaking to The , Charlie’s wife Claire Mould, said: “This is a very spiritual day for us. We had climbed it six years ago and really the whole thing has happened because of a throwaway comment by Charlie after his diagnosis. We are just overwhelmed by the response and the benefits it will bring to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta.”Along the pathway, Joe Freeley from Ballyhaunis was ready and waiting with doves for Charlie to release, as he, and his entourage, set off on the odyssey shortly before 10.30am.“I’ve climbed the mountain loads of times and I wanted to be here to support Charlie. We released doves in Ballyhaunis too recently for the Ukrainian people,” he explained.Dublin native Ciarán Callaghan was climbing in memory of his father who died from motor neurone disease 14 years ago, aged just 58.“I think Charlie has created a great awareness nationwide and after my Mam signed me up, we raised €2000. If I survive the climb, I’m meeting her and the kids in the Tavern bar down the road for a big lobster dinner,” he said.Broadcaster Ryan Tubridy may have landed a little late but himself and former boxer Barry McGuigan were determined to catch up with Charlie and bounded up the lower slopes like two March - oops! - April hares. McGuigan later likened Tubridy to “a gazelle”.The sun may have become more tentative but the children from Brackloon NS were waiting for Charlie on the shoulder, about half way up.Pupil JJ Kenny (9) said: “Charlie called to our school on Thursday and he gave every pupil an elbow. He is brilliant.”No better man than Donegal crooner, Daniel O’Donnell to act as MC as the hordes negotiated the final approach of slippery shale on the precipitous peak.It didn’t matter about the cold mists - a magical micro-climate - sporadically enveloping the peak. Nature held its breath as Charlie’s message of hope - a recording made with special cloning technology - boomed across the skies.Referring to his “mad idea” to climb the Reek, he said that “you never know what is around the corner” but that “for every moment he is around he will extend the hand of friendship to people”.The poignancy continued when Daniel sang the Bruce Springsteen song, “Dream Baby Dream”, which had been played at Charlie and Claire’s wedding in 2016. But it was a song called “Irish Heroes” written by Des Cafferkey of the Clew Bay Pipe Band in the aftermath of the Rescue 116 helicopter crash off Blacksod that left Charlie Bird breaking down in tears.He wasn’t the only one.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures to drop below freezing on saturday night","story":"Lowest temperatures of -4 and +1 degrees are forecast over Saturday night.

They were wrong.”Yet Marina remains remarkably upbeat as she chats about her past, present and future, showing the strength of character that has got her this far, and which she still believes will see her facing Putin in the International Criminal Court one day.Her biggest ambition in life is “to live longer than Putin, and one day see him tried for war crimes and for the murder of my husband”. The war in Ukraine might even have brought that day closer.For now, though, Marina has a rather more introspective mission at hand. She and her son Anatoly are about to begin work on a joint memoir about Alexander, about his murder, and about the international criminal investigation that has dominated their lives ever since.Anatoly was just 12 when his dissident father died, and Marina believes the process of writing a book together will not only help them to relive cherished memories of Alexander, but also confront unresolved, unspoken elements of their grief.“Anatoly was definitely traumatised by his father’s death,” she says of the boy who was taken to see Alexander as he lay dying in University College Hospital, “but he was very protective of what he was feeling inside. He didn’t cry, and it was only when he got older that he started to talk about it.“When we write this memoir together it will be interesting to hear maybe for the first time his feelings about what happened, from his perspective.”Anatoly, now 28, still lives with his mother in their small flat in West London. He has been working as a paralegal but has decided his future lies in IT and is about to embark on a course in computer coding.Marina and her son talk about Alexander – or Sasha, to use the Russian diminutive form – “a lot” and she has always tried to impress on him the fact that “yes, your father died, but in some way he is with us”.Keeping Alexander’s memory alive, of course, has been a highly public affair for Marina, but not one which came easily.“I’m a very private person,” she says, “and I’m always really surprised when people recognise me in the street, though they are always very polite and generous.“What I do in public, I am doing for my husband, but it doesn’t come naturally. When he was lying in that hospital bed I refused to do any interviews. Sasha said I should do them, and tell people what was happening, but I thought he was going to recover so I never thought I would need to.”Before his death at the age of 44, Litvinenko dictated a statement to be read after his passing, in which he said: “You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” Putin’s blood-curdling reaction to Alexander’s death was to say: “The people that have done this are not God, and Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus.”A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen concluded in 2016 that Litvinenko had been the victim of a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly KGB) assassination “probably” approved by Putin.It named two Russian agents, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, as his killers they had slipped a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 into a pot of tea drunk by Litvinenko when they held a meeting with him on Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at London’s Millennium Hotel.Litvinenko told Marina that as he sipped his tea, “in one second he realised something wasn’t right”.Twenty-two days later, he was dead and she believes that if he had finished the cup he might have died very quickly, meaning the cause of his death might never have been detected.Two days after the meeting, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, before being transferred to University College Hospital on November 17 when his condition worsened. Doctors diagnosed acute radiation syndrome, and on November 23, after losing consciousness, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died after attempts to resuscitate him failed.And so he became the key witness in the investigation into his own murder. The public inquiry was a personal triumph for Marina, who had spent an entire decade pushing for it, despite the obvious risks to her own safety from taking on Putin and his hitmen.I ask if she feels she has to spend her life looking over her shoulder, but she says she has never had bodyguards and refuses to allow security concerns to constrain her.“In 2006 I was given close communication with the police, which meant I could always contact someone 24 hours a day, and I still have that access, but I don’t really need it,” she says.“I do pay attention to what happens around me – if I see the same person cropping up too many times I might want to know why.”Later this year a four-part ITV series, starring David Tennant as Litvinenko, will dramatise the murder and Marina’s fight for justice, which she hopes will bring the story to a new audience too young to remember the scarcely believable events of November 2006.Anatoly acted as a consultant for the series, but contractual obligations elsewhere meant she could not be involved in the production. Did she meet Tennant? She blushes and smiles, which gives away the answer, even though the official version is that they have never met.Marina, who will soon celebrate her 60th birthday, retains the unmistakable poise of her former life as a ballroom dancer (she still teaches dance), and sits straight-backed on the edge of a sofa as she sips green tea at a hotel near her west London home.]She recalls her first meeting with Alexander, in 1993, when he was working for the FSB investigating organised crime – she was 31 and he was 30.“I had heard about him before I met him,” she says, “and I was really quite surprised when this very young man arrived, looking quite shy. He certainly wasn’t what you expect a KGB man to be!”She was meeting friends for drinks on her birthday (“I always joked afterwards that he was my birthday present,” she says) and Alexander accompanied a friend of hers who was nervous about her safety because of her involvement in a case he was investigating.“Sasha gave you so much confidence. He supported you, he protected you, you felt very confident around him, whether you were his wife, his friend or his child. I never thought I could feel so loved, so protected and so happy.“He was always very open-minded, open to anything new. I never thought I would find all of those qualities in one person.”She also, of course, remembers the last time they spoke, and tears prick her eyes as she recalls leaving his hospital bedside to go home to Anatoly for the night.“I told him: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon’,” she says. “He said: ‘I love you so much’, and he looked so sad. I tried to make a joke by saying ‘finally you tell me!’, but it was the last thing he said to me. Two hours later he was unconscious.”Campaigning for justice can be lonely work, and Marina does not rule out marrying again one day, saying the idea of having another relationship “isn’t a problem to me”, but that any suitor would have to realise that “Sasha will always be in my life, so it would have to be a strong personality to accept that because most people want to be the only one”.At the start of our interview, before bombarding her with questions about her husband, about Ukraine, about Putin, about Roman Abramovich and so much more, I ask her if there are any particular messages she wants to get across, and her answer comes as a surprise.“Firstly, I’m worried about Russophobia,” she says, without pausing for thought. “Of course I support sanctions against Russia, but now people don’t even want to play Russian music, they want to boycott Russian composers. It’s stupid. The past 100 years have not been good for Russia, but it is also the country that produced Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev.”She accepts that it might seem odd to some people that she is so passionate about defending the country that murdered her husband, but she believes that “there may be a chance for Russia to become a different country” in future.Could she ever see herself going back to a Putin-free Russia if a modern-day Gorbachev were to take over one day and bring about a new glasnost?“When I left Russia I didn’t think I had left forever,” she says, recalling the couple’s arrival in the UK as political refugees in 2000. “There were people who left during the Cold War that knew they were leaving for good, but for me I thought it was going to be temporary.“Now, though, I would be more happy to go to live in Ukraine. It’s a very similar culture I have friends there and there will be plenty of work to do in rebuilding the country once the war is over.”She praises British people for being so “welcoming and open” to taking in Ukrainian refugees, but warns that “they need to be serious about it. “It’s not just about being generous it’s about being capable of supporting people who are traumatised, who have just come from a war zone. People also need to be prepared to be in this for the long haul you can’t just reject someone after a couple of weeks.”She does not have space in the small flat she shares with her son to be able to house a refugee, but is acting as a liaison for others who want to open their homes. She admits the war took her by surprise – a few days before the invasion, Moscow-born Marina was in Ukraine visiting friends in the south-west of the country.“I didn’t think there was going to be an invasion at all,” she admits, “or certainly nothing beyond the Donbas region. There were so many reasons for Putin not to do it, especially the effect that sanctions would have, that I thought he would hold back.”She says the West has been guilty of a collective failure to see Putin for what he is – “someone who has turned Russia into a mafia state and then a terrorist state” – because successive leaders have convinced themselves they knew how to handle him.“During the Cold War it was simple, because the West didn’t really have any personal relationships with Russia,” she says. “But after glasnost the West started doing business with Russia, private companies got deeply involved, personal relationships formed and they wanted to give Putin the benefit of the doubt.”She recalled George W Bush’s meeting with Putin in June 2001, when the US president said he had “looked the man in the eye” and found him to be “straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul”.“No-one believed the president of Russia was a real monster,” she says, “but he is and my husband Sasha tried to show it before his death, and he tried to show it through his death.“Russia carried out an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil by murdering Sasha, and it should have been a watershed moment, but it wasn’t.“In 2010 the new government of the UK gave Russia another chance to build its relationship, and more money came in, big donors with Russian surnames gave money to the Conservative Party. It was a big mistake.”She fears the West will become “fatigued” with the situation in Ukraine, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky will accept a peace deal that would be too advantageous to Russia.“It might suit western leaders to push Zelensky into agreeing everything Putin wants so that they can move on, but the Ukrainian people would not accept that, so it won’t be over.”She even suggests that Zelensky’s position as president could be in doubt if he is too accommodating, despite his Churchillian popularity at present.It is Marina’s misfortune that she knows more about Russia’s use of poisons than almost anyone else in the UK, so what does she believe happened to Abramovich, who claims he was poisoned while acting as a go-between in peace talks?“I believe this is all part of a propaganda exercise to frame Ukraine,” she says. “The Russians have already tried to suggest that Ukraine has chemical weapons so that they can stage false flag operations if they want to, and I think Russia will tell its people that Ukraine has tried to poison Abramovich.She believes that ultimately, Putin’s miscalculation in invading Ukraine could have profound consequences for him. “Russia could break up it’s such a huge country that it’s a nightmare to govern, as history has shown.”As for the war, she is concerned that Putin could use battlefield nuclear weapons, but thinks he would not risk all-out nuclear war because “he doesn’t look like a kamikaze he likes his money and his yachts too much”.Even if Putin were to give the order to use tactical nuclear weapons, Marina still has enough faith in the country of her birth to believe his soldiers would refuse to carry out their orders.“My husband refused to carry out orders to kill people,” she says. “I still believe Russia has heroes.”More from NewsUkraine afternoon briefing: Five developments as Russian troops disperse protest rally with stun grenades\u0026#39In three weeks we welcomed two million refugees – it was a miracle\u0026#39‘It is like 1937’: Informants denounce anti-Ukraine war RussiansWhy Britain’s Covid outlook veers between ‘glorious sunshine and blizzards’Shock and disgust as NHS trusts still push for ‘natural births’ despite damning Ockenden reportTory MP David Warburton has whip withdrawn during investigation by harassment watchdogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream disintegrating eyes","story":"Over the last decade the American presidency has passed from a man who arrived at his Inaugural shaking his fist in the air like a tinpot dictator to one who carelessly inserts dangerously impulsive remarks into crucial diplomatic speeches. What on earth is going on here?Of course, the United States, like all mass democracies, has had some pretty poor leaders over the centuries. Those figures who embodied the great moments in its history - Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt - are memorable because they are rare. But what is happening now seems like something more than a routine spell of mediocrity which will pass with the coming of a new generation.What is wrong with the presidency seems more closely connected to what is happening in the wider society: nothing less than a collapse of the political culture which affects the daily lives of ordinary people in ways that failures of the federal power structures rarely have.It is important to understand that throughout much of the country’s history, the complexion and competence of the government in Washington had relatively little bearing on the everyday quality of local American life. The quite explicit design of the Constitution guaranteeing states’ rights ensured this. It was the clear intention of the Founding Fathers to limit the central authority of Washington which was seen as a threat to the self-determination of citizens almost on a par with colonial rule. The explosive confrontations between federal and state authority over the abolition of slavery and, a century later, the enforcement of racial integration, were the most vivid examples of this but disputes over abortion and gun laws still revolve around that basic principle, built into the nation’s idea of itself, of state autonomy.Very rarely, in fact, has the quality and tenor of the presidency seemed so closely aligned with the state of the nation in ways which can be felt in the streets and the homes of real people. The demoralisation and paralysis in Washington plays out in everyday experience. There is endless news coverage of crime, racial violence and civil disorder on a scale that many Americans believed until quite recently was behind them, as well as the continued decline of what would once have been thriving industrial enterprise. But much more ubiquitous and bewildering is the sense that the idea of an American mission - the country’s original idea of itself - has disintegrated. The collapse of that self-belief, of the accepted understanding of what America was for, is stunning.But, you may ask, what is so different and dangerous about this? After all, identity crises of a similar kind have occurred in many countries - particularly former imperial powers which have had to come to terms with their role in a changed world order. There can be a temporary nervous breakdown and then a recovery which reframes a country’s goals. Why shouldn’t this formula which appeared to work in so many European countries apply in the United States with its famously enterprising and adaptable population? Because America is different. I would venture to say that it is much more different from any Old World society than most Europeans appreciate. In the sentimental twentieth century, there was understood to be an American Dream which animated the hopes and aspirations of those millions who arrived there in search of safety, freedom and economic opportunity. The real truth is that America itself was a dream: its national identity, and the patriotism which was a mandatory part of it, was a beautiful fiction created by a small group of people and sanctified by a handful of superb documents which enshrined the 18th century idea of liberty under the law.Most pertinently, this new entity was intended to bind all incomers from anywhere in the world into a cohesive society which was prepared to accommodate anyone who would sign up to the social contract that was on offer. (This is precisely how the Constitution is taught to American schoolchildren: as a contract between the government and the people.) This was an unprecedented political project. Not even the original French revolution which based itself on a similar Enlightenment foundation had done anything like this: attempted to invent an entirely new nation composed of disparate, displaced people which would somehow cohere into a proud unified sense of statehood and inidual belonging. And miraculously, for the longest time it worked. The patriotic rituals which most Europeans found faintly absurd, if not positively sinister, like the pledge of allegiance to the flag which began every school day, served their purpose. The children of immigrants, many of whom, like my grandparents, spoke only the language of the Old Country, went to school and learnt - like my father - to speak English. They became proud Americans who wanted more than anything to belong to this new thing that they felt a part of and were told that their commitment had helped to create.True, there was a constant tension between loyalty to the American national identity and the sense of one’s family roots. So there were communities of Italian-Americans and Polish-Americans and Irish-Americans (like Joe Biden) who never forgot where they came from even though anything that hinted at a lack of full-hearted commitment to America was a kind of blasphemy. But even that uneasy settlement is finished now. The contractual agreement that Americans were one people with one sense of purpose, has been smashed to pieces by wilful isiveness: identity politics which sees historic injustice as unforgivable and life choices as creating irreconcilable differences, have blown apart that fragile accord.The people who abandoned their inherited identities in order to take part in this extraordinary, brave project are now faced with the consequences of rootlessness. Without the resources that go with generations of life in a recognisable place they are lost. Maybe the great American experiment has finally failed.More from NewsUkraine afternoon briefing: Five developments as Russian troops disperse protest rally with stun grenades\u0026#39In three weeks we welcomed two million refugees – it was a miracle\u0026#39‘It is like 1937’: Informants denounce anti-Ukraine war RussiansWhy Britain’s Covid outlook veers between ‘glorious sunshine and blizzards’Shock and disgust as NHS trusts still push for ‘natural births’ despite damning Ockenden reportTory MP David Warburton has whip withdrawn during investigation by harassment watchdogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccinations open five 11 year olds england","story":"Bookings opened on Saturday for children aged five to 11 in England to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.Children will be offered two doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, at least 12 weeks apart, at a third of the normal strength.Parents and carers can arrange appointments for Monday onwards through the NHS vaccines website or by calling 119 from 7am on Saturday morning. NHS England said hundreds of sites will offer jabs from Monday, with more coming on stream throughout the week.Some five million children are eligible for the jab, following on from the success of the campaign to vaccinate vulnerable youngsters with health conditions.Most new appointments will be at local vaccination centres or community pharmacies outside of school hours, and there will be walk-in clinics available, with timings on the NHS Grab a Jab website.NHS England said more appointments will be added throughout the week so anyone unable to get a convenient slot should keep trying.The development comes as a record 4.9 million people in the UK were estimated to have had the virus in the week ending March 26, according to the Office for National Statistics - up from 4.3 million the week before. The surge in Covid cases also came as free tests ended for most people in England on Friday.The ONS figures revealed that Covid infections among people aged 35 and over in England have reached record levels, with notable increases in the oldest groups. Prevalence of Covid is higher among these groups than at any point since ONS estimates began in spring 2020.Prevalence of the virus among the over-70s has been at an all-time high for several weeks, and climbed again to 6.6 per cent, or one in 15 people, in the seven days to March 26. Meanwhile, infections among 50 to 69-year-olds hit a record high for the second week in a row and stand at 7.2 per cent, the equivalent of one in 14 people.An estimated eight per cent of people aged 35 to 49 were also likely to have had the virus last week, or around one in 13.However, prevalence among all age groups remains highest for children between the age two and school year 6, with one in 11 likely to have had Covid-19 last week.Calum Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told Sky News: This is now a vaccine-preventable disease and the vaccine is safer than the disease.It\u0027s a very unpleasant illness for children. And if they have a weakened immune system or if they live in a family where a member has a weakened immune system, the consequences can be devastating. So yes I am pleased.Prof Semple, who advises the Government as part of Sage, said the vaccine will reduce days lost from education.Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and the deputy lead for the NHS Covid-19 Vaccination Programme, said: From today, parents of almost five million five to 11-year-olds can book their little ones in for a vaccine, ensuring they get their first dose of protection and helping to protect against potential future waves of Covid-19.Vaccines remain the best defence we have against the virus - my 13-year-old son has had his two vaccinations and I\u0027ll be booking my 10-year-old daughter in for hers at the earliest opportunity, and would encourage all parents to read the NHS information available and consider doing the same.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: From Monday, the NHS will be rolling out the non-urgent offer for Covid vaccines for all children aged five to 11 in England.Parents, if they want, can take up the offer for their children to increase protection against Covid as we learn to live with this virus.Children without underlying health conditions are at low risk of serious illness from Covid and the priority remains for the NHS to offer vaccines and spring boosters to adults and vulnerable young people, as well as to catch up with other childhood immunisation programmes.More from NewsUkraine afternoon briefing: Five developments as Russian troops disperse protest rally with stun grenades\u0026#39In three weeks we welcomed two million refugees – it was a miracle\u0026#39‘It is like 1937’: Informants denounce anti-Ukraine war RussiansWhy Britain’s Covid outlook veers between ‘glorious sunshine and blizzards’Shock and disgust as NHS trusts still push for ‘natural births’ despite damning Ockenden reportTory MP David Warburton has whip withdrawn during investigation by harassment watchdogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron losing le pen now real possibility","story":"How do you solve a problem like Marine? This is the question troubling Emmanuel Macron nine days before the French vote in the first round of the presidential election. In the last fortnight opinion polls have shown that Macron’s stock is falling and Le Pen’s rising.Such a scenario was inconceivable at the start of the year. The name on everyone’s lips then was Eric Zemmour, the right-wing polemicist, who announced his candidature with a promise to go after Islam and immigration. But Zemmour has peaked, his manifesto too narrow and too nasty, appealing in the main to right wing middle-class Catholics. Le Pen, on the other hand, is popular among the young and the working class, particularly blue-collar workers who in an earlier age would have voted for the left what we in Britain would call Red Wall voters. Economically, Le Pen has always leaned to the left, and in recent years she’s softened her stance on many social issues.In a debate last year with Macron’s Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, she was mocked for being ‘soft’ on Islam. Unlike Zemmour – and it would seem Darmanin – Le Pen has no grudge with Islam, only with Islamic extremists. And herein lies the problem for president Macron: how can he describe Le Pen’s National Rally party as extreme right when his own Interior Minister ridiculed her on live television for being soft on Islam? The fact is that Macron has at times during his presidency acted in such a heavy-handed and authoritarian way that great swathes of the public won’t fall for his alarmist rhetoric about the advance of the “far right”. This, after all, is a president whose police force inflicted scores of terrible injuries on demonstrators during the Yellow Vest protests of 201819, injuries that were condemned by the UN, the European Parliament and human rights organisations. This is a president who subjected his country to probably the most stringent lockdown measures of any western nation, and then sneered that his objective in introducing a Covid Passport was to “piss off” the unvaccinated or those unwilling to have a third jab.During a television debate on Thursday evening Le Pen referenced the Covid Passport, expressing her disapproval of the draconian measure and portraying herself as the champion of the nation’s liberté. Le Pen looked confident as she fielded questions from journalists and members of the public. She believes the force is with her.Inflation, crime and energy prices are all on the rise in France, and so are the number of Covid cases. It was only a month ago that Macron told his people he had won his war on the virus and consequently masks and Covid Passports were no longer necessary. He dare not reimpose either before the election because he knows what his political adversaries would say: voila, yet more proof that this is a president who fails on all fronts.Instead Macron’s strategy in the final week of campaigning is negativity, to resort to the tried and trusted, to go on the attack against the “extreme right”. In the past it’s worked, but it is unlikely to work this time in the event of a second round head to head between Macron and Le Pen. Macron is loathed by millions on the left and they will not heed his call to lend him their vote to keep out Le Pen.Just as Britain’s Red Wall collapsed in 2019, in 2022 it could be the turn of France’s Republican Front to disintegrate and when the dust settles France could have its first female president.More from NewsUkraine afternoon briefing: Five developments as Russian troops disperse protest rally with stun grenades\u0026#39In three weeks we welcomed two million refugees – it was a miracle\u0026#39‘It is like 1937’: Informants denounce anti-Ukraine war RussiansWhy Britain’s Covid outlook veers between ‘glorious sunshine and blizzards’Shock and disgust as NHS trusts still push for ‘natural births’ despite damning Ockenden reportTory MP David Warburton has whip withdrawn during investigation by harassment watchdogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"net zero conspiracy against british voters","story":"The law has never looked like more of an ass than in the decision by a court to issue an interim driving disqualification to a mother who used her Range Rover gently to nudge Insulate Britain protesters who were blocking the road.Sherrilyn Speid, 35, of Grays, Essex, pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving when she appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court on Monday.She had been on her way to drop her child off at school when she came across an Insulate Britain protest near the M25 last October at about 8.30am.Two members of the group, wearing high-vis jackets, were seen sitting in front of her vehicle while another stood in front of it, holding on to the bonnet.The scene was caught on camera by a passer-by and heavily bleeped footage was shown in court in which Ms Speid shouted: “Move out the way. I’m not joking, my son needs to get to school and I need to get to work.”It is clear whose side the public are on here.And this applies more generally to the green debate, as well. A recent survey found that nearly half (48 per cent) of the population thinks higher energy bills are not a price worth paying to achieve net zero – compared with just 20 per cent who said they were.The proportion of those unhappy to pay more to achieve net zero has risen from 40 per cent when Redfield and Wilton Strategies last asked that question in October.With energy prices up more than 50 per cent from yesterday, the net zero dream is about to become a nightmare for us all.But do the politicians see that? Of course not. As the public is confronted with the cost of decades of political complacency on energy policy, the consensus in Westminster remains overwhelmingly that net zero must stay.More from NewsUkraine afternoon briefing: Five developments as Russian troops disperse protest rally with stun grenades\u0026#39In three weeks we welcomed two million refugees – it was a miracle\u0026#39‘It is like 1937’: Informants denounce anti-Ukraine war RussiansWhy Britain’s Covid outlook veers between ‘glorious sunshine and blizzards’Shock and disgust as NHS trusts still push for ‘natural births’ despite damning Ockenden reportTory MP David Warburton has whip withdrawn during investigation by harassment watchdogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"norman tebbit many people politics today rather poor material","story":"The soothing charm of Bury St Edmunds, with its refined Georgian houses and elegant public buildings, is not a setting one might immediately associate with a man who made his name as the great political street fighter of his generation. But it is in the shadow, appropriately, of the Suffolk town’s great Norman Tower, in one of these handsome houses that another great Norman has chosen to spend his retirement after stepping down from the House of Lords last month: Lord Tebbit, the Chingford Skinhead, the ‘semi-house-trained polecat’, the man who told the unemployed to get on their bikes, the Tory who was more Thatcherite than Mrs Thatcher herself.Tebbit and I have been friends for so long that I can’t recall when I first met him: it was, I think, just before the 1987 general election, when he had returned to be chairman of the Conservative Party after recovering from the devastating injuries he sustained in the IRA’s attack on the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984, during the party conference. The footage of him and his wife Margaret being pulled from the rubble early on that eerily still October morning still has the power to shock not only had the Tebbits nearly been killed, but Margaret’s injuries were so severe that she spent the remaining 36 years of her life in a wheelchair. In all the years I have known Tebbit we have never discussed this life-changing moment, so it is somewhat surreal to hear him today, at 91 – spare figure stooped with age, neatly dressed in a pullover and tie, brilliantined hair white – recollecting such a dramatic event from the serenity of his drawing room. ‘The bombing did make an enormous difference to me,’ he recalls with trademark understatement. ‘Margaret and I had gone to bed. I’d not really wanted to stay on that Thursday night – I just wanted to get home – but I thought it might look a bit untidy on the platform if I wasn’t there. We were woken by the explosion – it was not a big bomb, but big enough to destabilise the big brick chimney, which collapsed. Margaret and I were injured, bleeding, tangled up, and I doubted whether we were going to survive.’‘We were semi-conscious, Margaret and I: there are those famous pictures of me being dug out. A bloke in the back of the ambulance with me, as they took me to hospital, remembers saying to me before he gave me a painkilling injection, “Are you allergic to anything?” and I replied, “Oh yes, bombs.”’Tebbit cracks jokes whenever he can. But as he rattles around his big house, there is a sadness about him that suggests life’s heavy toll sometimes catches up. He was widowed just before Christmas 2020 he and Margaret had been married for 64 years, and their loyalty to one another was fierce. When we speak of Margaret’s death he remains stoical, but the pain is still evident. ‘It was pretty devastating,’ he says. ‘I woke in the night, put my hand out to her and found she was cold, and that she was dead, and that was quite awful.’ The pair met in 1955 when he was a young pilot in the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF) and she a nurse. Young Tebbit had originally, at 16, gone to work at the Financial Times, where, with the help of his school, Edmonton Grammar, he had landed a job putting together the share prices page. ‘The great objective was to see if one could get through an obscene sub-heading for a paragraph,’ Tebbit recalls with a chuckle. ‘All the successes were posted on the wall. Phillips’ rubber soles were very useful in that respect.’ After a national service stint in the RAF, however, the appeal of rude headlines had waned. ‘I got bored,’ he admits. He went off to sell advertising, but kept his hand in as a pilot in the RAuxAF, joining 604 County of Middlesex Squadron. ‘I entered another new world – my flight commander was a partner in a leading firm of solicitors, the CO was a Lloyd’s underwriter. I then began to grow up.’ Not that his childhood until that time had been without event. Tebbit grew up on the borders of Enfield and Edmonton, where Hertfordshire and Essex meet. His father had fought on the Western Front in the First World War, and the post-traumatic stress, or shell shock as it was then, meant that ‘the rest of his life was just useless. He couldn’t cope with anything, really.’ It was his mother, the daughter of a butcher, ‘a very tough lady’, who ‘managed everything. In 1926, at the heart of the general strike she was delivering meat to customers in a pony and trap when a picket line tried to stop her. She simply whipped the pony first and, as they rode through the line, whipped the pickets too.’ Tebbit was eight when war broke out. ‘Probably my most powerful early memory was being at home with my parents and hearing Mr Chamberlain in 1939 say that Herr Hitler had not responded to his ultimatum, and therefore we were at war. And I remember rushing to the window and looking out to see if things looked any different. ‘At the beginning of the war, my brother, who’s three years older than me, and I were evacuated to South Wales. It was so heavily bombed we were brought back home.’ But there was bombing there too: ‘We had a lot of air raids and had to use an outdoor Anderson shelter, which was bloody awful. ‘Towards the end of the war, during the flying bomb raids, my parents were in the shelter and my older brother and I were sitting outside when we heard a doodlebug. When the engine cut, if you didn’t hear it coming down it was going to be pretty close. Well, when it came down, the door flew open, and several houses on the other side of the road were destroyed.’His father’s experiences were what made him choose the RAF for his national service. ‘I didn’t want to risk what my father had gone through. Remembering that we had nearly lost the Battle of Britain, not because we were running out of aircraft, but because we were running out of pilots, I volunteered – I had been highly impressed by the Battle as a child. I got my wings, and started flying Meteor fighters.’ His subsequent return to the RAuxAF sounds idyllic. ‘Somebody once asked me what I did with my childhood. I replied, “I delayed it.” My childhood was spent growing up in 604 Squadron.’As he talks about those days it is clear that it was the camaraderie, and the chance to meet people outside his normal suburban circles, that he found the most appealing. Not least because it also led him to Margaret. He was not entirely oblivious to the opposite sex, thanks to his time at school. ‘It was unusual for those days in that it was a mixed school. There were these girl things, which was interesting because I hadn’t got any sisters, and so one talked to girls.’ Margaret was the daughter of a tenant farmer from Cambridgeshire. They married six months after they met, in 1956, at which point Tebbit decided to put his practical skills to better use in order to fund their married life. He took a job with BOAC, flying mostly on routes to Africa, the Far East and down to Australia. Although he had landed an enviable job, the strains on family life were soon apparent once their first son, John, was born in 1958. Like many pilots, Tebbit found he was rostered to be away on special family occasions, and this became more apparent after their daughter Alison was born two years later William, their third child, was born in 1965. By that stage Tebbit had taken the initiative. ‘I noticed many pilots would simply call in sick when they wanted to be at home, which was causing chaos. I suggested that we be allowed to take control of our own rosters. We did, and it worked: absenteeism dropped like a stone. It was a lesson for my life in politics – always look at the roots of a problem and not just its symptoms if you want to solve it.’Despite this, life with three small children took its toll. After William was born, Margaret suffered from postnatal depression and ended up in hospital, leaving Tebbit in charge of a seven-year-old, a toddler and a newborn. ‘I managed.’ It would not be the last time he would do so. A ll his life Tebbit had been influenced by his upbringing, by a clear understanding of the link between effort and reward, and by the importance of seizing opportunities when they presented themselves. Even before his national service, he became a Young Conservative, because, ‘I realised I was not a statist.’ This was during the period when the Attlee administration, which had ruled since Labour’s landslide victory in 1945, had started to nationalise industries it considered strategically important and to provide cradle-to-grave welfarism. Tebbit had been forced to join a print union when he worked at the FT, and it had given him a loathing of the power of the closed shop. Everything in his upbringing – not least the self-reliance of his parents – had taught him that it was the growth of the inidual, and not of the state or of collectives, that was the key to a successful future. However, during the 1950s and 1960s, the leadership of the Conservative Party did not always think like Norman Tebbit.The parliamentary party had, though, ceased to be the preserve of the privileged classes, exemplified by Ted Heath – from a similar background to Tebbit – becoming leader in 1965. Tebbit, as a party activist in Hertfordshire, disapproved of Heath’s consensual policies, and increasingly in the late 1960s of his management of the party. In a fit of frustration, he wrote a letter of protest to Iain Macleod, a leading member of the shadow cabinet and former party chairman on whose judgment Heath relied heavily. Years earlier, Tebbit had been on the selection committee at Enfield that had chosen Macleod. ‘I wrote to him, presuming on our acquaintance, telling him what was wrong, and what should be done to put it right – I was a young man and so knew all these things! He replied that, if I thought things were wrong and I knew how to put it right, why didn’t I go and help them do it? And I remember saying to my wife, “I bloody well will.”’This was quite a leap from being an airline pilot, but Tebbit had acquired a taste for wider political involvement at a time when his party wanted people such as him – self-made men and women who could relate to an electorate increasingly full of voters with a similar background. Once he had made his decision, Tebbit threw himself into the process of trying to become an MP.‘I knew I had to fight a hopeless seat, do well, and then get a safe Tory seat. I decided the place for me was Epping, which included Harlow New Town, which was a rather Corbynista place,’ he observes. ‘Ninety per cent of the housing was owned by the New Town Commission or the council, and the Labour Party went round at election time to help people put their posters up – or rather, to tell them they were going to put their posters up.‘I think their majority was seven or eight thousand. We fought a good campaign: Stan Newens, my Labour opponent, was very indignant about my first piece of election literature. It was a picture of me standing beside a civil aircraft in my uniform, and it said: “Why does a man with one of the best jobs in Britain want to do something else?” The only place where the word “Conservative” was mentioned was in the imprint at the bottom.’The contest was tight. ‘On the night of the count it became obvious it was close. A recount was called, and I was duly elected: which was not the plan at all. I woke up the next morning in bed in a hotel in Epping and said to my wife, “Oh Christ, what have I done now?”‘She was very supportive, but was a bit shattered about it too. It meant a complete change in our life. She had to go back to nursing to help make ends meet.’The Tory party of the early 1970s was a turbulent place. ‘It was soon quite clear that Heath was making a balls of it. And Airey Neave took me to one side to ask me who I thought would make a better leader. I said, “I don’t know enough.” He replied, “You’d better come and talk to Margaret Thatcher,” whom I’d never spoken to before.‘Having met her, I agreed that she was the one. We had quite a long conversation. What struck me about her was that she was the daughter of a lower-middle-class shopkeeper in middle England. She was a qualified scientist and had worked as one. She was a Christian and she had a powerful intellect. You could guess where she was going to go.’Since he has mentioned Christianity, it occurs to me that there is another conversation we have never had in all these years, but which, given all he has been through, might be relevant. ‘Do you consider yourself a religious man, Norman?’He looks especially contemplative. ‘I started off as an atheist and slid across to being an agnostic: I felt that one couldn’t be certain whether God existed, but I thought it would be rather a good idea if He did, and took more of an interest in our affairs. I have gradually slid to being on the believer edge, so I am an occasional attendee at the cathedral here.’As for whether particular experience of the bomb had affected his view of God, he says, ‘No, I don’t think so. I remember coming round in hospital and finding a nurse sitting next to me. She told me what had happened. I’d suffered a hell of a lot of injuries – broken collar bone, several broken ribs, some had penetrated my chest cavity and my lungs, several vertebrae though not, thank God, my spinal cord, the top of my left hip, and all sorts of bits and pieces.’He was moved to Stoke Mandeville to be with Margaret, who was in the spinal injuries unit there. He was made to eat all he could to build up his body tissue. ‘The doctor said to me, “It’s bloody awful food, so to assist you I’ll send you in a case of red wine, which you can keep under the bed.” It was the health service at its best.’Severe though his injuries were, they did not compare with his wife’s. ‘I realised that she was very badly injured right from the beginning. It was clear that she was never going to walk again.’ It was six months before he could return to work, so he ran his department, with the help of officials, from his hospital bed. Considering the extent of Margaret’s handicap, did he consider leaving public life at once?‘No. That would have been to give the IRA another victory… The only occasion when I was ever cheered from all sides of the House was when I came back in after the hospital to take my seat.’ At the time of the bomb, Tebbit was Secretary of State for Trade, running the Thatcher programme of privatisation. He was seen as a natural successor to her: he had already become ‘the Chingford Skinhead’ – a coinage believed to have been made by Private Eye and, thanks to Michael Foot, also a ‘semi-house-trained polecat’. Did he mind? ‘No. Not really. It made me laugh. I remember calling Foot a fascist. He was upset about that. He was even more upset the next day when a newspaper said, “Tebbit was right: Foot is a fascist.”’He declined to serve, however, in the cabinet after the 1987 election. ‘It was because of my need to earn more money to look after Margaret.’Above his desk there is a photograph of Tebbit, sleek and dashing in white tie and tails, looking tenderly at Margaret as she dabs her eyes. It was taken when she went out in public for the first time after the bomb, at a smart City dinner. One only needed a few moments with Margaret to gauge the extent of her heroism, but Tebbit’s, in overcoming the attempt to murder both of them and then devoting much of the rest of his life to caring for her, is no less immense. The bombing remained with him. A couple of years ago, he finally gave up game shooting: I used to see him twice every season at a pheasant shoot in Norfolk where his Danish son-in-law Paul was the estate manager. I can testify to his accuracy – and he was rumoured to mutter ‘Adams’ or ‘McGuinness’ every time he pulled the trigger.   ‘I was once asked what would I do if I bumped into Adams and McGuinness. I said that as long as I was driving a heavy truck when I bumped into them I would laugh. The IRA were the great beneficiaries of the Good Friday Agreement. They were all given get-out-of-jail-free cards by Blair, while they continue to prosecute the soldiers who were trying to protect people against the IRA: monstrous, absolutely monstrous.’He thinks public life has changed ‘for the worse’ in his half-century in Parliament. ‘There have always been bounders of one kind or another. But now I think there are far more people who have gone into politics with the aim of getting into a job in government, and they have on the whole been rather poor material. There are one or two who’ve got ability and integrity. I think the leader of those is the Chancellor. But I think you could make a better cabinet, a smaller cabinet, and a cabinet principally of people who had not been career politicians all their lives.’So what now for Tebbit the polecat? Now that he has retired, will he slide gracefully into the sunset? He has full-time carers and he is close to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Tebbit family values remain cast-iron, and all three of his children provide a serious support group for him.He feels comfortable in Bury, and plans to spend the rest of his days there. ‘After Margaret died I thought whether I should sell this place, and go and live in sheltered accommodation. Then I realised I might not like that, and I’d have buggered it all up. So I’m going to stay here. It’s a lovely house. I’ve got my office and I’ve got my library, and I get a huge number of emails.’It seems that there will be no sliding away for Norman Tebbit, whose iron resolve will doubtless cause him to seek controversy outside the Lords just as he did inside it. ‘My coat of arms,’ he tells me with a twinkle as I leave, ‘has a polecat on it.’More from NewsPrince Andrew says he wept over the suffering in Ukraine, as he recalls his own experiences of warUkraine afternoon briefing: Five developments as Russian troops disperse protest rally with stun grenades\u0026#39In three weeks we welcomed two million refugees – it was a miracle\u0026#39‘It is like 1937’: Informants denounce anti-Ukraine war RussiansWhy Britain’s Covid outlook veers between ‘glorious sunshine and blizzards’Shock and disgust as NHS trusts still push for ‘natural births’ despite damning Ockenden reportMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather temperatures plummet 6c britain braces wintry weather","story":"The UK is braced for further wintry weather over the weekend, with frost creeping in overnight and temperatures set to plummet as low as -6C in some areas.Forecasters said the peaks and troughs of spring will hit most of the country over the next week, with sunny spells and windy intervals expected in most regions.Gardeners have been warned to keep an eye on their blooms as sub-zero temperatures expected on Saturday night could disrupt flowering.Simon Partridge, the Met Office meteorologist, said lows of -6C were likely in northern regions on Saturday night, before a slightly milder turn on Sunday.Tonight will be cold, with widespread frost across the UK.

MPs have raised alarm that people could miss out on council tax rebate or see payments delayed due to loopholes in the system.In a letter to Cabinet Minister Michael Gove this week, Levelling Up Committee chairman Clive Betts said: The Government needs to get a grip on the operation of the council tax rebate and give clear guidance to councils so that this rebate is delivered to households reliably and effectively.If the Chancellor is minded to bring forward additional support to households through the council tax system later in the year then it is even more crucial that every effort is made to create a process that works now. How does it work  People living in homes in council tax bands A to D in England will be eligible for the £ payment.

Mr Kinnock, whose South Wales constituency includes Britainaposs biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “The Government must immediately call on British companies to boycott Russian and Belorussian steel. “British companies should always seek to buy British steel as a matter of course, to support local communities and to help meet environmental targets. “But choosing to buy specically from Russia and Belarus is a gt to Vladimir Putin at a time when we should be seeking to freeze the country out of the world economy.“Worse still, it is an insult to the thousands of brave Ukrainians who have lost their lives in Putin’s barbaric war.” Community steelworkers’ union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “The scenes from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and across Ukraine remain horrying, and we need to ask ourselves how does the UK respond as a country  “Sanctions are an important tool in the resistance of Russian aggression, and the UK steel industry is more than prepared to manufacture steel domestically.  “Not only should we not be importing steel from Russia or Belarus, this further demonstrates the case that we should maintain our ability to manufacture all grades of steel in the UK.” A Government spokeswoman said: “The UK has taken swt action, including an unprecedented package of diplomatic and economic sanctions, to punish Putin for his barbaric actions in Ukraine.  “This includes introducing a % additional duty on top of existing tarf measures for ious goods from Russia and Belarus, including steel. “This will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, and ensure it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect.” The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel since the industry was rocked by plant closures and thousands of job losses in .

MPs will arrange a date for a Westminster showdown on outlawing “Stone Age” devices that can wound and kill cats and dogs.

A petition urging the Government to “prohibit the sale, use and manufacture of free-running snares” has attracted more than , signatures. The demand warns that “people setting free-running snares cannot ensure animal welfare as required” and that snares “cause unnecessary suffering to mammals, are indiscriminate and should be banned”. Downton Abbey actor and wildle activist Peter Egan said it was “bewildering to think that there are people who would oppose a ban on snares”.  He added: “They are such cruel and unpleasant contraptions. “For a country that claims to protect wildle, it is bizarre that they’re still in use at all – they cause the most tremendous and unnecessary suffering.” Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “It’s shameful that in  we’re still catching, injuring and killing animals in the most inhumane and indiscriminate way. “Parliament supported calls for a ban on snares as long as six years ago, and yet we’ve seen no concrete action.  “The Government must urgently bring an end to this horric practice by outlawing the sale, possession and use of snares immediately.” Paying tribute to the National Anti-Snaring Campaign and Hunt Investigation Team’s work on fighting for a ban, Animal Aid director Iain Green said: “We’re delighted that more than , people have signed our government petition to ban snares. “Clearly, the public want to see an end to these hideously-cruel, archaic, torture devices that trap, maim and kill millions of animals, and we will now take the campaign to ban snares to Parliament. “No animal deserves to be trapped by a wire noose and we are sure that, judging by the strength of public opinion on this matter, we will get a ban on snares.” Responding to the petition, the Government said it “recognises that some people consider snares to be an inhumane and unnecessary means of trapping wild animals and will launch a call for evidence on the use of snares”.

The enemy aircraft swung into attack formation after a plume of smoke from Stinger anti-aircraft missiles exposed the Brits’ position. The Stingers – like those now being used in Ukraine – missed. And Tony and his SAS buddies were sitting ducks. “My heart was in my mouth,” Tony reveals. “They knew where we were and there was no outrunning them. “Thoughts flashed through my mind – what were they armed with  Rockets  Cannons  Napalm ” But lady luck was on Tony’s side. As the jets flashed overhead he could see their empty missile pods – they were out of ammo, having dumped everything on Goose Green, a major battleground in the Falklands War of . Tony lived to fight another day. And he tells his incredible story – on the th anniversary of the war – in his new memoir Born For War. Tony, , tells of fierce hillside battles and despair at witnessing the deaths of  comrades when a helicopter ditched into the sea.  In a second hair-raising mission, as he advanced on an oil refinery, he lay face-down in the Falklands peat as Argentinian snipers wearing night-vision goggles fired anti-aircraft rounds at his position. Artillery shells and bullets flashed by in a thick hail of fire. When the shooting stopped he made his dash to safety. It was all in a day’s – or night’s – work. While the Argentinian air force was formidable, its army consisted largely of under-trained conscripts – no match for elite SAS soldiers. As Our Boys gained momentum, Tony joined the push towards the capital, Port Stanley. The war took him to the slopes of nearby Mount Kent where, after one victory, he claimed a grisly trophy – a blood-soaked parka which he wore for the rest of the campaign.  For a week, Tony remained holed up on the mountain as the SAS repelled a string of attacks. Some  enemy soldiers came at the British position and  were killed or wounded. “Attacking high ground is a dangerous proposition at the best of times,” Tony writes in his memoir. “Attacking the SAS on high ground is tantamount to suicide.” He recalls another le-threatening episode as British forces closed in on the capital. From the slopes of Mount Kent, his squadron conducted a daytime assault on Argentinian defenders. The SAS men were outnumbered two-to-one. Tony writes: “While keeping my eyes ahead for the enemy, I moved from one piece of cover to the next. “Perhaps I moved too quickly, because the next time I looked around I was on my own.” Argentinian conscripts, startled by the ferocity of the advancing SAS, had abandoned their trenches and fled. But Tony had run into a minefield. “Looking back down the slope, I saw that the rest of my troop had stopped. Thankfully, I found a goat track and followed this back down.” By then the war was almost over. But liberating the Falklands – British territory in the South Atlantic – had come at a price. And Tony tells of the haunting day he lost some of his closest friends.On May  – over six weeks after the war began on April  – he was on the deck of HMS Intrepid, the British vessel where he was stationed. A Sea King helicopter was on its way carrying more SAS men. It was dark and Tony recalls the chopper’s lights winking closer and closer... then disappearing. The helicopter had crashed into the sea and despite a frantic rescue effort,  men died,  from the SAS.  It was the regiment’s worst day since the Second World War. An army chaplain asked Tony to take a dead crewman’s hand as he delivered the Last Rites. “It was undoubtedly the lowest point of the war for me,” Tony says today. “It was devastating. Even now I don’t think I’ve got over it.” The -day conflict cost the lives of  British servicemen,  on the Argentine side and three civilians. The th anniversary brings back vivid memories for millions who were glued to compelling nightly TV updates on the fate of our troops. Tony, who is now a security consultant, had been in the Army for nine years when the conflict began – and the Forces were in his blood. His father was a flight engineer on a WW bomber and his grandfather and uncles served as Royal Marines.  Tony – who went on to train SAS recruits including Bravo Two Zero author Andy McNab – enlisted on his th birthday and says he was always playing soldiers as a child. He was often sent home from school in Hayes, Middlesex, for turning up for class in his Army Cadet unorm. “While I do think that it’s possible to turn people into soldiers, I believe a certain few of us are born to be warriors,” he writes. “I didn’t ever have a choice about being a soldier – it was my fate, a fate I welcomed with open arms.” He served two tours in Northern Ireland with the Royal Green Jackets – in  and  – before being “badged” into the SAS. When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared Britain was at war with Argentina, a flotilla sailed from Portsmouth to reclaim the Falklands, , miles away.  Tony said goodbye to his we Jenny and admits: “I was desperate to get my teeth into it.” He received the Queen’s Gallantry Medal for his accumulated service in Northern Ireland. After  years in the SAS, he retired from the army at . The Falklands left a lasting mark. He writes: “Today it is common for people to think of those who served in the SAS as heroes, but the only heroes in the regiment are the dead. “The rest of us are just ordinary men who were asked to do extraordinary things in extraordinary times.”Born For War is published by Welbeck and is available now.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British ArmyRoyal MarinesFalklands WarWorld War SoldiersArmed forcesThe Falklands\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the midst of a cost of living crisis, with all-time-high inflation, national insurance tax hikes and rising interest rates, many have been fearful about the beginning of this new financial year. But the start of this month also saw the enormous rise in the price cap on energy bills set by regulator OFGEM, to a record £,. The soar in cost will mean the average household will see a rise of £ per year in their gas and electric bill.  So which of the two is cheaper to run  Most central heating models use gas radiators pumping hot warmer from a boiler to heat several rooms at once. Naturally, this can prove expensive as it uses gas over a wide area for several hours a day. The alternative is to heat only the room youaposre using or need to heat with an electric appliance that works independently. Electric heating units take their power from wall sockets rather than one central system, but this isnapost necessarily cheaper upfront.  While market chaos has made it near impossible to estimate accurate electricity and gas prices, tradespeople estimate the former is more expensive, The Express reports.Data reported by checkatrade from the last time prices were stable - in December  - show gas heating costs approximately .p per kWh.Electric heating is almost four times more expensive at p per kWh. But using electricity creates savings where, such as in installation. Gas central heating systems require the hand of a specially trained tradesperson and cost up to £, on average. Electric central heating systems cost markedly less, averaging out at £,.  Heaters not hardwired to the mains usually require a single plug socket, with no electrician necessary. But there are other factors to consider when considering whether to use electric heating. One such consideration is efficiency, as gas wonapost convert to heat at a : rate. Most research shows that, at peak efficiency, gas boilers are roughly  percent effective. Electric heaters generate one unit of heat per hour of operation. In the long run, electricity can give people more bang for their buck.

However, an expert locksmith has revealed that is simply not the case and that burglars are out on the prowl whatever the weather. Elizabeth Johns also said that many Brits make a common mistake during the winter by not wanting to stand outside in the cold ripping up large cardboard boxes.  Many will leave these boxes, often which have branding of high-cost items such as TVs or games consoles, leaning against the bin - giving burglars a key indicator as to what they will find inside your home.She told the Sun : In the summer, itaposs very easy to go out to your bin and put boxes in but in the colder weather, a lot of people donapost want to go out all the way to the bins to rip boxes up to put them in the bin.So they will leave boxes out that have markers on them of high-value items. Any high-value items that come in big cardboard boxes can be quite a chore to rip up and put in the bin in the colder weather. She added that it is vital to ensure that these are hidden from burglars because it will alert them to the fact high-value items are in the property.

Stockport in Greater Manchester is currently enduring a surge of anti-social behaviour, with police issuing a warning to parents. Kids as young as nine have been up to no good in Merseyway Shopping Centre, haranguing workers and shoppers, Manchester Evening News reported. On one occasion a group of  boys and girls became embroiled in a large brawl before racing into shops and making a mess. According to shop workers things came to a head on March , when children rode their bikes around shops and launched items at each other.Have you been the victim of anti-social behaviour  Email webnews@mirrorThe incident prompted Stockport police to post a message on its Facebook page saying young people were aposrunning riotapos. Salim Patel has been working at Bhaji newsagents, just outside the entrance of Merseyway, for  years. He said that anti-social behaviour has always been an issue, but it has definitely increased in recent months. When we entered the shop and asked him about the police statement, he simply shook his head and said theyaposre causing so much trouble. They come in and ask for a vape but as soon as I ask for some ID they just start shouting abuse, Mr Patel added. A group of six will all come in at the same time with some just stealing stock, I tell them to stop what theyaposre doing but they just donapost listen. Iaposm in here on my own and need to be behind the kiosk, it can be very intimidating when thereaposs a big group.  I call for security straight away but by then itaposs already too late. You canapost say anything to themthey just donapost care. Sometimes itaposs absolutely terrible to work here. Iaposve been here  years but itaposs got so much worse recently, at the weekends there is so much trouble. I can see them stealing things but I just canapost do anything when thereaposs a big group. Sometimes kids are even coming in with their parents and stealing still, itaposs like theyaposre being encouraged too, but nobody listens. A senior sales assistant from HMV said that all the surrounding businesses were suffering, with groups running riot over recent weeks.Speak to any retailer here and theyaposll tell you the same thing, he said. You might get two or three groups all combining with crowds of at least  or so forming and looking for trouble. Last week we had someone, who could have only been nine or , ride their bike into the shop and make as much mess as they could. At the weekend there were lots of fights, all between themselves. Itaposs been a big problem recently. It can happen any day of the week too, not just weekends or school holidays when you might expect more kids around. At least two or three times a week thereaposs trouble kicking off with really young looking kids recently. Theyaposre just looking to get a rise out of someone. Itaposs like theyaposre wanting police or security to be called so they can have fun running away from it.  Itaposs been a bit better this week since the police did that post and hopefully more is done to keep on top of it. We canapost really do anything either, theyaposre just young kids. And they know that we can only really ask them to politely leave but nothing more. It seems like theyaposre doing this just because theyaposre bored, theyaposve got nothing better to do. The story was very much the same in the Ann Summers store opposite. Itaposs getting ridiculous now, one member of staff said. You can hear them coming and we have to go and stand at the store to stop them coming in. On Saturday a young kid rode in on his bike, itaposs crazy. People are always having to call security on their radio to help. If you argue with them they start throwing drinks around, itaposs become a massive problem now. Weaposve got a business to try and run but this going on just makes it a lot harder than it needs to be. You always see the same faces too. £Hopefully the police do genuinely deliver what theyaposre promising from that post, we need it.  There was a clear and large security presence around the shopping centre on a Thursday afternoon. One young man was stopped by security before trying to cycle through the Merseyway centre, with an argument starting when they were asked to leave their bike outside. One man shopping with his we, who wished not to be named, said: We used to come here every weekend for shopping or going to cafes. Itaposs okay around the market but can be terrible down here. Thereaposs always big groups around on bikes and these scooters. Police definitely need to be doing more about it. GMP Stockport have placed a lot of emphasis on parents to make sure their kids arenapost visiting the area after school and getting involved in trouble. The full statement from GMP Stockport said: Parents and s - Do you know where your kids are  Recently there has been a large increase in children aged nine to  coming to Stockport Town Centre and doing what I can only describe as running riot. I have charged my team to tackle this as it simply isnapost fair on people who are trying to go about their daily business, be that shopping, socialising, travelling, working or any other reasons. Please can I ask you all as parents, carers and s to speak to your children and make sure they are not coming to the town, after school and causing issues with their friends.

He said: The day started with a thorough tour of the site, taking a look behind the till and into the kitchen at all of the state of the art fryers, ious storage chillers and freezers, plus numerous hand washing and cleaning stations throughout. Cleanliness really stood out as one of the most important practises in the kitchen, across the day I lost track of how many times I washed my hands which is obviously so important when handling food of any kind but especially chicken. The site was incredibly impressive, the whole kitchen was modern and thoroughly clean - the true sign of a well run kitchen.  The sheer amount of appliances in use really did take me by surprise also, countless fryers, cookers, defrosters and ovens, the list goes on. I suppose as you order fast food you tend not to think of all the inidual parts necessary to craft the end result. Not only this but the sheer speed and precision of the experienced staff when using all of this equipment was very impressive. As Sam rolled up his sleeves and got his hands dirty, he described breading the chicken as an artform. He said: The first step was to get the chicken breaded, an entire artform unto itself.Once Iaposd been given a very useful demonstration it was my turn, and I have to say I was very excited. The flower was so unbelievably soft, it felt like it was working absolute wonders for my skin and great fun to work with. To make sure each fillet is up to standard you must totally cover each, then fold over a hefty amount of the flower on top in one fluid motion before repeating the process for a total of  times. They are then dipped in water and breaded once more, again repeating the previous steps  times. After getting a real hands on experience with the breading process it was time to get cooking with the help of the shiny, new fryers.With all of the fillets ready on the grills, it was frying time which was every bit as satisfying as youaposd expect it to be. Dunking them into the oil was an easy process once I got my head around the mechanics of the fryer, though it did take me a couple tries mind you. After a few short minutes they were done, with a perfect golden coating and a smell that made me instantly hungry, I was now very eager to try the fruits of my labour. All that was left to do was get my fillet burger bunned-up, a portion of chips ready on the side and a drink to wash it all down. Before I knew it, my lunch was on a tray and ready to eat, tasting all the more satisfying after both seeing and helping with the creation process.  As his day came to a close, Sam claimed he left the branch with even more respect for KFC workers than before he arrived. He said: I left my visit with much more respect for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes at KFC and all fast food chains. Itaposs easy to assume that fast food is easy to make given the name but I can assure you that your lunch time treat really does take a lot of effort from a skilled team. Definitely some food for thought to take away when your next in thought for food.

The resident said that he reported what had happened to them and that, while two contractors came to take pictures, nothing had happened six hours later. Yesterday afternoon , the residents said the stench was filling the block of flats and that they were unable to go into their kitchens as they described them as a health hazard, reports BristolLive.Resident Martin Hewer said he had also turned his electricity off as a precaution because water is pouring through the ceiling of his tenth floor flat.Iaposm absolutely fuming, Iaposm furious - itaposs a scandal, he said. I went for a walk this morning and just as I got back at around am, there was a great big bang from the kitchen and I walked in to find it like this. I talked to my neighbour who was out, and told him to come back, and his kitchen was the same. I donapost know how many flats are affected like this, but Iaposm on the tenth floor so it could be a lot of them.The council had contractors in doing something with the drains, and God knows whataposs gone wrong. I went and found them and told them, and two of them came up, had a look, took some pictures and then went off again. I havenapost seen them since. Mr Hewer, who is retired, also said heaposs waiting to hear back from the council, adding that he is worried for his health.I couldnapost believe what I saw when I walked into the kitchen. There was all this dirt everywhere, itaposs like a sticky black tar-like substance and it stinks. Obviously the kitchen is unuseable and Iaposm worried about what this substance is anditaposs safe to clear up - it needs professional cleaners because now my kitchen is contaminated with this black stuff.  It needs proper disinfecting - this is a health and safety issue, he added. Bristol City Council was contacted for comment. Bristol Live met another resident who said her flat had not been affected, although she said her sink hole was blocked with a plug.

She also advised those with hearing loss, ringing in your ears and dizziness to not dismiss these symptoms and still take a test.

The Princess and her father have been featured in evidence given to a judge overseeing a High Court financial dispute between an elderly Turkish woman and a former banker this week. The dispute is between Nebahat Isbilen, who is in her s, and has sued Selman Turk, a Turkish businessman based in London.She is reportedly suing him over £million that she says is missing, Mail Online reports.A judge overseeing the dispute has been told that the Duke of York was allegedly paid £, for assistance he provided in relation to Mrs Isbilenaposs passport.  According to records of an alleged phone call between the dukeaposs former private secretary Amanda Thirsk and Mrs Isbilenaposs private bank, the money was sent to Andrewaposs private bank account as a wedding gt for Beatrice and her now husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. Mrs Thirsk said Itaposs a gt for the wedding, a wedding gt, it was reported. Court documents reportedly show that Andrewaposs ex-we the Duchess of York was sent payments totalling £,, while his younger daughter Eugenie received £,, including a £, aposbirthday gtapos. The Duke of York is not accused of any wrongdoing and is not a central figure in the case. It is understood neither Beatrice nor Eugenie had any knowledge of their parents’ dealings with Mr Turk, thereported. Mrs Isbilen is the we of a Turkish MP jailed in their homeland on apospolitically motivatedapos charges. She had needed help moving assets out of Turkey after her husband became a political prisoner, High Court judge David Halpern was told. Mr Turk, a former banker, agreed to help. Mrs Isbilen alleges he breached fiduciary obligations he owed to her and advanced claims in deceit but Mr Turk is fighting the case, which is ongoing and has been heard in London. Mrs Isbilen said police had seized her previous passport and Mr Turk had obtained a new passport for her through connections with Turkish authorities.Mr Turk told me that he received help from the Duke of York to show or send the picture of my old passport to Turkey and that this service would normally be worth £ million, but it would cost lesswe made the payment by way of a gt, she said.

A document outlining Mrs Isbilenaposs case said the Duke had subsequently ed the £,. Judge Halpern said, in a ruling, that a lawyer representing Mrs Isbilen told him in an affidavit that information had emerged to show evidence given by Mr Turk was misleading. He said solicitor Jonathan Tickner told him evidence showed money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen,substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York. Judge Halpern said barrister Dan McCourt Fritz, who is leading Mrs Isbilenaposs legal team, told him the total sums which his client claims were misappropriated amount to million . Mr Turk has provided explanations for approximately two thirds of these sums, most of which have been allegedly spent on professional or other fees or lost in bad investments, the judge added in his ruling. No explanation at all has been given for the remaining one third.  A statement of claim drawn up by Mrs Isbilenaposs lawyers said: In or around November , Mr Turk told Mrs Isbilen that she needed to make a purported aposgtapos of £, to HRH Duke of York by way of payment for assistance that he told her HRH Duke of York had provided in relation to Mrs Isbilenaposs Turkish passport. The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gt to HRH Duke of York in connection with her passportwas , and Mr Turk made it dishonestly, knowing it to be  and intending Mrs Isbilen to rely on it.

It has also been suggested that it shows the -year-old Queen still has control over the Royal Family as she was behind Andrew’s prominent role while other senior royals disapproved.  Either way it has raised hopes for Andrew that he can have an important role for the Jubilee events to mark the Queen’s  years on the throne. It comes after he was removed from public le and paid suspected millions to settle a civil sexual assault case involving Virginia Giuffre. He has always denied any wrong-doing in the case.“Prince Andrew does want to participate in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations and to be present at the St Paul’s Cathedral service of thanksgiving and to pay tribute to the Queen’s magnicent  years of public service, a royal insider told the Express.“The Prince and Queen do have a close bond. The Queen knows exactly what she is doing. She’s very much in charge.  A packed itinerary to mark the royal milestone opens with Trooping the Colour and the Queen’s Birthday Parade, on June . Then the St Paul’s service next day is followed by a trip to one of the monarch’s favourite engagements – the Derby at Epsom.

Up until recently she still regularly went riding - enjoying her time with her horses in the fresh air. And it now appears that her great-granddaughter Princess Charlotte is following in her footsteps by reportedly also taking up the hobby alongside her brothers Prince George and Prince Louis. The three are said to have become aposavid ridersapos and are all trotting about on their very first ponies. It is believed they began to hone their riding skills at their Norfolk home Amner Hall during lockdown last year.Dad Prince William was said to be aposthrilledapos that his children are taking on the hobby after he learned how to ride as a child. The Queen has long been known for her love of horses after having her first riding lesson at the age of three. Previously, she selected eight special horses that she and her family have loved riding and watching, plus five of the most memorable racehorses of all time that she has bred and owned.

The head of state also chose the racehorse Estimate which triumphed in the Ascot Gold Cup, making her the first monarch to win the trophy. In October last year, It was reported that the Queen was told to give up horse riding for at least six months, following a bout of ill health. A royal source said at the time: “The Queen is sad she can not get out on her horse, which is one of her favourite pastimes, but she is resting and taking every precaution to get back to full fitness. However she is very determined to be back riding as soon as possible and in no way does she feel her riding days are behind her.” Itaposs unclearshe has been out riding since this.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation.

Below the cobbled and winding streets of Stockportaposs Old Town are secret cellars and bygone doorways that reflect the townaposs rich history. One expert said Stockport is filled with holes and connecting tunnels, comparing it to a rabbit warren.Stockport-born and bred Phil Catlin has deep knowledge about what is hiding below the old pubs and many new independents in Underbanks and around the Market Hall. Phil, who is also known as the Tunnel Inspector, said there are cellars upon cellars, dungeons, and old nightclubs, including where Jimi Hendrix once famously played in the s, reports the MEN. The expert discovers, investigates, and documents man-made and man-used spaces underneath Britain. With expertise in health and safety, history and archaeology, Phil has explored a large portion of the abandoned sections of the town, taking photographs along the way. And heaposs worked out why the Old Town is higgledy-piggledy in design, with dferent levels of terrain. He said:was essentially a big sandstone lump, with a church, a castle, and then they ended up with a market.It was so easy to dig, so they kept digging down and down. Everyone has cellars underneath and some units have double cellars. The Bakers Vault pub had a nightclub beneath it, and then another cellar they didnapost know was there. The grade-II listed Market Hall was erected in , but the site has housed a market dating back to the late Anglo-Saxon period, with the granting of a formal charter in .  While Phil says he isnapost aware of anything beneath it, itaposs evident that the locals dug outward from this point. The pavement slopes down to Mealhouse Brow road, and on that corner lies Stockport Dungeons - which is a tourist attraction open today. Here, the drunk and disorderly were locked up in a cell below ground. It was also where the Court Leet was held from the th until the late th century.Prisoners were held in the dungeon before being taken to the court or transferred to Chester or Lancaster Assizestheir crime was more serious. Next door to the dungeons, at what is now a barber shop, a hatch - with a secret cellar behind it - was discovered by the owners, Phil says. Further down into Underbanks, Phil explains there was once a stream there, which led to a V-shape forming in the ground, creating a valley.  It was then covered over and became part of the thoroughfare from London to Glasgow. Underneath independent business Underbank Studios, on Little Underbank, an extra doorway was discovered that led to a staircase, Phil believes, while the owners of neighbouring dry salon also found another secret room that had been covered up. The Cracked Actor pub on the same road is another that has two cellars, one on top of the other.

Thereaposs a school of make-up in one part of the building, but below it was once the home of the Sinking Ship Club - where Jimi Hendrix performed in . It was a sandstone cave, Phil said. It would get really crowded, and condensation would drip from the ceiling, it would be like sandy water.  The cobbled Royal Oak Yard road leads to a carpark, which could be mistaken for any old rundown space. Butyou take a closer look, large vaults can be found underneath that were used for storage, and caves carved into the sandstone remain. Hidden behind the gates there are air raid shelters that the Queenaposs Head Pub, which owns them, uses for storage now, Phil said. You can see old chimneys built into the sandstone too, which were used for smelting tin. Behind a garage door, my father and I found an old Victorian bottling machine, that they used in Victorian times for bottling sparkling wine.Phil also says the area was connected to the Market Place via the yard behind where the Angel Inn pub is now located. It was used as Stockportaposs first theatre and a aposhaunt of prostitutesapos lined the staircase down to Underbank. There was also a rumoured brothel, called aposthe dust holeapos, by where the old coffee warehouse was on Rowston Brow, which has a number of cellars deep into the ground. Where The Light Gets In now occupies the top floor of that building.  Not so secret are Stockportaposs official air raid shelters, located on Great Underbank, where, today, visitors can explore the network of tunnels that was carved into the natural sandstone clfs during World War II. First opened in , the shelters were the largest purpose-built civilian air raid shelters in the country, designed to provide shelter for up to , people. They were extended in - to accommodate ,. Stockport is riddled with holes and tunnels, Phil said. Itaposs like a rabbit warren.

The bug, which causes nausea and vomiting, usually sees a surge in the winter months but had been kept at bay by covid restrictions. With Brits now free to mingle more than previously, germs are spreading more easily. Care homes and schools are often the worst affected by norovirus outbreaks, which then quickly spread within families. Experts have since warned parents to act fastthey notice any symptoms and to regularly wash their hands with soap water, as hand sanitiser is ineffective at killing the virus. The UK Health Security Agency, which monitors outbreaks of the vomiting bug, has urged Brits to be vigilant as cases continue to rise. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereLesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety, UK Health Security Agency told The Sun the increased cases were due to a relaxing in covid restrictions. Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs, she added. Ms Larkin urged Brits to stay at homethey were experiencing symptoms and to avoid ing to work or sending children to nursery until at least  hours after symptoms have cleared. Those who believe they have contracted the virus are advised to keep as hydrated as possible and stay clear of elderly relatives, especially in care homes or hospitalswhile they are feeling sick. Handwashing is key to help stop the spread of this bug, but unlike for Covid- alcohol hand sanitisers do not kill off norovirus, so soap and warm water is best, Ms Larkin added.Anyone suffering from norovirus symptoms can book a phone consultationthey are concerned, but are advised not to see their GP in person. Norovirus can easily spread through contact with infected patients or contaminated surfaces, however, the virus usually passes after a couple of days. Covid restrictions also saw flu cases lower than usual during the winter months, but as restrictions have lted these too have begun to pick up. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, cases are still relatively low but have nevertheless seen an increase over her last week. Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist for the UK Health Security Agency, told The Sun the increase was likely to increased mixing in office workspaces and urged Brits to regularly wash their hands to curb the spread. He also encouraged those believing they are suffering from flu to work from home until they are feeling better, and to avoid contact with elderly relatives.

Tesco is now offering people the chance to buy a lateral flow test for just £, cheaper than a takeaway coffee, reports Birmingham Live. Healthcare firm Everything Genetic are helping supply the tests to Tesco, and the firmaposs chief executive James Price hopes the scheme can help consumers who are worried about expenses during the cost of living crisis. The healthcare firm aims to maintain test prices to less than a takeaway coffee” to provide reliable, accurate and affordable tests, Mr Price said.  He added: As the kits will now be positioned in convenient Tesco retail locations up and down the country, they’ll be readily available at a moment’s notice for anyone wanting to get tested.It comes as Covid infection levels hit a record high across the UK. Some . million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid- in the week ending March , up from . million in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said. The ONS data shows one in  people in England are estimated to have had Covid during that week, up from one in  the week before, and in Wales the figure is one in  people, up from one in .Both are record highs and it comes after experts warned that at such levels anyone in the population who can catch Covid is likely to get it.Boots and Superdrug are also selling inidual tests or packs of five to those who want them, while some groups do still have access to free asymptomatic testing. These include patient facing NHS staff, adult social care and hospice staff. A small number of care home visitors who provide personal care, some prison workers and workers in high risk domestic abuse refuges also have access to the free testing.Earlier this week, the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser for England, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned the world needs to be ready for inevitable future pandemics which look very dferent to the current one.Itaposs very obvious to everyone in this meeting that there will be a future pandemic, he said. That I think is clear. Itaposs also clear this one is not over and weaposve got very high infection rates at the moment. And the room for this virus to evolve remains very large, so we could be taken by surprise again with a iant that escapes immunity.

Stay-at-home we and mum Christina Keeler, , currently has four dolls that she loves to dress up, take on trips and photograph. Christina, from Wyalusing, Pennsylvania, USA, loves the hobby so much her husband Bill and two daughters, Grace, four, and Joy, two, join in, and the family have even launched their own YouTube channel. The mum-of-two, who admits some of her family and friends donapost like the unusual hobby, started obsessing over the dolls shortly after she lost her and Billaposs first baby in . The heartbreak cut even deeper because Christina suffers with endometriosis - a long-term condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the oies and fallopian tubes - when she was in her twenties and was told by doctors that she would not be able to conceive.  Thankfully, Christina and Bill went on to have Grace and Joy but Christina still had a longing for a newborn baby to hold, dress up and photograph. At the same time Christina watched a documentary about reborn dolls and the people who take part in the hobby of roleplaying with the hyper realistic dolls asthey are real babies and was instantly intrigued.Christina researched the hobby on Instagram and bought her first reborn doll, Hannah Hope, in January .As an adult, my husband, Bill, and I suffered the painful loss of our infant, said Christina. I found myself searching for the feeling of a newborn baby in my arms. To this day it is very dficult to speak about, it is only because of reborns that I can even talk about it at all. I remember screaming and crying out to God from the hospital bed aposI want my baby! I want my mum!apos, Christina added. I lost my mum a few years prior due to cancer, and it was at that very moment I realised my baby was now in Heaven with my mum and my arms were left empty.  Thankfully we were able to go on and have two healthy daughters, but I never could shake the feeling I had in that hospital bed yearning for my baby in my arms and being left empty handed and broken hearted. Currently Christina has a collection of four dolls of newborn roleplay age called, Isabella aposIzzyapos Sage, Isaiah Scott, Lennon aposLennyapos Levi and Princess, that she loves to dress up, snuggle with and take pictures of. Grace and Joy often take the dolls out in public to places like the supermarket where people often mistake them for real le babies. Christina says she quickly because obsessed with reborn dolls after watching a documentary about them, and eventually set up her own YouTube channel with the help of Bill so they can film box openings, roll play videos and a aposreborn news showapos. I love many aspects of the hobby - from dressing them and taking photos, snuggling them, and taking them on outings with my family, the mum said. I love that itaposs a hobby I can do together with my family - they are the most important things to me besides my faith, and to have them share in this hobby Iaposm so passionate about makes me so happy.Christina and her family share their reborn adventures on Instagram under the handle, @the_reborn_family_youtube and on YouTube where they are known as The Reborn Family. Despite her immediate family being supportive of their hobby, Christina admits that not everyone in her wider family understands reborns but she hopes by continuing with her social media channels the hobby of reborning will soon be viewed as an acceptable hobby by society. When Christina is out and about with her dolls, most people are shocked to learn that the dolls are not real babies after mistaking them for real le newborns, something which is highly amusing for the Keeler family. I have in-laws nearby that completely disapprove of my hobby and have asked Bill to not support me in it. None of my friends or family have accepted my hobby, said Christina. They find it odd and refuse to even talk about it with me. Itaposs like the big elephant in the room that we all just pretend isnapost there. Itaposs hurtful. Iaposve even had family members write rude comments on my YouTube channel.  YouTube filters most of the rude comments so itaposs rare they come on our radar, but we still do get a few comments that sneak through and arenapost the kindest. I had a distant family member comment, aposYou guys are freaks,apos I contemplated responding but decided to just delete it and carry on. I wish they would be happy for me and celebrate that I found something I enjoy. This hobby might be strange to some people, but it isnapost hurting anyone - itaposs a harmless hobby that I wish we could normalise. Thataposs my goal anyway. To normalise this hobby to be accepted by society. Christina added: I take my reborns out maybe a few times a month. I donapost always film it, but usuallywe take a reborn out we are filming for our YouTube channel. Other than the occasional whispers, we seem to get really positive feedback. If we wanted people to think it was a doll, we would make them look like dolls. People will come up to us and ask how old the baby is orthey can take a look at the baby and then we tell people itaposs a reborn doll - they are usually pretty surprised and have a good laugh and enjoy the incredible art that is so lelike. Sometimes, however, people will feel silly for thinking they are real. I feel bad because thataposs not what itaposs about. Itaposs meant to bring a smile to your face and enjoy the beauty and wonder of the art. Christina hopes that she will be able to normalise reborn dolls as a hobby and hopes to showcase the artistry that goes into creating these beautul dolls in achieving this. I understand that this hobby may seem strange at first - but take a minute and ask yourselves, aposwhy does that bother me apos, said Christina. The truth is that this is a perfectly harmless hobby where a group of predominantly womenadmire the realism of the art in ious ways such as holding them, photographing them, naming them etc. No matter what the hobby may be, as long as it isnapost harmful to yourself or others, andit brings you joy, then go for it and what others think is their problem not yours.

Lisa goes on to explainyou see your beau with someone , you might start to question who that other person is and how they know each other, which could bring out a jealous side. She said that,you continuously watch the Instagram stories of your new love, you become too invested in their le when you donapost actually know them that well yet.

For example,you dated someone in the past who was untrustworthy, you might start looking for behaviour you consider untrustworthy in a new partner through their Instagram stories. She said: Not looking [at Instagram stories] gives one the opportunity to come into dating with no agendas, preconceived notions and excitement in getting to know the inidual with a clean slate.” Lisa acknowledges her advice is easier said than done, so she also gives some advice for how to stick to your guns.

The regimentaposs commanding officer, Col Sergei Sukharev, was killed in Ukraine on  March - a major blow for any military unit.His deputy Major Sergei Krylov was killed alongside him.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere According to the BBC, in the month since the invasion began, at least  other members of the st have lost their lives in Ukraine.The men had been part of a column that advanced into Ukraine from Belarus, led by Russiaaposs airborne forces, that was tasked with capturing Kyiv. Like many other regiments they soon found themselves bogged down by intense resistance fighting and logistical dficulties. Videos circulating online show vehicles marked with VDV - the symbol for Russiaaposs airborne forces - wrecked and abandoned in villages near the capital.  While the Kremlin has not been forthcoming when it comes to announcing the deaths of its men in Ukraine, Russians have been posting tributes to fallen soldiers on social media site VaposKontakte. One has been set up Sergeant Sergei Duganov, a member of the st. Nobody knows anything, one woman wrote on it, the BBC reported. The st regiment is disappearing. Almost every day, photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. Whataposs happening  When will this end  When will people stop dying The deaths of so many members of the st will come as a blow to the Russian military, in part symbolically due to their reputation. In a video posted online last May, a general tells soldiers of the st Parachute Regiment that they are the best of the best. As well as serving in the Balkans, Chechnya and Donbas, they regularly took part in Red Square parades in Moscow. However many of their number have died, its clear that the st did not achieve their central mission of circling and then taking Kyiv.Earlier this week the Kremlin announced plans to focus the invasion effort on the east of the country in what has widely been interpreted as an acceptance that the army was stretched too thin. This morning Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that retreating Russian forces are creating “a complete disaster” by leaving mines in homes as they retreat to the east. “They are mining the whole territory, the Ukrainian president said.  They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed. There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.” Zelensky went on to urge Russian families not to let their young men sign up for the army as the Kremlin’s annual military conscription drive began. “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains, he said.  Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. Keep them at home. According to the BBC the following members of the st have died: Klim Abramov, Cpl Artem Arbuzov, Oleg Bedoshvili, CaptYurii Borisov, Snr Lt Ilya Chernyshev, Cpl Yuri Degtaryov, Konstantin Dobrynin, Sasha Dolkin, Sgt Sergei Duganov, Kiril Fedoseyev, Andrey Kovalevsky, Maj Sergei Krylov, Stanislav Kutelev, Cpl Yanosh Leonov, Sgt Alexander Limonov, Snr WO Sergei Lobachyo, Cpl Ivan Mamzurin, Cpl Ilya Martynenko, Lt Lev Ovchinnikov, Maksim Ovchinnikov, Cpl Leonid Panteleyev, Maj Oleg Patskalyev, Sgt Stanislav Petrutik, Sgt Roman Pomelov, Snr WO Pavel Rudenko, Snr Lt Alexander Shalygin, Sgt Nikolai Smirnov, Col Sergei Sukharev, Maxim Svetlenko, Snr Lt Nikolai Symov, Daniil Titov, Maxim Trokai, Ivan Turyev, Sgt Maxim Vorotyntsev, Capt Alexei Vyshegorodtsev, Alexei Yelimov, Cpl Artem Yergin, Sgt Ravshan Zhakbaev, Cpl Danila Zudkov.

The -year-old is now convinced the German paedophile took the three-year-old British girl in May  at Praia da Luz on the Algarve. And Post claimed Brueckner boasted of burgling holiday flats during chilling “night-crawls” across the Portuguese resort. He told how the chief suspect in Madeleine’s disappearance had up to  passports from ­properties he raided. And he admitted he regrets not tipping off police about his crimes, but insisted he is willing to try to help bring him to justice over the missing toddler.German Post, a talented musician and IT expert, became friends with Brueckner, , after the pair met in an Algarve bar in the early-s. He initially believed his fellow ­countryman could not have been behind Madeleine’s kidnap and thought his criminality was limited to burglary. But since discovering Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences in his teens, Post said it was now “so obvious” he snatched her. He added: “Now I know about his paedophile past, his rapist past. I’m % certain it was him. “I think he found her by chance and just took her on the spur of the moment. “I think once you are a paedophile, there is a switch in your brain that cannot be turned off. If he saw a little girl asleep, alone in her apartment, he would definitely have taken her. “Thinking about what he has done in the past makes me sick, it makes me want to vomit knowing I was hanging with him. If he is convicted of taking Madeleine I hope they lock him up and take away the key.”Post was tracked down by the Mirror to a small town in southern Cambodia where he lives under an assumed name. In his first ever interview he told how he and Brueckner would go to each other’s flats after they became friends. Post said he knew his new pal was on the “fringes” of crime but had no idea of the true scale until a later visit to his ramshackle farmhouse. He said: “I was sat in the living room and noticed piles of passports on the fireplace. There honestly must have been between  and  of them, neatly stacked up in three piles. “He told me he got them on his ‘­night-crawls’ in Praia da Luz, climbing onto balconies and through windows. It shows how many burglaries he must have done. “He said he would go into rooms and take what he wanted. At the time I guessed he was talking about cash, jewellery, ­passports… but now who knows  “He would only do it at night, it was too risky being seen in the daylight.  “He also said he was trafficking a bit of weed to make cash. But there was absolutely no sign he was into children or anything like sexual crimes. “Do I have regrets not telling the police about the passports at the time  I guess I do. “But now I’m willing to go back to court, to face him again, and help convict himthey want me to.” Post only discovered Brueckner had been convicted of child sex offences after reading about them in the press. And we can reveal he has twice been interviewed by detectives investigating the suspect and Madeleine’s case. Post also gave evidence against him at his  trial for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in , for which he is serving seven years in Germany. He fell out with Brueckner in  after the crook asked him to go to his house and clear out anything ­incriminating while he was in a Portimao prison for stealing petrol.  Post found some porn films and binned them rather than take them to a friend’s house who had children. He said: “He thought I was stealing from him or something.” The pair met briefly again in  after Post had ed to Germany to work on a Christmas market in Solingen near Dusseldorf. But after moving to Cambodia in , he was stunned when his brother rang three years later to say German detectives wanted to speak to him. Post added: “They said he was a suspect in the Madeleine case. I was absolutely shocked.” He said he had never spoken about Brueckner publicly before over fears he would be linked to the Madeleine case. And he insisted he had nothing to do with any of the suspect’s crimes. German prosecutors named Brueckner as a suspect in June  and claim to have evidence he abducted and killed her. He denies any involvement in the case. Madeleine’s parents Kate, , and Gerry, , from Rothley, Leics, continue to believe she is alive somewhere. Last week it was reported Home Office funding for Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange investigation into the disappearance will end this year. The probe, opened in , has so far cost more than £million.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

MWh mega-battery system mounted on an articulated electric lorry.The battery would plug into specially-constructed charging points connected to dedicated wind turbines, with charging taking  hours.Fully-loaded, the mobile unit would travel to designated points around Argyll and Bute, allowing up to  cars to charge at any time, and around  in total before heading back for a top-up.Requiring simply a flatbed trailer, the transportation of the mega-battery is interesting Argyll hauliers, with some larger operators looking into purchasing electric tractor units specically for this job.With wind energy on tap # much of the time, at least # and locally produced, charging costs are expected to be signicantly lower than existing methods.A spokesperson for Argyll and Bute Council said: #The basic idea is that this simplies the charging process and broadens our options.#It will allow the council to better utilise electric vehicles, providing cost savings while saving the planet.#For residents and visitors, it will make planning journeys so much easier and stress-free, rather than wondering how far you will get before your battery runs out.#The rota for Flying Sparks has clearly yet to be finalised # though we expect it to very much utilise the same sites as mobile post offices and banks around the region.#A number of firms operating Argyll wind farms have expressed an interest, and a pilot scheme is expected to be in place by April , .Esisteinwitz Gesellschaft chief executive Olaf Prilo sees huge potential for the scheme. #You have wind to spare,# he said, #so why not use this directly, rather than sending electricity to the grid. Just roll up to the turbine, plug in and charge up the battery.#His firm is currently researching the development of the necessary equipment to enable clean, renewable energy to be utilised in vehicle charging.Mr Prilo concluded: #There is absolutely no reason why the Argyll and Bute region could not become the Saudi Arabia of electricity.#"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert harbour open day hailed a success","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority say they are #delighted# with the success of a recent community day to discuss proposed improvements to Tarbert.More than  people attended the community day, held at the Templar Arts and Leisure Centre on March , to learn about and discuss early thoughts on plans to improve the range of opportunities, services and facilities available to Tarbert residents and visitors.Towards the end of  Tarbert Harbour Authority secured funding of £, through the UK Government#s Communities Renewal Fund as part of the Levelling Up agenda.This allowed the authority to appoint consultants who, over six months, will investigate and develop several major projects throughout the harbour and Tarbert village.After the design phase the projects will be taken to a further funding stage, the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, andsuccessful work will start on projects to transform and rejuvenate the village, harbour and its environs.The project team includes Leith-based John Renshaw Architects Mott MacDonald, an international civil and marine engineering consultancy and ruralDimensions a Callander-based tourism consultancy.Team members were on hand on March  to discuss concepts in detail and to discuss pros and cons, having prepared a presentation on  potential initiatives including re-organisation of the Fish Quay, creating more public paths and developing the existing boatyard.Everyone who visited was encouraged to fill in an exit questionnaire highlighting what they liked, what concerned them and to highlight alternative opportunities.Duncan Cunningham, chair of the board of trustees of Tarbert Harbour Authority, said: #We are delighted that people have taken the time to come and see initial thoughts and ideas on how the harbour and village could develop.#As with all these consultations, there are strong views on what is and isn#t appropriate.#We were delighted to get a range of other interesting ideas that we will now consider.#The next step is for the team to reflect on the feedback we have received and to build this thinking into plans. We will hold a follow-up session in May and present back updated thoughts.##If anyone would still like to comment on the initial proposals, they can get a form from the Tarbert Harbour office.

established in the region to deal with a range of low level anti-social behaviour, including dog fouling, parking and minor crimes.At the time, the £, annual cost to local tax payers was felt necessary because of a lack of regular officers patrolling the area.The CAT provided the option of deploying dedicated officers in a high profile way to tackle issues impacting on communities.But despite what Mr McAteer calls “limited success” in  Scottish Borders Council decided to double the numbers of the CAT at an increased cost to the tax payer of £,.Mr McAteer, a former detective chief

forcing many to fund their own systems.“Recent statistics, disclosed at a private council meeting, supported evidence that little material change has taken place and consequently the continued support for the CAT cannot be justied.”Mr McAteer said his views were not a criticism of the officers in the team who “have tried their best despite challenging operational pressures”.He added: “I do believe

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Now the Bingo shops are open from  in the morning and you can imagine the type they bring into the place – busloads of people and the experience of the residents has been disgusting.

My eyes lit up and I was already thinking that was cool.“We stayed in touch and it got to the stage where we thought maybe we should pursue this. We hit him up and askedhe would be up for doing the album and we worked it out and are going over there to do it.“We cannot wait.”Logan’s Close, who headlined the Dunbar Music Festival last year, created the Crowdfunder page in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the cost of the album.People can make a donation of anywhere between £ and £, in exchange for a range of incentives, including a digital download of the finished album and a live concert.The band are working alongside Creative Scotland’s Crowdmatch programme, where the national body match-funds initiatives as the band reach funding milestones.Already, more than £, has been raised.Former Dunbar Grammar School pupil Carl described the sum raised as “unreal”.He said: “We have not been up to much in such a long time [due to the pandemic].“It is nice to think that after two years, people are still supporting us.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseMost ReadArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Sam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestBiden says submarine he commissioned will enhance US securitySteven Gerrard warns Aston Villa players are fighting for their futuresGraham Potter praises reaction of Brighton fans to Neal Maupay’s missed chancesThomas Tuchel refuses to ‘make drama’ out of Cha capitulation to BrentfordPep Guardiola urges Manchester City to thrive under pressure from Liverpool,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryAmy CochraneTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailElection posters are on almost every lamppost on every corner of our towns and cities ahead of the big vote.Faces of the men and women hoping to take a seat at Stormont after May  stare down at us almost everywhere we go.But how effective are these posters as a form of advertising for would-be MLAs Some have argued they are a great way of showcasing the names and faces of candidates entering the election race, but others fear they are old-fashioned, crude and bad for the environment, with some placards also being stolen and placed on bonfires.Realistically, the only way to banish posters altogether isevery party agrees, but in Northern Ireland, consensus is a hard thing to achieve.According to PR expert Tom Kelly, posters and billboards are better at selling ideas here than in England, parts which have moved to more digital forms of canvassing.Mr Kelly, who has worked in PR for  years but also dabbled in politics as the former vice-chairman of the SDLP, told the Belfastposters could be a powerful advertising tool, even beyond facial and name recognition.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “There is a certain physical aspect to a poster or a billboard compared to just seeing the candidates’ faces on social media,” he said.“Not everyone can get to every constituent’s door, so [posters] a good way to get your face out there.“There’s also an element of competition between candidates where you may go to an area to canvas and you see your opponent’s name and face. “It makes you uneasy, and candidates really do get obsessed about how many posters they have up compared to others, so you’d be a brave man or woman to decide not to put them up. In reality, I would like to see none, but we aren’t quite there yet.”Mr Kelly used the Brexit referendum as an example of canvassing where posters and billboards influenced an outcome.“I remember crossing England in  and seeing the big Leave campaign billboard on the motorway from Manchester to Leeds,” he said. “You couldn’t not see it, and you started to notice they had a real presence.“Everyone remembers the big red bus that promised £m a week for the NHS. It may have been a lie, but it worked.“The Remain campaign, however, ignored those traditional forms of canvassing and instead focused solely on digital, whereas Leave did a bit of both.”While the PR expert sees merit in posters, they must be strategically placed.“I think most people would not want posters in their back yard but instead on main arterial routes in and out of towns and cities,” he said. “They could be a bit more effective in these areas, so as not to swamp residential areas.“For urban areas, billboards can be really effective, or a bus, whereas posters work better in rural areas.”Former Alliance party executive director Gerry Lynch believes that the colour, typeface and font of a poster can also have an impact.Mr Lynch, who was heavily involved in poster design and campaign tactics throughout his time in politics, explained: “Graphic designers have a very important job in elections that many don’t know.“Generally, Sinn Fein and Alliance would have the name of the party more prominent in the poster, and in some cases use posters with slogan words only and no photograph.“Unionist parties focus more on colour — reds and blues, which project strength — where they compete on which candidate can deliver the strongest for unionist interests.“It can come down to so many small details, even the fringing or shadowing on the image. “Graphic designers are able to express visual identity in a way most people don’t know. Even voters don’t know.”Mr Lynch, who was involved in the Alliance party for  years but is now a CoE priest based in England, said that in some areas across the water, particularly in southern counties, councils did not allow election posters in public spaces, with the tradition dying out over the years.“It’s a bit of a mix of digital canvassing and door-to-door, finding out where their supporters are and stopping voters from wavering to opponents,” he added.“While I don’t think posters with people’s heads on them make much of a dference on the campaign trail, Northern Ireland isn’t quite at the point yet where they can stop.“It requires everyone to stop — and everyone to agree.“I think a physical presence still matters, and the most impactful poster is one that resembles one of an advertising agency, more leaning towards a slogan than someone’s face.”The SDLP’s Colin McGrath has been involved in politics for almost two decades, being elected to his local council in  and becoming an MLA in . Next month’s election will be his sixth, and he believes that all posters should be banned.“They can be unsightly and many people don’t want to see them,” he said.“They’re also terrible for the environment, a waste of cardboard and plastic ties, but there is unfortunately an element of competition, which is the main motivator.“You see who has the most up where, and as soon as one puts theirs up, the others are at a disadvantage.“It can become white noise after a period of time, butyou’re a first-time candidate, you want to be part of the white noise everyone  is a part of. For things to change, it would need legislation.”Mr McGrath said posters mainly benefited new candidates but added that local media often played a bigger role.“Nine times out of , people say they recognise me from the local papers — the Mourne Observer or the Down Recorder — or sometimes social media and TV,” he explained. “Rarely do you win the election in the four or five weeks leading up to it. “People get to know you over the better part of a year or more.”TUV leader Jim Allister, however, believes that posters are “very much part of the fabric of an election”.The upcoming election will be Mr Allister’s fourth, after first being elected into the Assembly in .“Posters do serve a purpose, I believe, and an educational purpose as it shows voters who the relevant candidates are,” he told this newspaper.“They can also be a bit of a morale booster, in a sense, for each respective party.“They are very much part of the scenery of elections in Northern Ireland, and traditionally it has always happened.“There are occasions where you may see too many, but I don’t think that anyone here is going to give up on posters anytime soon.”Related topicsSDLPAlliance PartyJim AllisterSinn FéinColin McGrathTraditional Unionist VoiceMore On SDLP PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slursAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesMost ReadArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Sam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestBiden says submarine he commissioned will enhance US securitySteven Gerrard warns Aston Villa players are fighting for their futuresGraham Potter praises reaction of Brighton fans to Neal Maupay’s missed chancesThomas Tuchel refuses to ‘make drama’ out of Cha capitulation to BrentfordPep Guardiola urges Manchester City to thrive under pressure from Liverpool,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border pollAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyMost ReadArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Sam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismLatestBiden says submarine he commissioned will enhance US securitySteven Gerrard warns Aston Villa players are fighting for their futuresGraham Potter praises reaction of Brighton fans to Neal Maupay’s missed chancesThomas Tuchel refuses to ‘make drama’ out of Cha capitulation to BrentfordPep Guardiola urges Manchester City to thrive under pressure from Liverpool,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineSacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Sam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayAnalysis: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont postLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestSteven Gerrard warns Aston Villa players are fighting for their futuresGraham Potter praises reaction of Brighton fans to Neal Maupay’s missed chancesThomas Tuchel refuses to ‘make drama’ out of Cha capitulation to BrentfordPep Guardiola urges Manchester City to thrive under pressure from LiverpoolProtesters urge Government to pass rising energy prices on to providers,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In the meantime, we want to see  army personnel called out, just for Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, for the next eight weeks.They will help do the frisking at the security points and it will enable the airport to open all of the x-ray scanner machines in both Terminal  and Terminal  and keep the queues down,” he said.We need that combination of a dramatic recruitment drive by the DAA, we need the army in there at weekends and it’s reasonably small numbers –  army personnel would allow the DAA open up all the security things.”A DAA spokesman said the busiest time at the airport on Saturdays are between am and am when the first wave of departures takes place.He said the queues peaked just before am this morning when it was taking a maximum of  minutes to get through security. It was a busy first wave. Nobody missed a flight as a result of queuing for security,” he added.He said passengers were heeding the advice to allow more time at the airport and airlines were also opening their check-in desks earlier than usual which was helping to keep people moving.He said the airport will be busy again this afternoon and at around tea-time and urged passengers to be aware that it will be busy at peak periods.We’re doing all we can to alleviate delays for passengers, however, anyone travelling through Dublin Airport over the coming days and weeks should be aware that it might be very busy at peak periods.Our advice to passengers is to allow plenty of time. At peak times, this can mean up to three and a half hours before departure time. If parking a car, allow a further  minutes.Dublin Airport#s customer service team is working tirelessly with customers who have missed flights in recent days.Where security delays are found to have been the cause of a missed flight, DAA is issuing refunds to passengers. This process is ongoing and we ask affected passengers to bear with us over the coming days as we work through the ious claims,” he added.Read MoreTransport minister to hold daily crisis meetings over Dublin Airport queuesMost ReadArmagh joyrider who killed three people while making Snapchat videos and speeding at mph fails in bid to have jail time cutRoy Reynolds murder suspect ‘asked mum’s ex for hedge clippers and sheeting at am’Sacked PSNI officer guilty of ‘brutal attacks’ on his dogs narrowly avoids jailSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineTop VideosPlayBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice attend the scene of a serious RTC on the Springfield Road in west BelfastLatest Republic of IrelandBroadcaster Charlie Bird reaches mountain top in ‘inspirational’ charity climbDriver killed in overnight crash in TipperaryTaoiseach gives terror threats short shrt during low-key trip across borderBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysTransport minister to hold daily crisis meetings over Dublin Airport queuesLatestIt takes time – Rory Burns puts Ashes heartbreak to bed before new Surrey seasonDuke of York takes to ex-we’s Instagram account to reflect on Falklands WarGrammys to feature segment about the war in UkraineSir Elton John credits Ryan White’s family with saving his leMan City reclaim top spot with Burnley win after Liverpool down Watford,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead

dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people. Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

Some of the sites are fairly obvious mdash like former synagogues in Belfast mdash but others mdash like Shrigley mdash will come as a surprise to many, even in the Jewish community.ldquoThanks to the work of Chris and others the remarkable contribution made by the Utitz family and fellow refugees to the people of Shrigley will not be forgotten.Led by the Utitz and Weiniger families, they set up United Chrome Tanners, a highly successful leather tannery, and a series of associated businesses.Among the names recorded are the Utitz brothers, Alfred and Jacob, and their son Erik.Other refugees connected with the business were Walter Weiniger from Austria, who opened Marybag factories in Killyleagh and Belfast which finished handbags, and the first managing director of United Chrome Tanners, Mr Horenovsky.The Jewish families were welcomed with open arms in Shrigley. Villagers had suffered from the awful impact of the Hungry Thirties in one of the most socially deprived regions of the UK after the closure of the village spinning mill in .By November  United Chrome Tanners were employing  people tanning sheep skins and cattle hides for shoes, handbags and clothing.Within less than  years they were a world leader, employing more than  people and under the leadership of Erik Utitz became the first NI winners of the Queens award for exports.Leather tanning eventually died out in the village in .Details of the Jewish project, which received funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, can be found at this website: www.belfastjewishheritage.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Lawyer eyeing SDLP result in Strangford  ","story":"CONOR Houston is hoping to become Strangfordrsquos first SDLP Assemblyman when voters go to the polls on May .A lawyer and civic activist, he is going head-to-head against the DUP, UUP and Alliance who currently hold the constituencyrsquos five seats and as the parties ramp up their respective election campaigns, Mr Houston has outlined why he decided to put his name forward.He said he has been very fortunate to have had a lot of great opportunities throughout his career and wants to bring the experiences he has to make a positive impact on the people in Strangford.Mr Houston said while he has never been in politics before, there have been a few moments in his career that he believes shaped him for political le.ldquoAs a lawyer, I fought against unfairness and injustice, he continued. ldquoOne of the most frustrating things was seeing young people end up in the criminal justice system.ldquoSo many of them came from situations of poverty, abuse, addiction and been failed by our education and care systems.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

It has also generated an estimated £ million for the Northern Ireland Economy in that period.By a benign coincidence it was announced on Thursday that this summer a record  cruise ships will dock in Belfast bringing a much welcomed post-Covid wave of mass tourist spending across the Province.The waters through which the Titanic was launched and that HMS Caroline sped through to fight that decisive naval battle were in the th century the pathway circuits by which Belfast’s industrial revolution was turbocharged. In the st century these circuits are flowing back in the opposite direction, pulling millions upon millions of tourist-driven pounds into Northern Ireland’s economic heart, boosting expenditure and creating jobs after the devastation of the Pandemic. The city’s sea faring tradition both naval and merchant over the centuries is not only one to be proud of but also to take hope from. Belfast rose up around its lough and the Lagan. The news about Titanic Belfast’s first outstanding decade, the cruise ships , the salvation of HMS Caroline remind us of the regenerative power of the city’s waterway to the world.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But when it comes to casting their ballots, up to % of people who go have hitherto gone to the polls in NI elections have voted for political parties who are primarily identied by their stance on the constitutional question.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Even in recent elections the non-aligned centre ground, despite having surged , are doing well to get more than % of the votes.Do not be fooled by anyone who says that the protocol is only of importance to unionists, and that even many unionists do not care. Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘TUV - No Sea Border’ given approval for ballot papersLough Neagh is shrinking and could be gone by ‘SF wants to sleepwalk other parties into border poll plan’Ramadan : What is Ramadan  Ramadan dates  - and how to wish someone a happy Ramadan Ben Lowry: Three things to watch out for in the coming Stormont electionMost PopularRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and BirminghamBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, AcaiBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineeringAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s how to buy online, and how much it costs                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Provision of Covid tests by government are changing.However free testing will persist in NI for some time yet subject, to some changes. Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt seems over the years, Barry Island seems to be the shining light of identity for the Barry and District.However, many times have I been asked this, \"Karl-James Langford, was Barry Island ever an island \"Well, I could ignore the question and reply in a sarcastic way, but one, never does. For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Energy infrastructure projects take years or even decades, and our industry is used to thinking on those timescales.“We believe that, where energy is concerned, policymakers of all parties and countries must start doing the same.”OEUK wants government regulators to prioritise decisions on new oil and gas fields, but also says the UK should work with other European nations to co-operate on energy supplies.To help achieve the UK’s goal of reaching net zero by , Ms Michie said legislation should be introduced to expand the production of hydrogen and also to increase carbon capture facilities.Work is also needed to electry both the North Sea and the Irish Sea, OEUK said, calling for grids of undersea electrical cables to be installed to take power from offshore wind farms to towns and cities across the UK.Ms Michie said: “Our short-term energy security and our longer-term need for secure, net zero energy will only happenour policymakers can collectively create the right environment for long-term investment across all forms of energy production..remove“To achieve that we need stable, long-term regulatory policies, clear and predictable fiscal policies, that are supported by political alignment across all the countries and parties of the UK.“We need our policymakers and politicians to think long-term, act short-term and, above all, work together for the whole UK.”A spokesman for the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We recognise there is a lot of interest in our plans to further bolster the UK’s energy security and it is vital that we get this right.“Work continues to take place across government and industry to ensure our energy security strategy fully delivers on our aims to supercharge our renewable energy and nuclear capacity as well as supporting our North Sea oil and gas industry.“We will set out full details soon.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: North Sea can provide  usecure, safe energy u for next  years  u industry chief article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers. As for those dogs on the front and back covers  Surely it’s worth the £. sale price to find out!

We told you that the tree used to make ballot paper – Flora Plio – was in short supply. Of course there’s no such thing as a Flora Plio, which is an anagram of April Fool. Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added. An official statement on the matter is due to be made at midday today .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaceeeecaaedcf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddfaccbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
