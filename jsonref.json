They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor. Bill Evans and his wife got up at 4am to watch the ceremony of a woman he now knows as a relatives\u0027My grandfather\u0027s nickname was Happy because he was a joyful person and wherever he traveled he made people happy. He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link.

The Tunisian coastguard is pictured on patrol off the northern town of Bizerte in MayThe latest death toll was published around 7pm, after the search and rescue operation had ended for the day.The hunt for survivors would continue on Monday morning, Mohammed Salah Sagaama from Sfax\u0027s naval base told AFP.Tunisians and migrants regularly try to cross the Mediterranean to seek a better future in Europe, with 120 mainly Tunisians rescued by their navy in March after trying to reach Italy.In October, a collision between a migrant boat and a Tunisian military ship left at least 44 dead, in what Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called a \u0027national disaster\u0027.The latest shipwreck is the most deadly in the Mediterranean since February 2 when 90 people drowned off the coast of Libya, according to the IOM.Across the Mediterranean, nine Syrians including seven children drowned when their vessel sank off the coast of Turkey.The group were travelling in a speedboat intending to head illegally to Europe, when the boat hit trouble off the coast of the southern Antalya province, state media reports said.  Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE2777800000578-0-image-a-54_1528057464925.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr pictured outside Utah home looking disheveled","story":"    Roseanne Barr was pictured looking disheveled outside her Salt Lake City, Utah home on Sunday afternoon   The disgraced television star has rarely been seen since she was fired for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett on Tuesday Wolf was less than impressed that the network swiftly fired Barr after she called Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027Everyone\u0027s been saying it\u0027s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on air in the first place,\u0027 Wolf said on her Netflix show The Break.\u0027So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they\u0027ve been openly racist for the thousandth time.\u0027The \u0027lady Hitler chef\u0027 nickname references a controversial 2009 photo shoot in which Barr dressed up as a Nazi baking cookies shaped like humans.

The house has a well-appointed conservatory with a host of different plants and flowers on show          Inside there is a spacious kitchen with an enormous wine cellar in the basement of the property          Outside there are immaculate landscaped gardens and a large duck pond just across the driveway"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/08/4CE404FD00000578-5802107-The_scene_was_filmed_at_sunset_giving_the_crew_just_a_three_minu-a-10_1528099167051.jpg","title":"Tom Cruise shares scenes footage actual HALO jump","story":"    Cruise jumped from a military transport plane at 25,000 feet for the risky HALO stunt          The scene was filmed at sunset, giving the crew just a three minute window each filming day          The scene was filmed by a cameraman (foreground) wearing a head-mounted camera who jumped a few feet before Cruise (rear), making it crucial to avoid a mid-air collision          Cruise had to position himself right in front of the cameraman to get the footage for the filmRisky business!

A series of expert reports today showed how flammable cladding and muddled fire safety plans exacerbated the impact of the blaze          The report found there were a number of electrical appliances around the fridge which may have sparked the blaze  Officials said the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 the fridge-freezer, but could not be sure whether a fault with the device was the cause of the fire or whether it started in another of the kitchen\u0027s many electrical items          A photo taken during the investigation shows an electrical cooking device between the fridge freezer and the window  The report quotes a statement from one of the flat\u0027s three residents, Behailu Kebede. He raised the alarm after being woken by a fire alarm and finding smoke in his kitchenThe recording was played after the publication of a damning report found the cladding put on the outside of the building did not comply \u0027with recommended fire performance\u0027 and criticised the \u0027stay-put\u0027 policy which encouraged residents to remain in their flats in the event of the fire.Fire-safety engineer Barbara Lane said the fire service\u0027s  policy had \u0027effectively failed\u0027 barely a half-hour after the fire started, but residents weren\u0027t told to evacuate for more than an hour after that.The cladding meant the fire spread up seven storeys within seven minutes,  with 70 flats ablaze in under two hours. The disaster was compounded by non-compliant fire doors, combustible window fittings and a faulty firefighting lift. Ms Lane said that a renovation of the building completed in 2016 installed flammable  cladding on the tower\u0027s facade which led to \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this article\u0027The assembly failed adequately to resist the spread of fire\u0027 to an extent that would have support a \u0027stay put\u0027 policy, she said.Ms Lane said there had been \u0027a culture of non-compliance\u0027 with safety regulations, and identified multiple failures.The \u0027stay put\u0027 guidance which was given to residents before the fire was eventually abandoned at 2.47am - around two hours after the fire started.Ms Lane\u0027s report said it is unclear why there was such a gap between the advice being rendered redundant and the fire service changing tack, the report said.\u0027I am particularly concerned by the delay from 2.06am, when a major incident was declared, to 2.47am,\u0027 Dr Lane continued.           A photo of the flat once the debris had been cleared away shows how the other electrical items added to the damage done          Burn marks show the area beneath where the fridge-freezer stood. The skirting board behind the appliance had burned away          The fire started in the kitchen of the two-bedroom flat. The kitchen had sliding doors which opened onto the living room, pictured, where one of the flat\u0027s three occupants lived          The floor of flat 16\u0027s kitchen was strewn with wreckage of kitchen appliances when investigators got inside. The partition where sliding doors had led to the living room was almost completely burned away          Three people lived in the flat at the time of blaze. Two women had a bedroom each and a man lived in the living room  A picture taken through the front door of the flat (left) shows limited damage to the entrance hallway. As firefighters moved towards the kitchen however, the fire was much more intense, scorching the hallway leading to the kitchen (right)          Grainy images taken from body cameras worn by firefighters show the moment they opened to door to the kitchen fire          The plan show the flat. The fire started in the south-east corner, the bottom right of the image          An estimated picture of the layout of the kitchen shows a number of appliances around the freezer where the blaze started          A plan of the fourth floor shows there were five other flats on that storey of the building. Flat 16 resident Mr Kebede said he woke neigbours after discovering the blazeBut University of Dundee Professor Niamh Daeid wrote: \u0027On the basis of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the area of origin of the fire was in, or around, the tall fridge freezer in the southeast part of the kitchen.\u0027The cause of the fire remains undetermined although, based on the available information, it is more likely than not to be an accidental cause rather than a deliberate act.\u0027The originating fire within flat 16 extended out of the kitchen window of the flat and at some point re-entered through the window of the bedroom next to the living room of flat 16 causing further damage to the flat.\u0027 In a departure from information given by the Met Police, another expert said there was \u0027insufficient evidence\u0027 that the fire was started by the fridge-freezer.In another separate report, Professor Luke Bisby, from the University of Edinburgh, wrote: \u0027Some evidence exists to support a hypothesis that the fire started in the south-east side of the kitchen and in the general area of the Hotpoint FF175P fridge-freezer, however, there is currently insufficient evidence, even based on a balance of probabilities, in my opinion, to support the hypothesis that the fire originated in the fridge-freezer, and to exclude all other potential sources of ignition.\u0027With regard to other possible sources of ignition, I have not seen sufficiently convincing evidence to confidently identify the origin of the initial fire.\u0027 Shocking footage shows how a fire which started in a kitchen of a Grenfell Tower flat leapt up the side of the building. The left hand image is timed at 1.08am, not long after the blaze began. By 1.12am the fire had already started to growIn clips estimated to have been filmed between 1.16 and 1.20am, burning debris could be seen falling from the tower, and screaming could be heard.\u0027I told you, I told you get out,\u0027 one man could be heard shouting in a further clip.Six clips showing the side of the tower as it became engulfed with flames were shown side by side.\u0027Oh my god,\u0027 one woman said as huge pieces of fiery debris rained down from the blazing tower.Another could be heard sobbing as it became apparent the fire was out of control.After the video was shown, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said: \u0027It is truly shocking, every time you see it, it strikes you in a very similar way, very strongly.\u0027   This image, timed at 1.15 am, shows how, helped by flammable cladding and window materials, the fire began to grow  By 1:24am (left), the flames were burning through flats on multiple floors. An image taken from footage filmed around 1.28am (right) shows how, aided by what a report called \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027, the fire reached the top                                                      More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did nothing and a shambolic \u0027stay put\u0027 policy: Litany of Grenfell safety failings that led to a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027           \u0027Stay put\u0027 advice to Grenfell Tower residents from the emergency services that was in place for almost two hours after the fire began was a \u0027total failure\u0027 according to an expert witness. Pictured are ambulance teams at the scene of the blazeDeadly doors and cladding coupled with advice to victims stay in their flats as Grenfell Tower was engulfed by fire caused a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027, the inquiry into Britain\u0027s worst blaze in living memory revealed today.Expert witness Dr Barbara Lane decried the \u0027stay put\u0027 advice given by the emergency services to residents trapped in the burning building as a \u0027total failure\u0027 and \u0027substantially to blame for the tragedy\u0027.Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed it took one hour and 11 minutes for the authorities to change their minds and start an evacuation.But by then there was little hope of escaping the tower, which was engulfed in flames in just 20 minutes.Dr Lane also spoke of a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 at Grenfell, which had there were more than 100 non-compliant fire doors, a firefighting lift that didn\u0027t work and a tinderbox cladding system and draughty windows that accelerated the blaze. Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed that it took one hour and 11 minutes between when it became clear the safety advice had failed and when it officially changed to tell residents to leave.The advice from the emergency services was in place for almost two hours and was repeatedly told to those inside ringing 999 for help.Dr Lane wrote in her report that this failure \u0027would have materially affected the ability or willingness of occupants to escape independently through this space to the stair\u0027.It would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.          \u0027Non compliant\u0027 fire doors were also blamed for the spread of the flames while firefighters \u0027may have contributed\u0027 by leaving doors openIn 2011, the Tenant Management Organisation - which ran the building - replaced 106 flat entrance fire doors. None of the doors on any of the 120 flats - including the 14 not replaced - were compliant with the fire test evidence relied upon at the time of installation, Dr Lane found.These shortcomings would have had a number of consequences, including failure to prevent the spread of smoke and flame by leakage through gaps between the door leaf and door frame.Another failure of an \u0027unknown number of doors\u0027 to self-close after an occupant escaped would have allowed \u0027immediate\u0027 spread of fire and smoke.  A table from the report on the spread of the blaze shows how quickly the number of flat affected rose The lobbies could therefore not be used as a \u0027safe air environment\u0027 by the fire service bridgehead, forcing it to remain below level 4 until 7.30am.\u0027This greatly reduced the time available using breathing apparatus, and so the time available for rescue on the upper floors, and particularly above Level 15.\u0027Firefighters may also have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, Dr Lane found.She wrote: \u0027I have identified the fact that the firefighting operations in response to the multi-storey fire may have contributed to the failure of the stair fire doors to prevent fire and smoke spread.\u0027Current evidence indicates some of the stair doors were ajar as firefighting hoses were running from the stair into the lobby. However, I currently do not know the number of doors involved, nor which specific doors, nor for how long this opening may have occurred. I cannot yet conclude whether this made a significant contribution.\u0027In one case, a fire door to the stairwell was held open by a body, the report said.The expert\u0027s evidence also blamed the building\u0027s windows for allowing the fire to spread to the combustible cladding, which led to its rapid spread up the tower.She said the window frames were not protected with fire resistant barriers but instead with \u0027combustible materials\u0027 allowing the blaze to expand unchecked.

The cladding on the outside of Grenfell Tower was to blame for the fire spreadingAnother expert, Professor Luke Bisby, found a series of problems with refurbishment work carried out on Grenfell before the fire.Prof Bisby said the main reason the fire spread was the polyethylene-filled ACM rainscreen in the cladding.He also said combustible insulation, the presence of cavities and the use of combustible window frames added to the spread of the blaze.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this articleProf Bishby also identified the lack of cavity barriers between sections of the cladding, a \u0027crown detail\u0027 which helped the fire spread sideways and exposed parts of the combustible core added to the fire.In her report meanwhile, Dr Lane found there was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.She wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027        A detail from a report shows the cladding on the building which helped the fire spreadThis required smoke-control in multiple lobbies, firefighting efforts on multiple floors and on the exterior of the building, the need for a change of the evacuation strategy and the need for disabled residents to self-evacuate \u0027for which no facilities were provided within the building\u0027.The scale of the cladding\u0027s shortcomings never appears to have been grasped by any of the key bodies linked to the refurbishment.Dr Lane wrote: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027  Grenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with fire safety and building regulations, report finds as expert slams \u0027incompetency\u0027 in the construction industryGrenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with basic fire safety measures, a damning report has concluded.Dr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, listed an astonishing series of shortcomings in the systems intended to mitigate fire risk.Failure to abide by regulations were identified with the block\u0027s lifts, ventilations systems, fire mains and fire doors.            Residents had been told to \u0027stay put\u0027 in the case of a fire, but fire doors were inadequateThese would have hindered the escape of residents on the night of the fire, as well as the effort to tackle the fire, while also worsening the spread of smoke.Her conclusions came as another expert looking into the Grenfell Tower fire warned of the danger of using \u0027guidelines and simple  tests\u0027 to test buildings and of \u0027incompetency\u0027 within the industry.Professor Jose L Torero hit out at the inadequacy of building guidelines and tests which allow for \u0027obvious dangers\u0027 to be incorporated into cladding systems routinely.He warned that that a \u0027culture shift\u0027 is needed, otherwise \u0027the increasing complexity of building systems will drive society in unidentified paths towards irresponsible deregulation by incompetency.\u0027More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this articleDr Lane and Professor Torero were among five fire safety experts drafted in to aid the Grenfell inquiry into the blaze last June which killed 72 people.Dr Lane wrote: \u0027The number of non-compliances signify a culture of non-compliance at Grenfell Tower.\u0027I am particularly concerned about the maintenance regime of the active and passive fire protection measures.\u0027I note that multiple automatic systems such as the control of the fire lift and the smoke ventilation system, appear not to have operated as required.\u0027 The weakness of the fire doors would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.            Five experts have given reports into the blaze for the inquirySmoke leaked through gaps in the frames and some would probably not have self-closed after fleeing residents, allowing it to spread further. The firefighters themselves may have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, she added.In one particularly grim case, a fire door leading to the stairwell was propped open by a body, the inquiry was told. The automatic air ventilation system in the building was also not \u0027in accordance with current statutory guidance\u0027 and there was evidence it did not operate as intended, she added.The lifts in the building similarly failed to perform effectively in the fire, hampering firefighter equipment transport and creating an \u0027unnecessary risk\u0027 to residents who could not use it to escape.For firefighters, the tower had a \u0027dry fire main\u0027 - meaning the fire service had to pump it with its own water - that was \u0027non-compliant with the design guidance in force at the time of the original construction and is also non-compliant with current standards\u0027.This stopped crews getting water to the upper floors as effectively as a wet main, which provides more pressure by being already charged with a pump that is connected when the service arrives.  Professor Torero hit out at the inadequacy of building guidelines and tests which allow for \u0027obvious dangers\u0027 to be incorporated into cladding systems routinely.  In his report, Prof Torero said the current regulatory framework relies \u0027very heavily\u0027 on competent professionals interpreting the guidelines in such a way that will bridge any gaps and ambiguities.But he claimed there was no definition of the level of competency required from professionals involved in designing and installing cladding systems which would guarantee the delivery of \u0027societally acceptable levels of safety\u0027.He wrote: \u0027There is a need to shift from a culture that inappropriately trivialises \u0027compliance\u0027 to a culture that recognises complexity in \u0027compliance\u0027 and therefore values \u0027competency\u0027, \u0027performance\u0027 and \u0027quality\u0027.\u0027Otherwise, the increasing complexity of building systems will drive society in unidentified paths towards irresponsible deregulation by incompetency.\u0027 He wrote: \u0027Functional requirements, guidelines and simple standardised tests become insufficient tools to establish adequate performance of systems where performance is a function of the interactions of the building and the building envelope.\u0027The inadequacy of these methods of performance assessmentregulation is such that systems that can introduce obvious dangers can be incorporated by designers in a routine manner.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/17/4CE82CC700000578-5803229-image-a-44_1528128092277.jpg","title":"Travellers dump hundreds tons building waste garbage M1 underpass","story":"    Nine lanes of motorway traffic drive over the underpass which is being turned into an unofficial dump site.

How the fire spread: What began as a fire in a single apartment at Grenfell Tower (left) quickly spread (right)The report was just one of five presented to the inquiry yesterday, outlining an incredible catalogue of failures encompassing virtually every aspect of fire safety at the block in Kensington, west London.Almost all elements of fire safety at the tower failed – from dangerous fire doors and windows to firefighters who inadvertently helped the flames to spread – leading to a ‘disproportionately high loss of life’.A fire safety engineer said there was ‘a culture of non-compliance’ at the tower during its £9million refurbishment and its maintenance by a council-appointed body.The failures allowed the fire to engulf the building at a rate never seen before.          Horrified onlookers watch as the blaze tore through Grenfell Tower. Some can be seen taking pictures at the flames raged          Catastrophic: Grenfell Tower is engulfed in flames as the fire spreads rapidly around the block But despite the terrifying speed of the fire’s spread, families in the high rise were told to ‘stay put’ and await rescue in a fire brigade policy that may have cost lives.Experts told the inquiry the policy had ‘effectively failed’ within 30 minutes of the first 999 call. Despite this, it was not formally abandoned until almost two hours after the blaze broke out.The public inquiry revealed shocking photographs showing the devastation at Flat 16, where the fire broke out on the fourth floor, and a recording of the first 999 call.The five expert reports revealed:Cladding installed during the refurbishment contained a flammable plastic that gave the fire a ‘fuel source’It did not comply with building regulations and no full-scale tests had been carried out before it was installedFire stops between each floor were not installed correctly, meaning nothing prevented the fire jumping between levelsIneffective fire doors failed after just 20 minutes instead of an hourWindows were not fire-resistant, and window frames were surrounded by combustible plasticThe building’s only stairwell filled with smoke after ventilation systems failed and doors were blocked open by firefighters’ hoses and – in one case – a dead bodyFirefighters did not tackle the kitchen fire that sparked the blaze until four minutes after it had spread up the outside claddingWater supply systems in the block, installed for firefighters’ hoses, could not meet demandThe ‘stay put’ policy began to fail 21 minutes after the first 999 call, but was kept for two hours.The inquiry has heard heart-breaking evidence from families who lost relatives in the inferno.The inquiry’s lead lawyer, Richard Millett QC, said survivors and the bereaved were left with ‘an abiding sense of injustice, betrayal and marginalisation, leading to an overwhelming question: Why?’.He said the inquiry – the largest of its kind in British legal history – would ‘lay bare the truth’.He said Grenfell Tower’s refurbishment had ‘created an intolerable fire hazard’ and called the cladding on the outside of the building ‘a catastrophic failure’.Authorities believed any fire inside would be limited to the flat where it broke out, and were caught out by the ‘unprecedented’ speed and ferocity of the blaze.Mr Millett made thinly veiled criticisms of the firms and public bodies involved in the tower’s construction, refurbishment and maintenance – all of which have been asked to provide written statements. It was owned by Kensington and Chelsea council and run by its tenant management group.In a statement, London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton said: ‘I have never seen a building where the whole of it was on fire. Nobody has ever seen that.‘It was incredible, it was so alien to anything I have ever seen.’ Firefighters arrived six minutes after the first 999 call at 12.54am, but did not enter the kitchen of Flat 16 until 1.14am or begin fighting the fire until 1.20am, by which time it had burned through the new windows’ flammable uPVC frames and lit the exterior cladding."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/00/0653ED37000003E8-5805875-image-a-61_1528155985491.jpg","title":"World Cup host Gary Lineker says just corrupt Russia","story":"    Lineker will lead BBC Sport’s coverage of the World Cup, which begins next Thursday          Vladimir Putin\u0027s World Cup has been mired in controversy from security fears to corruption scandalsSocceroos star, 25, is forced to put honeymoon with his...Lily Allen wears gold AK-47 necklace as she performs at...Pubs across Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags from World Cup...Share this article    The World Cup kicks off later this month with hundreds of thousands of fans descending on Russia          The 57-year-old also dismissed fears that England fans will be targeted by Russian hooligans"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/00/4C69EA2300000578-0-image-m-41_1526686486537.jpg","title":"BBC newsreader Tina Daheley says theres bias lighter skinned Asian black celebrities","story":"    BBC newsreader Tina Daheley, the daughter of first-generation immigrant parents, claimed Asian or black women are more likely to get ahead if they have lighter skinAlongside a link, she tweeted: ‘As someone of Asian heritage with dark skin, I can tell you that light-skin privilege is REAL’.The piece, which she described as ‘great’, explored whether black women with lighter skin were more likely to succeed because of ‘colourism’ in the music and film industry.It comes after Matthew Knowles, singer Beyonce’s father, said the music world was prejudiced against black singers with darker skin.

The Tunisian coastguard is pictured on patrol off the northern town of Bizerte in MayThe latest death toll was published around 7pm, after the search and rescue operation had ended for the day.The hunt for survivors would continue on Monday morning, Mohammed Salah Sagaama from Sfax\u0027s naval base told AFP.Tunisians and migrants regularly try to cross the Mediterranean to seek a better future in Europe, with 120 mainly Tunisians rescued by their navy in March after trying to reach Italy.In October, a collision between a migrant boat and a Tunisian military ship left at least 44 dead, in what Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called a \u0027national disaster\u0027.The latest shipwreck is the most deadly in the Mediterranean since February 2 when 90 people drowned off the coast of Libya, according to the IOM.Across the Mediterranean, nine Syrians including seven children drowned when their vessel sank off the coast of Turkey.The group were travelling in a speedboat intending to head illegally to Europe, when the boat hit trouble off the coast of the southern Antalya province, state media reports said.  Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     The League says the vast majority of migrants in Italy have no right to refugee status, Italy cannot afford to help them and by accepting low pay they worsen the working conditions of Italians.Salvini kept up the pressure on Monday, vowing to lobby Italy\u0027s partners to obtain more EU assistance to handle the problem.\u0027It\u0027s clear and obvious that Italy has been abandoned, now we have to see facts,\u0027 Salvini said, when asked about comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel that Europe needs a new approach on immigration. Italy has become the main route into Europe for economic migrants and asylum seekers, with hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea. The other main route, from Turkey to Greece, was largely shut after more than 1 million people arrived in 2015.The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town\u0027s migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech yesterday, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.One protester brandished a sign saying \u0027refugees welcome\u0027, while a supporter said \u0027we don\u0027t want any more pests\u0027 and others simply chanted \u0027Matteo, Matteo\u0027.          There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  Pozzallo is on the front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle EastAfter delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry\u0027s experts \u0027how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions\u0027.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said on Saturday.However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/11/4CE6960D00000578-5803013-image-m-72_1528108627184.jpg","title":"First pictures inside gutted flat Grenfell inferno began","story":"This is the kitchen of flat 16, Grenfell Tower, where the fire which claimed 72 lives began. A report today found that the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 a fridge freezer in the flat\u0027s kitchen. A series of expert reports today showed how flammable cladding and muddled fire safety plans exacerbated the impact of the blaze          The report found there were a number of electrical appliances around the fridge which may have sparked the blaze  Officials said the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 the fridge-freezer, but could not be sure whether a fault with the device was the cause of the fire or whether it started in another of the kitchen\u0027s many electrical items          A photo taken during the investigation shows an electrical cooking device between the fridge freezer and the window  The report quotes a statement from one of the flat\u0027s three residents, Behailu Kebede. He raised the alarm after being woken by a fire alarm and finding smoke in his kitchenThe recording was played after the publication of a damning report found the cladding put on the outside of the building did not comply \u0027with recommended fire performance\u0027 and criticised the \u0027stay-put\u0027 policy which encouraged residents to remain in their flats in the event of the fire.Fire-safety engineer Barbara Lane said the fire service\u0027s  policy had \u0027effectively failed\u0027 barely a half-hour after the fire started, but residents weren\u0027t told to evacuate for more than an hour after that.The cladding meant the fire spread up seven storeys within seven minutes,  with 70 flats ablaze in under two hours. The disaster was compounded by non-compliant fire doors, combustible window fittings and a faulty firefighting lift. Ms Lane said that a renovation of the building completed in 2016 installed flammable  cladding on the tower\u0027s facade which led to \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this article\u0027The assembly failed adequately to resist the spread of fire\u0027 to an extent that would have support a \u0027stay put\u0027 policy, she said.Ms Lane said there had been \u0027a culture of non-compliance\u0027 with safety regulations, and identified multiple failures.The \u0027stay put\u0027 guidance which was given to residents before the fire was eventually abandoned at 2.47am - around two hours after the fire started.Ms Lane\u0027s report said it is unclear why there was such a gap between the advice being rendered redundant and the fire service changing tack, the report said.\u0027I am particularly concerned by the delay from 2.06am, when a major incident was declared, to 2.47am,\u0027 Dr Lane continued.           A photo of the flat once the debris had been cleared away shows how the other electrical items added to the damage done          Burn marks show the area beneath where the fridge-freezer stood. The skirting board behind the appliance had burned away          The fire started in the kitchen of the two-bedroom flat. The kitchen had sliding doors which opened onto the living room, pictured, where one of the flat\u0027s three occupants lived          The floor of flat 16\u0027s kitchen was strewn with wreckage of kitchen appliances when investigators got inside. The partition where sliding doors had led to the living room was almost completely burned away          Three people lived in the flat at the time of blaze. Two women had a bedroom each and a man lived in the living room  A picture taken through the front door of the flat (left) shows limited damage to the entrance hallway. As firefighters moved towards the kitchen however, the fire was much more intense, scorching the hallway leading to the kitchen (right)          Grainy images taken from body cameras worn by firefighters show the moment they opened to door to the kitchen fire          The plan show the flat. The fire started in the south-east corner, the bottom right of the image          An estimated picture of the layout of the kitchen shows a number of appliances around the freezer where the blaze started          A plan of the fourth floor shows there were five other flats on that storey of the building. Flat 16 resident Mr Kebede said he woke neigbours after discovering the blazeBut University of Dundee Professor Niamh Daeid wrote: \u0027On the basis of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the area of origin of the fire was in, or around, the tall fridge freezer in the southeast part of the kitchen.\u0027The cause of the fire remains undetermined although, based on the available information, it is more likely than not to be an accidental cause rather than a deliberate act.\u0027The originating fire within flat 16 extended out of the kitchen window of the flat and at some point re-entered through the window of the bedroom next to the living room of flat 16 causing further damage to the flat.\u0027 In a departure from information given by the Met Police, another expert said there was \u0027insufficient evidence\u0027 that the fire was started by the fridge-freezer.In another separate report, Professor Luke Bisby, from the University of Edinburgh, wrote: \u0027Some evidence exists to support a hypothesis that the fire started in the south-east side of the kitchen and in the general area of the Hotpoint FF175P fridge-freezer, however, there is currently insufficient evidence, even based on a balance of probabilities, in my opinion, to support the hypothesis that the fire originated in the fridge-freezer, and to exclude all other potential sources of ignition.\u0027With regard to other possible sources of ignition, I have not seen sufficiently convincing evidence to confidently identify the origin of the initial fire.\u0027 Shocking footage shows how a fire which started in a kitchen of a Grenfell Tower flat leapt up the side of the building. The left hand image is timed at 1.08am, not long after the blaze began. By 1.12am the fire had already started to growIn clips estimated to have been filmed between 1.16 and 1.20am, burning debris could be seen falling from the tower, and screaming could be heard.\u0027I told you, I told you get out,\u0027 one man could be heard shouting in a further clip.Six clips showing the side of the tower as it became engulfed with flames were shown side by side.\u0027Oh my god,\u0027 one woman said as huge pieces of fiery debris rained down from the blazing tower.Another could be heard sobbing as it became apparent the fire was out of control.After the video was shown, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said: \u0027It is truly shocking, every time you see it, it strikes you in a very similar way, very strongly.\u0027   This image, timed at 1.15 am, shows how, helped by flammable cladding and window materials, the fire began to grow  By 1:24am (left), the flames were burning through flats on multiple floors. An image taken from footage filmed around 1.28am (right) shows how, aided by what a report called \u0027multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes\u0027, the fire reached the top                                                      More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did nothing and a shambolic \u0027stay put\u0027 policy: Litany of Grenfell safety failings that led to a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027           \u0027Stay put\u0027 advice to Grenfell Tower residents from the emergency services that was in place for almost two hours after the fire began was a \u0027total failure\u0027 according to an expert witness. Pictured are ambulance teams at the scene of the blazeDeadly doors and cladding coupled with advice to victims stay in their flats as Grenfell Tower was engulfed by fire caused a \u0027disproportionately high loss of life\u0027, the inquiry into Britain\u0027s worst blaze in living memory revealed today.Expert witness Dr Barbara Lane decried the \u0027stay put\u0027 advice given by the emergency services to residents trapped in the burning building as a \u0027total failure\u0027 and \u0027substantially to blame for the tragedy\u0027.Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed it took one hour and 11 minutes for the authorities to change their minds and start an evacuation.But by then there was little hope of escaping the tower, which was engulfed in flames in just 20 minutes.Dr Lane also spoke of a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 at Grenfell, which had there were more than 100 non-compliant fire doors, a firefighting lift that didn\u0027t work and a tinderbox cladding system and draughty windows that accelerated the blaze. Dr Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, revealed that it took one hour and 11 minutes between when it became clear the safety advice had failed and when it officially changed to tell residents to leave.The advice from the emergency services was in place for almost two hours and was repeatedly told to those inside ringing 999 for help.Dr Lane wrote in her report that this failure \u0027would have materially affected the ability or willingness of occupants to escape independently through this space to the stair\u0027.It would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.          \u0027Non compliant\u0027 fire doors were also blamed for the spread of the flames while firefighters \u0027may have contributed\u0027 by leaving doors openIn 2011, the Tenant Management Organisation - which ran the building - replaced 106 flat entrance fire doors. None of the doors on any of the 120 flats - including the 14 not replaced - were compliant with the fire test evidence relied upon at the time of installation, Dr Lane found.These shortcomings would have had a number of consequences, including failure to prevent the spread of smoke and flame by leakage through gaps between the door leaf and door frame.Another failure of an \u0027unknown number of doors\u0027 to self-close after an occupant escaped would have allowed \u0027immediate\u0027 spread of fire and smoke.  A table from the report on the spread of the blaze shows how quickly the number of flat affected rose The lobbies could therefore not be used as a \u0027safe air environment\u0027 by the fire service bridgehead, forcing it to remain below level 4 until 7.30am.\u0027This greatly reduced the time available using breathing apparatus, and so the time available for rescue on the upper floors, and particularly above Level 15.\u0027Firefighters may also have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, Dr Lane found.She wrote: \u0027I have identified the fact that the firefighting operations in response to the multi-storey fire may have contributed to the failure of the stair fire doors to prevent fire and smoke spread.\u0027Current evidence indicates some of the stair doors were ajar as firefighting hoses were running from the stair into the lobby. However, I currently do not know the number of doors involved, nor which specific doors, nor for how long this opening may have occurred. I cannot yet conclude whether this made a significant contribution.\u0027In one case, a fire door to the stairwell was held open by a body, the report said.The expert\u0027s evidence also blamed the building\u0027s windows for allowing the fire to spread to the combustible cladding, which led to its rapid spread up the tower.She said the window frames were not protected with fire resistant barriers but instead with \u0027combustible materials\u0027 allowing the blaze to expand unchecked.          A photo shows the softened uPVC finish revealing the cavity and combustible insulation board within in living room in flat 16Another of her conclusions was that key bodies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower understood how the new cladding system would behave in a fire, a report has said.In the report Dr Lane said: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027          Pictured: All of the 72 victims of the Grenfell fire disaster and where they lived  Grenfell cladding had SEVEN catastrophic faults, was incorrectly installed and \u0027substantially to blame\u0027 for disaster that killed 72, inquiry hearsGrenfell Tower\u0027s cladding did not comply with building regulations, was badly installed and created routes for a fire to spread, a damning report into the blaze has concluded.Five fire safety experts have been examining the fire in which 82 people died and today gave their views on how the fire started, how it spread and why so many people were killed.Dr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, delivered an excoriating assessment of the refurbishment which finished a year before the fire.The rainscreen cladding put on the building used material that did not meet fire safety standards, while the system as a whole was not capable of effectively preventing the inferno spreading, she found.            The cladding on the outside of Grenfell Tower was to blame for the fire spreadingAnother expert, Professor Luke Bisby, found a series of problems with refurbishment work carried out on Grenfell before the fire.Prof Bisby said the main reason the fire spread was the polyethylene-filled ACM rainscreen in the cladding.He also said combustible insulation, the presence of cavities and the use of combustible window frames added to the spread of the blaze.More than 100 non-compliant fire doors, cladding that did...Have they learned nothing? Residents of ten blocks in shadow...Share this articleProf Bishby also identified the lack of cavity barriers between sections of the cladding, a \u0027crown detail\u0027 which helped the fire spread sideways and exposed parts of the combustible core added to the fire.In her report meanwhile, Dr Lane found there was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.She wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027        A detail from a report shows the cladding on the building which helped the fire spreadThis required smoke-control in multiple lobbies, firefighting efforts on multiple floors and on the exterior of the building, the need for a change of the evacuation strategy and the need for disabled residents to self-evacuate \u0027for which no facilities were provided within the building\u0027.The scale of the cladding\u0027s shortcomings never appears to have been grasped by any of the key bodies linked to the refurbishment.Dr Lane wrote: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027  Grenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with fire safety and building regulations, report finds as expert slams \u0027incompetency\u0027 in the construction industryGrenfell Tower was plagued by a \u0027culture of non-compliance\u0027 with basic fire safety measures, a damning report has concluded.Dr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, listed an astonishing series of shortcomings in the systems intended to mitigate fire risk.Failure to abide by regulations were identified with the block\u0027s lifts, ventilations systems, fire mains and fire doors.

Five experts have given reports into the blaze for the inquirySmoke leaked through gaps in the frames and some would probably not have self-closed after fleeing residents, allowing it to spread further. The firefighters themselves may have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, she added.In one particularly grim case, a fire door leading to the stairwell was propped open by a body, the inquiry was told. The automatic air ventilation system in the building was also not \u0027in accordance with current statutory guidance\u0027 and there was evidence it did not operate as intended, she added.The lifts in the building similarly failed to perform effectively in the fire, hampering firefighter equipment transport and creating an \u0027unnecessary risk\u0027 to residents who could not use it to escape.For firefighters, the tower had a \u0027dry fire main\u0027 - meaning the fire service had to pump it with its own water - that was \u0027non-compliant with the design guidance in force at the time of the original construction and is also non-compliant with current standards\u0027.This stopped crews getting water to the upper floors as effectively as a wet main, which provides more pressure by being already charged with a pump that is connected when the service arrives.  Professor Torero hit out at the inadequacy of building guidelines and tests which allow for \u0027obvious dangers\u0027 to be incorporated into cladding systems routinely.  In his report, Prof Torero said the current regulatory framework relies \u0027very heavily\u0027 on competent professionals interpreting the guidelines in such a way that will bridge any gaps and ambiguities.But he claimed there was no definition of the level of competency required from professionals involved in designing and installing cladding systems which would guarantee the delivery of \u0027societally acceptable levels of safety\u0027.He wrote: \u0027There is a need to shift from a culture that inappropriately trivialises \u0027compliance\u0027 to a culture that recognises complexity in \u0027compliance\u0027 and therefore values \u0027competency\u0027, \u0027performance\u0027 and \u0027quality\u0027.\u0027Otherwise, the increasing complexity of building systems will drive society in unidentified paths towards irresponsible deregulation by incompetency.\u0027 He wrote: \u0027Functional requirements, guidelines and simple standardised tests become insufficient tools to establish adequate performance of systems where performance is a function of the interactions of the building and the building envelope.\u0027The inadequacy of these methods of performance assessmentregulation is such that systems that can introduce obvious dangers can be incorporated by designers in a routine manner.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/17/4CE82CC700000578-5803229-image-a-44_1528128092277.jpg","title":"Travellers dump hundreds tons building waste garbage M1 underpass","story":"    Nine lanes of motorway traffic drive over the underpass which is being turned into an unofficial dump site.

A table from a report published today shows how quickly flats were engulfedDr Barbara Lane, an expert commissioned by the Grenfell Tower inquiry, delivered an excoriating assessment of the refurbishment which finished a year before the fire.The rainscreen cladding put on the building used material that did not meet fire safety standards, while the system as a whole was not capable of effectively preventing the inferno spreading.In a report published on Monday, Dr Lane wrote: \u0027There were multiple catastrophic fire-spread routes created by the construction form and construction detailing.\u0027Windows in inidual flats had no fire barriers encasing them and these openings were surrounded by combustible material, the expert found.Such a shortcoming \u0027increased the likelihood of that fire breaking into the large cavities contained within the cladding system\u0027 and provided \u0027no means to control the spread of fire and smoke\u0027.The gap beyond the window, in turn, was supposed to have fire-stops at intervals which would halt the advance of flames - but these were installed incorrectly.There was also no evidence they had ever been tested for performance in the cladding system.

How the fire spread: What began as a fire in a single apartment at Grenfell Tower (left) quickly spread (right)The report was just one of five presented to the inquiry yesterday, outlining an incredible catalogue of failures encompassing virtually every aspect of fire safety at the block in Kensington, west London.Almost all elements of fire safety at the tower failed – from dangerous fire doors and windows to firefighters who inadvertently helped the flames to spread – leading to a ‘disproportionately high loss of life’.A fire safety engineer said there was ‘a culture of non-compliance’ at the tower during its £9million refurbishment and its maintenance by a council-appointed body.The failures allowed the fire to engulf the building at a rate never seen before.          Horrified onlookers watch as the blaze tore through Grenfell Tower. Some can be seen taking pictures at the flames raged          Catastrophic: Grenfell Tower is engulfed in flames as the fire spreads rapidly around the block But despite the terrifying speed of the fire’s spread, families in the high rise were told to ‘stay put’ and await rescue in a fire brigade policy that may have cost lives.Experts told the inquiry the policy had ‘effectively failed’ within 30 minutes of the first 999 call. Despite this, it was not formally abandoned until almost two hours after the blaze broke out.The public inquiry revealed shocking photographs showing the devastation at Flat 16, where the fire broke out on the fourth floor, and a recording of the first 999 call.The five expert reports revealed:Cladding installed during the refurbishment contained a flammable plastic that gave the fire a ‘fuel source’It did not comply with building regulations and no full-scale tests had been carried out before it was installedFire stops between each floor were not installed correctly, meaning nothing prevented the fire jumping between levelsIneffective fire doors failed after just 20 minutes instead of an hourWindows were not fire-resistant, and window frames were surrounded by combustible plasticThe building’s only stairwell filled with smoke after ventilation systems failed and doors were blocked open by firefighters’ hoses and – in one case – a dead bodyFirefighters did not tackle the kitchen fire that sparked the blaze until four minutes after it had spread up the outside claddingWater supply systems in the block, installed for firefighters’ hoses, could not meet demandThe ‘stay put’ policy began to fail 21 minutes after the first 999 call, but was kept for two hours.The inquiry has heard heart-breaking evidence from families who lost relatives in the inferno.The inquiry’s lead lawyer, Richard Millett QC, said survivors and the bereaved were left with ‘an abiding sense of injustice, betrayal and marginalisation, leading to an overwhelming question: Why?’.He said the inquiry – the largest of its kind in British legal history – would ‘lay bare the truth’.He said Grenfell Tower’s refurbishment had ‘created an intolerable fire hazard’ and called the cladding on the outside of the building ‘a catastrophic failure’.Authorities believed any fire inside would be limited to the flat where it broke out, and were caught out by the ‘unprecedented’ speed and ferocity of the blaze.Mr Millett made thinly veiled criticisms of the firms and public bodies involved in the tower’s construction, refurbishment and maintenance – all of which have been asked to provide written statements. It was owned by Kensington and Chelsea council and run by its tenant management group.In a statement, London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton said: ‘I have never seen a building where the whole of it was on fire. Nobody has ever seen that.‘It was incredible, it was so alien to anything I have ever seen.’ Firefighters arrived six minutes after the first 999 call at 12.54am, but did not enter the kitchen of Flat 16 until 1.14am or begin fighting the fire until 1.20am, by which time it had burned through the new windows’ flammable uPVC frames and lit the exterior cladding."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/00/4C69EA2300000578-0-image-m-41_1526686486537.jpg","title":"BBC newsreader Tina Daheley says theres bias lighter skinned Asian black celebrities","story":"    BBC newsreader Tina Daheley, the daughter of first-generation immigrant parents, claimed Asian or black women are more likely to get ahead if they have lighter skinAlongside a link, she tweeted: ‘As someone of Asian heritage with dark skin, I can tell you that light-skin privilege is REAL’.The piece, which she described as ‘great’, explored whether black women with lighter skin were more likely to succeed because of ‘colourism’ in the music and film industry.It comes after Matthew Knowles, singer Beyonce’s father, said the music world was prejudiced against black singers with darker skin.

She then applied for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to prevent the publication of a collection of stories by various authors, Cocktales: The Cocky Collective, which was written as an act of protest against Hopkins’s trademark.Her lawsuit was filed against Tara Crescent, author of another book series that used the word “cocky”, the lawyer Kevin Kneupper, who had filed a legal challenge to have Hopkins’s trademark in “cocky” cancelled, and Cocktales’s publicist Jennifer Watson.The Authors Guild and Romance Writers of America joined forces to provide Crescent with legal assistance and “defend the principle that no one should be able to own exclusive rights to use a common word” in book titles. They argued that “countless romance novels employed ‘cocky’” in their titles well before Hopkins laid claim to it, that “no one should hold a monopoly on cocky”, and that “cockiness (in all its permutations) remains as prevalent in romance novels as the use of stunning, scantily clad models on their covers”.It would be, they wrote, “like an author claiming trademark rights in the word death as a series title for murder mysteries and suing anyone who used that word in the title of their crime stories”.“Any order that restricts creative expression in favour of promoting the tenuous (at best) purported rights of a single author is simply contrary to the public interest in freedom of expression,” wrote the guild, adding that it “seldom” litigates for inidual authors, but felt in this case that it was “an important issue for authors generally”.In the case, heard in a New York court on Friday, judge Alvin Hellerstein described romance readers as “sophisticated purchasers” unlikely to be confused between different authors’ books, found that cocky was a “weak trademark”, and denied Hopkins’s motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order to stop the publication of books with the word “cocky” in the title. Kneupper, who was removed from the case, will be allowed to continue his legal challenge to Hopkin’s trademark in relation to the word’s use in series titles.“Authors should be able to express themselves in their choice of titles,” said the Authors Guild in a statement after the hearing. “A single word commonly used in book titles cannot be “owned” by one author. This is especially true when, as here, the word has already been in use by other authors in titles for years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/168bcf3c5f1870a261ef3ce8d8826e26b0b762b9/0_205_2728_1637/master/2728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc65f4ac6373ea6e3f0094ff9cd888fe","title":"water company fat cats give labour a soft target for nationalisation talk","story":"Remuneration committees have put too much stock in balance sheets over common senseThe GMB union makes a fair point about pay at the top of the privately owned English water industry. When a few iniduals can collect almost £2.5m a year for running local monopolies, remuneration committees have spent too much time looking at consultants’ spreadsheets and too little employing common sense.Yes, these businesses are large, important and must spend serious sums on new infrastructure every year. Yet a regional water company is also running a public service in which the price of the product is set by the regulator and customers cannot choose a different supplier. Those factors call for restraint, or at least a more direct tie between incentive pay and the level of service that is provided.Even the environment secretary, Michael Gove, made a similar point in an exchange of letters with Jonson Cox, the chairman of regulator Ofwat, earlier this year. We await the companies’ response in their business plans for next year but don’t hold your breath if you’re expecting radical reform. To pick on Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent, only about a third of her annual bonus last year of £616,000 related directly to customers’ experience. Some of the profit-related measures involved hitting targets where benefits are shared with customers, it could be argued, but her LTIP plan, which paid her £975,000 last year, looks as purely financial as any other FTSE 100 company’s.As the nationalisation debate heats up, pay has become a blind spot for water companies. The likes of Thames, Yorkshire and Anglian are dismantling their Cayman Islands subsidiaries to try to defuse the charge of financial engineering. Some of the worst offenders are also reducing their debt levels, partly under pressure from Ofwat and partly because they recognise the mood has turned against extreme financial leverage. But boardroom rewards, unless the companies are about to surprise us, remain stuck at levels that are a gift to the nationalisation lobby. Shareholders and owners, unless they wish to continue to present Labour’s front-bench with an open goal, ought to wake up.As it is, Labour’s nationalisation plan is gloriously vague since the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, hasn’t yet explained which model of public ownership he prefers (there are many to choose from) or how he would tackle investors’ (including pension funds’ and employees’) legal claims for compensation if he attempts nationalisation at less than market value. Nor is it possible to tell if Labour’s boast that bills would fall after nationalisation by £100 per household is just achieved by shoving the difference into general taxation.The GMB, note, also ignored such detailed questions as it launched its campaign for public ownership of the English water industry. It is simpler, from where it stands, to point to excesses in the boardroom, on which (almost) everyone can agree. The water companies, if they want to prepare properly for a nationalisation debate that is not going away, need to shape up on pay and stop offering such a soft target.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has got one thing right: he has ignored any thought of mounting a flashy sale of shares to retail investors complete with loyalty bonuses. His predecessor, George Osborne, was tempted by that idea when he was disposing of shares in Lloyds Banking Group, but eventually thought better of it. Quite right too: the Treasury’s sole job is to get the best possible price for the public purse, which inevitably means selling to City institutions in a competitive market process.The Treasury’s timing, though, looks odd. Banks’ share prices across Europe have been upset by the political confusion in Italy. Even RBS’ finance director, Ewen Stevenson, said last week that now is probably not the “optimum” time for the government to start selling stock. Indeed so. RBS was within pennies of 300p a fortnight ago, which would have been a neat hurdle to clear, but closed last night at 280.4p.Perfect timing is impossible, of course, and the break-even price in any case is about 500p. But the Treasury, advised by UK Government Investments, could still have waited a few weeks to see if the Italian influence on the bank stocks fades fully. The government wants to get on with the job – but, really, where was the harm in waiting a fortnight?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b526148c33626d62c4b8db9a3ca65207118e6ca5/0_315_4815_2889/4815.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd204d503aa07ac68dccde896cdabee1","title":"what to do in toronto a 48 hour itinerary","story":"A year-round cultural buzz from the film festival, plus amazing architecture and a huge history of ethnic ersity mean there’s a lot to be seen, done and eaten in the Ontarian capital. Get the best of ‘Canada’s downtown’ with a two-day itinerary from local writer Jim ByersMorningStart with a tour of the city’s most historic district, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood. Local historianman-about-town Bruce Bell will show you interesting views of the St. Lawrence Market (proclaimed best in the world by National Geographic) – and the historic town jail. The market is filled with everything from water buffalo sliders to smoked teriyaki salmon and fresh raspberries as deep and red as the Maple Leaf flag.Stop in the market for a class Canadian lunch: a peameal bacon sandwich at Carousel Bakery. For about £4 (C$7), you’ll get thick, juicy slices of bacon that are really more like cured ham. Other options at the market include tasty veal or chicken sandwiches drenched in tomato sauce (and sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms) at Uno Mustachio. Want something more formal? The highly rated Biagio is nearby.AfternoonFrom the market, head east on the Queen streetcar to The Beaches neighbourhood. Toronto has a series of fine beaches along Lake Ontario, with boardwalks and bike trails that march for miles alongside shady parks. There’s decent swimming in summer, as well as stand-up paddle boarding and beach volleyball played by athletic, youthful locals. If that’s your thing.EveningStop in at the Distillery District for a local lager or ale at Mill Street Brew Pub. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas with great views of the restored industrial sheen of this historic district, once part of the Gooderham and Worts distilling empire. If you’re not a drinker, settle in for a fabulous coffee at Balzac’s (open ’til 8pm) – grab a spot on the second-floor balcony for great views of the crowds below. Shops in the area include Corktown Designs (nice jewellery) and John Fluevog for shoes, and there are several cool galleries. For food, El Catrin restaurant has a terrific patio or the super-colourful mural indoors is an equally impressive backdrop. Try the guacamole, which they make at your table, or the pork tacos.MorningTry breakfast at Over Easy, a nice cafe with just the right ambience on Yonge Street. If you want something lighter (and with fancier coffee), head instead to Dineen, just a few blocks north.To really appreciate Toronto, you need to visit one of the city parks when the weather is nice. People from all over the world congregate at open barbecues and play games or loll in the shade as the smoke from their lunch rises higher in the air. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a trendy spot in the West End, while Riverdale Park has a free farm kids will love. A trip to the Toronto Islands also allows you the park experience plus a short ferry ride (but come early to avoid crowds). Alternatively, check out quiet waterways by canoe, or admire the refurbished homes on Ward’s Island. There’s a legal nude beach at Hanlan’s Point too, near where former baseball legend Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run.AfternoonSome visitors hit the heights at the CN Tower (the highest observation area is 447 meters high) when they first get here. I think it’s best to enjoy the view after you’ve seen a bit and know what you’re looking at. You can try the Edge Walk and suspend yourself from the roof via a cable if you like, or just enjoy the scenery from inside like a normal person.Kensington Market is one of the city’s other iconic sights. It’s been an area dominated by Jewish, Portuguese and Chinese immigrants (and others) over the years. Nowadays it’s a mixture of all of the above, along with hipster joints, Caribbean spots and CentralSouth American shops and restaurants. They close the streets to traffic on Sundays and the area becomes a parade of people from around the globe. Stop at Rasta Pasta for great jerk chicken and rice (C$5 for a sizeable portion), or try Amadeu’s for a taste of Portugal.EveningA drink on the Ritz-Carlton terrace is in order. It’s in a quiet spot backing on to a small park, and they have some lovely Cuban-style drinks on the menu. Not far away is the Wheat Sheaf, billed as Toronto’s oldest tavern. And up on Dundas Street West, Rhum Corner has exceptional rum drinks and a Caribbean-meets-the-big-city feel.Finish up with dinner on Ossington Avenue, the city’s “hippest” street. Boralia makes meals based on recipes from Canada that date back as far as 1605, including mussels cooked over smoking pine needles (allegedly a recipe that explorer Samuel Champlain used in 1605). Grab a gourmet ice cream sandwich at Bang Bang Ice Cream to finish your night.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9782b4c2e169ab67c091ca14a0315538c2b5ea0f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb344b738bfdeb0a74dd95b3f74ff8","title":"a fashion lovers guide to canada","story":"Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …What I knew about Canada before I embarked on my one-week, three-city trip this summer was limited to a handful of sources: 90s TV show North of 60, Drake songs (which can arguably be seen as a Toronto guidebook written by its most famous resident), and the work of iconic brands such as Roots and Herschel.What I didn’t know was that by the time I left, I’d have discovered one of the most talented crops of local makers and designers anywhere in the world, eaten the best tacos of my life, and experienced a view – on the summit of Vancouver’s Howe Sound – that made me feel insignificant in the best possible way. And that’s to say nothing of the incredible people I met – and the raw energy of the country’s erse, accepting and multicultural cities. Canada really is a place without barriers – somewhere no one could feel like an outsider.I arrived in Toronto with high expectations and I can honestly say that they were surpassed. World-class boutiques, killer vintage finds and an unmistakable big town buzz. This is a city that has its pulse on contemporary fashion.Ice cream and being seen on Queen Street WestQueen Street West is Toronto’s creative and fashion hub – and somewhere that’s been on my radar since Vogue crowned it one of the world’s top three hippest neighbourhoods in 2014. It’s easy to see why. Not only is it home to high-end destination boutiques, such as Nomad, but it’s also a platform for Toronto’s homegrown talent – there are a lot of independent boutiques supporting each other in this prime location.I discovered local makers such as YNOT and Kotn, who are representing everything that’s great about contemporary Toronto as a city and Canada as a country with their designs. YNOT’s sturdy, stylish rucksacks and hardwearing jackets call to mind how connected to nature you are in Canada – even in the middle of its biggest city – while Kotn’s clean and elegant basics represent luxury in its simplest form.If you’re looking to mix local selections with high-end international pieces, head to Nomad – the boutique stocks an excellent range of powerhouse names such as Comme des Garçons and Raf Simons. My top Queen Street West tip? Take a long stroll, heading west to east, with an ice cream in hand from iHalo Krunch.Vintage finds in Kensington MarketIf you love vintage, there’s nowhere better than Kensington Market. This hip, colourful neighbourhood near downtown Toronto has a plethora of stores packed with wonderful finds. It has an amazing sense of street life too: turn any corner and you’ll find bars with small outdoor performance spaces, full of drinkers enjoying a show in the sun, or – as I did – dining at truly quirky restaurants, such as Rasta Pasta, the home of Jamaican-Italian fusion.Seeing where the magic happens at the Roots factoryRoots is probably the quintessential Canadian brand. Again, the strong connection to nature comes through in what it produces. Roots has been part of pop culture for years, yet still manages to feel current – proved by its recent collaboration with Drake. The rapper had a range of varsity jackets for his OVO label co-produced with the brand.I had the chance to visit the factory, which was fascinating from my perspective as a tailor and designer, to get an insight into its production processes. One thing is for sure: they really know their leather. It was also great to understand who makes it and why. Walking into the factory, you see flags everywhere, representing all of the different nations Roots’ employees come from. It really reflects Canada’s multicultural vibe – people bring their own roots to Roots.Cool Canadiana at Drake General StoreJust across the street from the Drake Hotel on Queen West, Drake General Store is like a souvenir shop for people who wouldn’t normally buy souvenirs. It’s a stylish space full of considered Canadiana, where all of the products have a curated feel – from the beautiful Alberta-made blanket I picked up, to the artisan maple syrup I brought for my friend who runs a cafe back home in south London. If you’re only visiting Toronto but want to get a sense of the whole of Canada, it’s the place to go.New architecture and timeless art at the Art Gallery of OntarioI was really excited to see the recent Frank Gehry extension of the Art Gallery of Ontario it’s a stunning addition to an already stunning building. Inside, I got to see some of the fantastic work by the Group of Seven – a group of Canadian landscape painters who initiated Canada’s first major national art movement.Fring’s by name, fring by natureNamed and frequented by Drake, Fring’s delivers a unique fusion of Asian and soul food under the stewardship of Canadian celebrity chef Susur Lee. Fring’s derives its name from Canadian-Caribbean patois, translating roughly to “good times remembered” – and after one meal here I’ve got no reservations in saying that the moniker fits. It’s an intimate space with a first-rate interior fit out, and the Hong Kong chicken and waffles with maple chili glaze were unforgettable.If only I’d had more than two days in Montreal. It’s a city unlike any other – a perfect blend of European charm and North American hustle. It’s also a place for those who love the finer things in life: amazing food, slick bars and very stylish people.Mont RoyalThe size and scale of the green spaces in Canada’s cities is something that I still struggle to get my head around – Montreal’s Mont Royal, also known as Mount Royal, is no exception. The vista over the city from the highest point of the park takes in all of downtown Montreal, while the walking route back downhill towards Saint-Laurent offers a great view of the nine-storey Leonard Cohen mural keeping watch over his old borough.Sheer ‘jeanius’ at Naked \u0026amp Famous DenimBrandon Svarc is a denim genius. Producing jeans under his Naked \u0026amp Famous moniker, he’s a maker who knows his product so well that he can stretch it to its limits – whether its dyeing jeans in green tea or red wine, or producing the heaviest pair of jeans in the world out of 32oz Japanese selvedge denim. The Naked \u0026amp Famous factory is right on top of the store. The denim gets made on the third floor and is sold downstairs in the Tate \u0026amp Yoko boutique.My idea of heaven at Maison CloakroomI wasn’t expecting this: a premium men’s tailoring retailer with its own speakeasy. In other words, something like my idea of heaven. Maison Cloakroom is housed in a beautiful 19th-century townhouse on Rue de la Montagne in downtown Montreal. This place sums up that distinctive Montreal feel – old and new, European and American – more than anywhere else in the city.Meeting the makers at Lowell MTLLowell MTL may take its name from the region of Massachusetts that was once home to a large population of French Canadians (Jack Kerouac the most famous of them), but it is a Montreal brand to the core – all of its products take inspiration from locations in and around the city. Mathieu Mudie and Rachel Fortin, the husband and wife team behind Lowell MTL, made the brand’s name producing premium leather accessories, but they have since expanded into stylish men’s and women’s clothing ranges.The ultimate Reuben at Dunn’s FamousYou can’t leave Montreal without trying a classic smoked meat sandwich from one of the city’s famous delis. As with any local specialty, there’s always hot debate about who does the best, but it’s hard to imagine anywhere outdoing the full-fat, classic Reuben at Dunn’s Famous – a sandwich piled impossibly high with Dunn’s famous smoked brisket, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island sauce.Returning the favour at LovSometimes you just stumble upon one of the best places in town. That’s what happened with Lov. We found this place after taking a wrong turn en route to another restaurant. But it only took one look at what was coming out of the kitchen to convince us to stay – smart, innovative vegetarian dishes just asking to be washed down with one of Lov’s signature botanical cocktails. So good we returned the following night.By now I should have been used to just how close to nature you are in any Canadian city, but Vancouver takes it up a notch: from downtown you can be right on the water in 15 minutes walk. It’s something you can feel with the relaxed, west coast attitude of the people, and something that really comes through in the work of local makers Herschel and Dayton Boots, who have put Vancouver on the world style map.Colour and craftsmanship at the Museum of AnthropologySet deep in the leafy campus of the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology is home to a vast collection of indigenous artworks and cultural artefacts. I was lucky enough to have met Haida designer and artist Dorothy Grant at her home and studio before my visit – she gave me a real understanding of the varying colours and shapes used by different tribes. Seeing the level of craftsmanship on the totems, masks, garments and weaves on display up close was an experience I will never forget.Revolutionary fabrics at HerschelIt’s great to see such a young brand doing what it does so confidently. Herschel bags have made their mark so strongly as a street style staple since 2009 that, for me, they’ve become virtually synonymous with the idea of a rucksack. As a tailor, it was fascinating to see the work that the brand is doing in producing its own materials, such as the ApexKnit: a groundbreaking new fabric from which its makers are able to produce a single-piece rucksack.A fine legacy at Dayton BootsDayton Boots represents so much of what is great about Vancouver’s makers and the city’s style ethos. The brand started out more than 70 years ago, making boots for loggers. Today, their product is still as sturdy and well-crafted as it was then – but like so many great workwear brands, what they produce works just as well as a contemporary look. I’d recommend taking a look for yourself – the Dayton Boots factory is open to the public and right behind their flagship store on East Hastings Street.Record shopping and more in GastownGastown is home to one of the best record shops in the city – Beat Street Records, just around the corner from Gastown’s famous Steam clock.I’m a lover of jazz, funk and hip-hop and was blown away by the selections: among them releases by J-Dilla and Slum Village that I’d never come across in London, and hard-to-come-by rarities by Thelonious Monk and a load of other jazz greats. Of course, record shops aren’t the only thing you’ll find in Gastown. It’s a neighbourhood that has long been considered the spot for fine eating and drinking in Vancouver. Try Bao Down for some of Vancouver’s best Asian fusion street food.No more tacos after TacofinoAnd then there was Tacofino. What can I say about this place, other than is sells simply the finest tacos I’ve ever eaten. They were so good that I haven’t been able to find anything close since returning to London – it just feels like we’re not doing it right. But it’s not just the tacos – Tacofino also distinguishes itself with west coast-inspired ceviche, tostadas and nachos, as well as the phenomenal chilli salt wings with lime and valentina.The view to end all views, from the Sea to Sky GondolaIf you’re going to Vancouver, you have to take the Sea to Sky Gondola. It takes you over some of the most incredible natural scenery I saw in Canada, and it’s all less than an hour’s drive away from the city centre. The view from the summit was awe-inspiring, and many of the hiking trails coursing up the ascent were easily walkable for a beginner like me. It’s one of those places that makes you and your problems feel small – and all the better for it.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canadaPhotography: Momme Halbe and Taryn Paterson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceff7e56463a0fb27da6a6b2e75ae32d62b72f1e/154_293_3139_1883/master/3139.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd33673569bfbdc962bb3c5e00f67e89","title":"concussion loris karius liverpool goalkeeper champions league final massachusetts","story":"Loris Karius’s calamitous performance in the Champions League final could have been a result of concussion he sustained against Real Madrid, a doctor who assessed the Liverpool goalkeeper in Boston has said.Liverpool sent Karius for a head scan at Massachusetts General Hospital last Thursday amid concern at his reaction to a collision with Real’s captain, Sergio Ramos. The 24‑year‑old made two major errors that contributed to Real’s 3-1 victory. The first presented Karim Benzema with the opening goal and came soon after he received a blow to the head from Ramos as they challenged at the near post. Later Karius allowed Gareth Bale to put the contest beyond Liverpool with a long-range shot that squirmed through his hands.The German flew to the US on holiday after the final but Liverpool’s medical department was sufficiently concerned about the impact of Ramos’s challenge that it arranged a scan in Boston. Karius had a consultation with Dr Ross Zafonte, an authority on head-trauma injuries suffered by NFL players and the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Massachusetts General.A statement released on Monday by the hospital on Dr Zafonte’s behalf and with the player’s permission confirmed that Karius had been concussed.It read: “On May 31, 2018 Mr Karius underwent a comprehensive examination by Dr Ross Zafonte and Dr Lenore Herget in Boston at Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. After carefully reviewing game film and integrating a detailed history – including his reported present and immediate post-contact subjective symptoms – physical examination and objective metrics, we have concluded that Mr Karius sustained a concussion during the match 26\u0026nbspMay 2018.“At the time of our evaluation Mr Karius’s principal residual symptoms and objective signs suggested that visual spatial dysfunction existed and likely occurred immediately following the event.

For many, this summer will be all about skips, cement and the builder’s drill. For those planning home improvements, the key question will\u0026nbspbe where they can find a reliable tradesperson.Some 45,000 people called Citizens Advice last year seeking help with their home improvement and maintenance problems, and the Federation of Master Builders estimates cowboy contractors cost the UK economy £10bn a year.So which of the websites that vet traders should consumers turn to?On this commercial site, traders pay to quote for jobs posted by customers, who can then leave feedback about them. The identities and qualifications of traders who apply to join are verified, and data analysis tools are used to check they have not been banned in the past and that the reviews are by genuine customers.Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services. Traders have the right to reply, and a decision about whether to suspend their membership is made within 72 hours. “We get threatened with legal action all the time by traders, but we don’t bow into pressure to remove bad reviews,” says Peter Wellock, head of customer service.Another commercial site where traders pay to quote for jobs and the qualifications of those who apply to join are verified. Rated People speaks to every trader by phone or in person before they apply. One out of every four are blocked by its screening process, which includes fraud and credit checks. Those accepted typically pay £55 plus VAT per month on average, which allows them to quote for a limited number of jobs. Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services.Between five and 15 of the 90,000 jobs posted per month end in a dispute, says chief executive Celia Francis. “Often, the tradesperson will fix the problem and the customer will take the review down.” Sometimes, customer services will refer both parties to a mediation service, which costs each of them £25. The ultimate sanction is removal of membership.A commercial directory of 29,000 vetted traders who pay a minimum of £70 plus VAT per month to be listed. They have to pass a face-to-face interview and provide a minimum of five references. Qualifications and public liability insurance are examined, and background and identity checks carried out. All traders must agree to a code of conduct and allow Checkatrade to talk to Trading Standards about their work.Customers can review work online or via a Freepost postcard. Negative feedback is published within five days as long as reviewers give Checkatrade permission to contact the trader about the complaint. The tradesperson will then be allowed a right to reply and encouraged to put things right. The website may also decide to remove the trader from its directory.This is a non-profit, government-endorsed scheme intended to raise standards among tradespeople. Registered firms that are members of 32 recognised trade bodies and scheme operators, which have been vetted by TrustMark, can pay £40 a year to display its logo and be listed on the website. Currently, around 12,500 businesses are on the site.Traders have to sign up to a code of conduct and undergo background checks on their identity and business. They will also receive an on-site inspection at their place of business and at a site where they have carried out work.Work quality is checked by an expert, so users do not need to rely on reviews from other customers, says chief executive Simon Ayers. Those with complaints will be able to take up their issue with the trader and their scheme operator.An independent, not-for-profit directory of 3,550 vetted traders, run by Trading Standards and supported by 56 local authorities. Only those who have been trading for at least six months may pay £125 plus VAT to apply to be listed. A Trading Standards officer will then audit the business. Background and financial checks are done to look for criminal convictions. Previous customers are randomly selected for\u0026nbspreferences, although the work is not inspected.The website has access to a Trading Standards database and can check traders aren’t generating complaints to Citizens Advice, says the directory’s operations manager, Rachael Holden.Any claims traders make about their business or qualifications are verified. Only traders who pass this audit and have a complaints procedure can join.Which site works best? All five were tested with a search to “refresh my garden” in Cambridge so that costs could be\u0026nbspcompared.No one on MyBuilder wanted to quote and only one Rated People gardener, who was not affiliated to any scheme and did not list any qualifications on his website, offered a quote but wanted to visit the garden.When called, he said he charged £180 a day for labour and was available to start in two weeks. When the job was not offered to him, he called back two hours later to stress he had\u0026nbsp“bought” the job from Rated People. He had 15 five-star ratings out of 15 possible reviews.The Checkatrade directory gave details of two firms within five miles that had been given feedback in the past month. Both had more than 50 reviews and scores of 9.8 and 9.9 out of 10. The first refused to give a quote without visiting the garden, but promised a gardener would then be available to do the work within two weeks. The second quoted £350 per day for two people’s labour, but was booked up until\u0026nbspSeptember.On TrustMark, a trader who was a member of the Association of Professional Landscapers, the Horticultural Trades Association and Buy With Confidence quoted £320 to £350 per day for two people’s labour over the phone, but said he was booked up until early next year.The closest Buy With Confidence landscape gardener, who was a member of the Gardeners Guild and the Countryside Management Association, and a Green Flag Awards judge, said he was too busy to take on any work until next year.Visiting all five directories, reading the reviews, checking out inidual websites and qualifications, and making phone calls took well over an hour but achieved little. In the end, it was a relief that a landscape gardener was not needed after all. The ideal trader would have been both a member of TrustMark and Buy With Confidence whose work had been inspected by an expert in their field, as well as being a business approved by a Trading Standards officer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd907d235232c8ebcbce339ff3460facfc0160fa/67_452_3982_2389/master/3982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0b2f7313e51abfcf54b53e32b5c2db","title":"clarity on brexit plan now urgent business bosses tell theresa may","story":"Executives at No 10 business advisory council ask for more information to adequately prepare for trade post-BrexitBusiness chiefs have warned Theresa May that they urgently needed clarity on the government’s plans for Brexit to help them prepare their companies after the UK leaves the European Union in just 10 months.After a meeting of the prime minister’s business advisory council at No 10, which included leading firms Tesco, GlaxoSmithKline and BAE Systems, executives suggested that they needed more information on issues such as customs arrangements.However, it has emerged that the government’s Brexit white paper, which was expected to be published within weeks, could be delayed until after the crunch EU summit at the end of June. The delay of the document, which was intended to put the UK on the front foot in negotiations but is said to still be “riddled with red ink”, underlines the deep ides that continue to exist in cabinet over customs plans and the Irish border. May’s spokesman was unable to say whether the white paper, expected to include detail on areas including financial services, security and dispute settlement, would be ready by the Brussels summit. “I’ve not put a timeframe on it, other than we will bring it forward as soon as possible,” he said.No 10 said the June summit was simply a “staging post” towards Brexit while other government sources suggested that the EU would primarily be seeking progress on the so-called backstop option.Edwin Morgan, head of media relations at the Institute of Directors, which was represented at the talks, added: “Businesses need clarity about the government’s objectives to help them to plan. Everything is still subject to negotiation with the EU, but we don’t yet know what the UK will pushing for in key areas like customs. “Our members want to know whether the government’s forthcoming white paper will make clear their intentions on VAT, customs and regulatory alignment – to understand in what areas ministers foresee continued harmonisation with EU rules, and where they want freedom to erge.”It has been reported that the UK may seek to stay inside the EU’s VAT area after Brexit, which would require the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, one of May’s red lines.The business leaders were also said to have warned the prime minister that maintaining frictionless trade with the EU after Brexit was probably more important than the imposition of any tariffs.After the meeting, a No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister provided an update on the negotiations … setting out plans to provide greater detail of the future relationship in a white paper due to be published shortly. “The business representatives expressed their support for this approach, which will build on information provided through the prime minister’s various speeches.“Brexit secretary David Davis, chancellor Philip Hammond, business secretary Greg Clark and trade secretary Liam Fox were also at the meeting. Meanwhile the prime minister will attempt to overturn all 15 of the House of Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill in one sitting when it returns tothe Commons next week.May will aim to get her flagship Brexit legislation through in just 12 hours next Tuesday with MPs warned they will be voting into the early hours.Conservative MPs have been told by their chief whip to be on site “at all times” for the votes, with party managers fearing they could face several defeats.The prime minister is reliant on the Democratic Unionist party to push through her Brexit agenda, but could struggle to overturn key amendments including on themeaningful vote and the customs union, although the wording of thiswould not necessitate a shift in policy.The Labour whips’ office criticised the move in a comment on Twitter, saying that holding all of the votes on one day was “an absolute disgrace” and “must be out of sheer panic”.It added that the Commons “has had nothing to do for months in terms of substantive business and to try to ram through in one day shows the contempt that the government have for the role of parliament”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd583af559a32f99f31e0100e988f6018e895d39/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9669ed7f27d5a5d6fc92b76a1cdbc021","title":"jeremy corbyn calls for investigation alleged islamophobia conservative party","story":"Labour leader, Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi and the Muslim Council of Britain press resistant home secretaryJeremy Corbyn has called for an inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservative party.The Tories have been under pressure since the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for an investigation, highlighting a range of claims including candidates and other representatives allegedly having far-right connections or sending offensive tweets.The Labour leader backed calls for an investigation on Monday night after home secretary Sajid Javid rejected the proposition of an inquiry, which gained support from Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi.The new home secretary is the first BAME holder of one of the great offices of state, a former investment banker and Margaret Thatcher devotee who is on the right of the Conservative party. His appointment will keep the balance of EU leavers and remainers in the top offices, but only just. Javid backed remain, but with some hesitation.Born in Rochdale in 1969, he is – like the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan – a Muslim son of a bus driver who has risen to the top of British politics. His parents were born in India, but fled to Pakistan. His father arrived in Britain in the 1960s – Javid has said he came with £1 in his pocket.After leaving banking for politics in 2010, the MP for Bromsgrove rose quickly, beginning as parliamentary private secretary to George Osborne before continuing as a protege of the former chancellor in junior roles at the Treasury.He got his first cabinet job in just his fourth year in parliament when he was appointed culture secretary in 2014, and was appointed business secretary after the 2015 election.After an abortive attempt with his friend\u0026nbspStephen Crabb to mount a bid for the leadership, where he would have been chancellor, he took the communities brief under Theresa May. His biggest challenge has been the Grenfell Tower disaster, where the government has faced criticism for stalling on promises to the victims’ families.“I think if there are allegations made then an inquiry should be held and it should be addressed and it should be dealt with,” Corbyn told the Press Association at a west London mosque.“Islamophobia, as with antisemitism, as with any other form of racism, has no place whatsoever in our society or in any of our political parties. Nobody should be condoning it, nobody should be hiding it, everybody should be exposing it.”He highlighted reported rises of Islamophobic hate crimes, and added: “Let’s dedicate ourselves, during Ramadan, to say we will drive out Islamophobia from our society.”Corbyn was speaking at al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in Westbourne Park after an evening meal for Muslims to end their daily Ramadan fast.The opposition leader has himself come under pressure over allegations of antisemitism in his own party, leading Theresa May, the prime minister, to accuse him of allowing it to “run rife”.The MCB general secretary Harun Rashid Khan last week wrote to the Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis, saying there had been “more than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia” by Tory figures in April.Khan also highlighted Zac Goldsmith’s unsuccessful bid against Labour’s Sadiq Khan to become mayor of London in 2016, claiming there had been no action against those responsible for “shocking Islamophobia” during the campaign.Rejecting the calls for an inquiry, Javid told the Andrew Marr Show the MCB did not represents Muslims in the UK.He added: “I would be very suspicious of anything that they’ve got to say, not least because under the last Labour government and a policy continued by us, we don’t deal with the MCB and we don’t deal with it because too many of their members have had, you know, comments on extremists and that’s not acceptable.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6619256c9dd33ee152f75d3b824fd8ff7cae15/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac0d7b5fddf69b638aa83dcbf8fbb82","title":"did you solve it world cup arithmetic","story":"The solutions to today’s puzzlesOn my puzzle blog earlier today I set you three football table challenges:1) England, Tunisia, Belgium and Panama make up Group G in the 2018 World Cup. Imagine that once they have all played each other the table looks like this.If you know only that England beat Tunisia 3-0, can you deduce the score of every other match in the group?(For non football fans: the F column is “goals for”, meaning how many goals the team scored in total, the A column is “goals against”, meaning how many goals the team conceded in total, and the P column is “points”, when 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss.)EXTRA CLARIFICATION: Some readers pointed out that Belgium should be above Tunisia in the table, because goal difference is the tie-break when two teams are equal on points. This observation is correct, but does not affect the puzzle. The reason that the error crept in is that I updated the puzzle from one written in 1921 when there must have been a different criterion for the tie-break. Thanks to everyone who spotted the mistake.We know by looking at the points that England won all three games, Tunisia and Belgium both won, drew and lost a game, and Panama lost all three games. Let’s consider Tunisia, which lost to England 3-0. Tunisia must have beaten Panama (since everyone did) and therefore drawn with Belgium, scoring 2 goals and conceding 0 across these two games. The only way this combination is possible is if they won 2-0, and drew 0-0, since if they scored a goal in the draw with Belgium, they would have conceded another goal, which we know they didn’t since they only conceded 3 in total. So far we have:And the games left areEngland conceded only one goal. Panama scored only one goal. Let’s assume that the goal scored by Panama was conceded by England. In that case, Belgium did not score against England. So Belgium must have scored 3 goals against Panama. We know that Tunisia scored 2 against Panama. But that means that England can only have scored a single goal against Panama, since Panama only conceded 6. Yet our assumption was that Panama scored a goal against England, meaning this match would have been a draw, which we know is incorrect. We conclude that our assumption was wrong, and that the goal scored by Panama was against Belgium, and the goal conceded by England was also scored by Belgium. So, of Belgium’s three goals, one was against England. The other two must have been against Panama, since they won that game despite conceding a goal. Thus Belgium beat Panama 2-1. Panama conceded 6 in total, so England beat Panama 2-0, and beat Belgium 2-1.I’m only going to give you a sketch of how to solve this one. First, you need to know that the goals for and the goals column must always be equal. Since Slovakia has a goal difference of zero, the goals they scored are equal to the goals they conceded. Which means that the goals the other three teams scored are equal to the goals the other three teams conceded. Thus Wales and Russia conceded one goal each. Next, looking at the order of the teams, you can work out how many of the games each team must have won, drawn and lost, and once you have that you can work out the exact scores. For example England are top but they cannot have won all three games, since you cannot win all three games and have a negative goal difference. Here’s the full table.3. I asked if it was possible to design a football table puzzle in which only a single number is given and from which we can deduce every single result between the teams. (Assume that all matches have been played). I think the only possible answer is if the team that is in first place has a 0 in the “goals for” slot. Since from this we can deduce that every match must have ended 0-0. This means all teams are on 3 points. If this were a World Cup group, there would be a tie-break to determine who comes top, which under current rules are be Fair Play points. It is the null solution...but still interesting that we can deduce all the results from a single number. Does anyone know if there has ever been a four-team group in any major competition with only 0-0 results?I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles.

He said it was the only one of its species to have been discovered.A dinosaur expert, Eric Geneste, had previously said it was impossible to classify the skeleton as an allosaurus because it was more robust, with longer shoulder blades and a different number of teeth. “There are as many differences between it and an allosaurus as between a human and a gorilla,” he said.Japanese and Swedish telephone bidders also tried to buy the bones, pushing the bidding above the €1.8m estimate.In 2016, the French auction house sold an allosaurus, called Kan, for €1.1m. Mickeler said: “Herbivores do not quite excite businessmen who buy dinosaurs the same way as carnivores do.

According to fresh calculations, a day on Earth was a full five hours and fifteen minutes shorter a billion or so years ago, well before complex life spread around the planet.Scientists used a combination of astronomical theory and geochemical signatures buried in ancient rocks to show that 1.4bn years ago the Earth turned a full revolution on its axis every 18 hours and 41 minutes.The number means that, on average, the length of the day on Earth has grown by approximately one 74 thousandth of a second per year since Precambrian times, a trend that is expected to continue for millions, if not billions, of years more. As the Earth’s rotation gradually winds down, the moon moves further away. Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stephen Meyers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Alberto Malinverno at Columbia University in New York calculate that over the past 1.4bn years the moon has drifted about 44,000km from Earth to a distance of 384,400km.Meyers and Malinvern set themselves the task of reconstructing changes in the distance between the Earth and the moon, and variations in Earth’s orbit, along with wobbles and tilts known as Milankovitch cycles, further back in time than ever before. Until now, it has been hard to work out reliable figures for more than 50m years ago.Because Milankovitch cycles affect how much sun reaches the planet’s poles, they are prime drivers of climate change over timescales ranging from tens of thousands of years to millions of years. To pin down the frequency of the cycles in Earth’s deep history, the scientists looked at copper and aluminium ratios linked to climate change in the 1.4bn-year-old Xiamaling marine sediment in northern China, and the 55 m-year-old Walvis ridge in the south Atlantic, and fed these into a model.“We were interested in reconstructing the Milankovitch cycles because they provide a powerful tool for evaluating the history of our planet, and the solar system. They are like signposts on a trail, allowing us to navigate geological history,” said Meyers. “For example, the identification of Milankovitch cycles in sediments ning the past million years has revolutionised our understanding of the nature of ice ages, the instability of ice sheets, and how Earth’s climate system works.”As for the moon, it will not retreat from Earth forever. At some point in the far future, it will reach a stable distance when it will be visible only from one half of Earth, and never seen from the other.

Six years later he believes the home team are on the rise and will grow stronger under the command of the former Munster head coach Rassie Erasmus.“I think it’s a tough tour this year,” said Lancaster, one of the key architects of Leinster’s historic European and Pro14 double success last season.“Rassie Erasmus, who I’ve coached against at Munster, will do a great job in galvanising the South Africans. And the person people haven’t talked about much is Jacques Nienaber, who was the defence coach at Munster. He’s a very good defence coach. If you get those South Africans organised defensively, irrespective of their attack, then it’s a tough series.”Lancaster said he can still “vividly” remember the first quarter of England’s previous visit to Ellis Park six years ago, when the Springboks made such a storming start to the second Test that they were 22-3 ahead with an hour of the game still left. “After about 20 minutes this wave of green shirts was crashing over us,” Lancaster recalled. “You’re thinking: ‘Oh my God, this could be 40 or 50.’South Africa’s rugby fortunes have subsequently declined with numerous top players opting to sign with overseas clubs, but Erasmus has included Wasps’ Willie le Roux, Sale’s Faf de Klerk, Duane Vermuelen of Toulon and the Montpellier duo Frans Steyn and Bismarck du Plessis in his squad for the England games.Lancaster still thinks that Jones’s side have the potential to win the series – “I wouldn’t read too much into the Six Nations, it came down to small margins in the end” – but suspects the home side will be sharply improved.“I watched South Africa play here in November and Ireland beat them 38-3. What has changed is that Rassie will bring back some players from overseas. If you put the best SA team together it’s a formidable team, and then you layer on their sense of pride in the shirt.”Jamie George, meanwhile, has admitted Dylan Hartley will be missed in the South Africa series as he prepares for a first extended run in the No\u0026nbsp2 jersey. George has started in only two of his 25 England appearances but is in line for another three against the Springboks with Hartley, whose first game as the national captain was that 2012 draw in Port Elizabeth, missing out on the tour due to concussion.“I have to try and drive the standards within the team because Dylan was brilliant at that and we are definitely missing that side of things,” George said. “Filling those shoes will be difficult, but also something I relish. But I also want to make sure I put my own spin on it.”George also expects his close friend and Saracens team-mate Owen Farrell to flourish as Hartley’s replacement as captain. “What I have learnt with him is that the more responsibility he gets, the better he gets as a player and as a leader,” he said. “He relishes the challenge and he is a brilliant captain. At 19-20 he was hot-headed but he has learnt that isn’t the way all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1de1a859c50a1b0ca217bb163cc1125084e9403/220_247_1758_1055/master/1758.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e63da5dff29c74b0a3ea6bcfae657e66","title":"jos buttler test rediscovery england cricket one day specialist","story":"England one-day specialist is a thinker about the game and even at the age of 27 there is plenty of time remaining for him to have a decent Test careerA cricketer’s life is a short one and so evolution is consequently rapid. A fresh-faced bright young thing surfaces amid great excitement and curiosity suddenly they somehow evolve into an established international cricketer and then after minimal blinking there is the gnarled old pro maybe pondering a career as a coach or a pundit once the playing days are gone. It all happens so fast.Imperceptibly Jos Buttler seems to have arrived at that middle stage. He is 27 now he has played 190 times for England, 20 of which have been in Test cricket, and since his return to the red-ball game has so far proven to be a damn fine idea, the chances of him resuming as a three-format cricketer are now excellent.He is not yet gnarled, but it is almost seven years since he first played for England in a Twenty20 match against India at Old Trafford. The management team increasingly seek his opinion – with good reason. For such an instinctive, free-spirited batsman, Buttler thinks seriously about the game.The past fortnight has prompted Buttler’s career to swerve in an exciting direction – for him and for those who treasure Test cricket. The manner in which he changed gear on Sunday morning, from dutiful Test batsman to devastating destroyer, made for compelling viewing.His success in two Tests against Pakistan has suggested, contrary to the age-old mantras, that it is possible to swerve from T20 to Test cricket without any intervening period of rehabilitation in the longer game – provided you are blessed with exceptional talent and a clear mind. Before the match at Lord’s Buttler mentioned that he felt as if he was making another debut after his 18-month absence from Test cricket and he returned to that theme after the game at Headingley.Chris Woakes has joined Ben Stokes on the injury sidelines for England’s first one-day international of the summer against Scotland on Sunday.Woakes, who will be replaced by Tom Curran in the squad to play in Edinburgh, left the field at Headingley on Sunday with a thigh injury. An ECB statement read: “Woakes will be assessed this week to ascertain if he’ll be fit for the Australia series.” Curran has eight ODI caps and was part of the team which won in New Zealand three months ago. Jos Buttler is to be rested for Sunday’s game. “My mentality has been similar to my first few Tests, not worrying about external factors, just trying to play the game and trusting myself‚“ he said. “But the big difference is experience,” he said. “When I was a young player I didn’t really believe in experience when the older guys told me I would improve or understand things in time. I used to think you could either do it or you couldn’t. But now I understand how valuable experience is, not only on the field but in the stuff that goes on beyond it.”Buttler excelled with the bat at the start of his Test career before petering out and he can now rationalise why. “I started to think too much about how not to get out as opposed to how to score runs and I got into a really bad rut. The only way out of it was to be dropped, which actually released a lot of pressure.”This is a point worth remembering for selectors. Rather than being consumed by giving someone countless chances in an effort to be fair, it is worth recalling how a cricketer can benefit from being dropped and having the space to reassess.Buttler has returned to Test cricket via the white-ball game. In particular his form in the Indian Premier League this spring enabled him to start a Test with confidence high, even if his surprise selection also represented a voyage of discovery – or rediscovery.“The IPL gave me huge amounts of confidence, to be in those pressure situations in India, in front of big crowds and being one of the overseas players‚” he said. “For me, not trying to worry about the colour of the ball definitely helps.”He explains some of the different demands of T20 and Test cricket. “In T20 there’s generally another game around the corner. You’re almost set up to fail a lot of the time, especially if you’re batting in the middle order. The tough thing with Test cricket is that if you get out early you’ve got a long time to think about it.“You guys have to write about it the Sky commentators have to fill time and they can pick you to pieces. In T20 you just move on to another game two days later. In cricket you fail in your head maybe seven or eight times out of 10. You’re always dealing with failure, which makes it such a tough game to master mentally.”Buttler clearly understands how precarious the game can be and he would never claim to have cracked it. “I’ve only played two Test matches coming back so I’m not going to get too far ahead of myself.”His globetrotting on the T20 circuit over the past two years has also helped him. “I haven’t been kicking my heels, saying I’m a failure in Test cricket and regretting how it went.” But unlike Adil Rashid and Alex Hales, he has not been tempted to rule out returning to the most taxing form of the game, for which England are very grateful. Even in the helter-skelter world of the modern cricketer there is still time enough for Buttler to have a significant Test career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c54bdc967c0e191ad3da7737b9c8e5641e8ba8c/157_391_4382_2630/master/4382.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b133b55879c802b7ffbba5beff012b37","title":"us pga tour deal marginalises sky sports discovery","story":"Sky Sports faces a battle to retain its status as the UK’s main broadcaster of the PGA Tour after a $2bn deal was announced between the golfing body and Discovery. Sky’s hold on rights has already been weakened by the loss last year of the PGA Championship, plus an ongoing battle with Augusta National regarding the Masters.The PGA Tour confirmed on Monday that all broadcast rights outside of the country will be handled in partnership with Discovery – the media conglomerate which controls Eurosport – from 2019 until 2030. The announcement covers 21 markets, including Australia, South Korea and\u0026nbspCanada.Sky’s contract to screen PGA Tour events runs until 2022, meaning nothing will change immediately. It must decide in the meantime whether to attempt a sub-licence agreement with what is essentially a direct rival or step back from one of its core sports.It opted not to comment on the news as revealed jointly from PGA Tour bases in New York and London, with insiders keen to point out the time due to run on the existing contract. Discovery has the potential to auction coverage on a territory‑by‑territory basis. A senior PGA Tour source would confirm only that the UK market will be “open to negotiation” in the future.Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said: “This is an exciting next step which presents a tremendous opportunity to accelerate and expand our media business outside the United States, better service our international broadcast partners, and drive fan growth with a deeply experienced strategic global partner.“Since 2007, the PGA Tour has negotiated all of its non-US broadcast rights deals on its own. The alliance between Discovery and the PGA Tour will capitalise on the two organisations’ expertise in managing international multi-platform rights and launching the new digital service.”The European Tour has an agreement with Sky which concludes at the end of this year. Keith Pelley, its chief executive and a former media executive in Canada, is known to be seeking as broad a platform as possible amid concerns about golf’s popularity with\u0026nbspyoungsters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfc24160c10d13445038b9e584099cc4b5217f5/0_132_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be6a96f4d9484f8c6a6eca91a6a5294a","title":"apple ios12 screen time apps how much spent phone digital wellbeing","story":"‘Screen Time’ app show how long you spend on each app and lets people set daily limitsApple has unveiled digital wellbeing tools to help people reduce the time they spend glued to their screens.A new app called Screen Time will offer iPhone and iPad users a dashboard highlighting how much time they have spent using which apps, how many notifications they receive, how often they pick up their device and how their usage patterns compare to the average.The app also lets users set daily time limits for inidual apps, and a notification will be shown when the time limit is about to expire. Parents will be able to access their children’s activity reports from their own devices to understand and manage their browsing habits.“Some apps send us flurries of notifications trying to draw us in for fear of missing out,” said Apple’s senior vice-president of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, speaking to a 6,000-strong audience at WWDC, Apple’s annual developer conference, at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose on Monday. “For some of us it’s become such a habit we don’t even recognise just how distracted we’ve become.”Screen Time will be available with iOS 12, the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, which launches later this year.Other digital wellbeing features to launch with iOS 12 include enhancements to the “do not disturb” feature, including a bedtime mode that dims the display and hides all notifications from the lock screen until prompted in the morning.The new operating system will also let users control how notifications are delivered to reduce interruptions, including the ability to group together notifications or turn them off completely. Apple’s virtual assistant Siri will also make suggestions for notification settings based on which alerts people act upon.The focus on digital wellbeing comes at a time when technology companies including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple are being scrutinised for their use of habit-forming design practices that encourage people to spend more time on their devices, such as infinite scrolling, notifications and other behavioural “nudges”.Apple’s tools are very similar to those announced by Google last month at its own annual developer conference, Google IO. The latest version of Google’s mobile operating system, Android P, also comes with an “app dashboard” which allows users to set time limits on inidual apps as well as a wind-down mode before bedtime that stops notifications and turns the screen to greyscale.The company also doubled down on its commitment to privacy with the introduction of tools to prevent advertisers from tracking users of Apple devices from being tracked online.In a direct swipe at Facebook, Federighi explained how “like buttons and share buttons” and comment features can “be used to track you whether you click on them or not”.“This year we’re shutting that down,” he said, adding that people can interact with these features if they choose to, but they won’t be tracked by default on an Apple computer if they use the native Safari browser on the next version of its desktop operating system, macOS Mojave.The company is also clamping down on a technique called “fingerprinting” which allows advertisers to identify and track inidual web users based on the unique way their computer is set up, including the device, operating system and fonts they are using.“Mass deployment of fingerprinting protection is a game-changer for privacy engineering, and for users,” said Dr Lukasz Olejnik, independent security and privacy researcher and consultant.This builds on Apple’s efforts announced in 2017 to restrict web cookies, which also allow advertising companies to track users across the internet.“Put simply, there are two big classes of tracking: cookies and fingerprinting,” added Olejnik. “It appears that Apple has set a goal to go after all techniques that may be used in third-party tracking. It’s an arms race and I believe Apple may be winning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48f9af1fd938147d2d0a523ebc693ceff1b52605/0_22_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92c3ff913cae0c3f79d43289b8e26fbb","title":"philippine president criticised for kissing woman on stage","story":"Rodrigo Duterte accused of ‘despicable display of sexism and grave abuse of authority’The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, has been criticised for kissing a married woman in front of thousands of cheering supporters.Duterte, 73, dismissed the kiss as a “gimmick” to entertain supporters at a meet-and-greet event with overseas Filipino workers in South Korea on Sunday evening. But one senator called the act “a despicable display of sexism and grave abuse of authority”.Duterte sought a kiss from the woman after he called her on stage to give her a copy of a book at the event in Seoul. When Duterte asked if she could explain to her husband that the antic was just a joke, and she said yes, the president leaned in and kissed her as thousands erupted in cheers.The scene was broadcast live by the state-run TV network to the Philippines.The woman has defended the kiss and said she was thrilled by her encounter but others said the president went too far.“President Duterte acted like a feudal king who thinks that being the president is an entitlement to do anything that he pleases,” said Sen Risa Hontiveros. “Even if the act was consensual, it was the president, possessed of awesome, even intimidating, power, who initiated it.”Gabriela, a leftwing women’s party, condemned Duterte’s act, which it said underscored his “machismo and misogyny”. In addition to growing alarm over his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs, which has left thousands of mostly poor drug suspects dead, Duterte has come under fire from women’s groups for sexist remarks, including one where he told troops to shoot female insurgents “in the vagina” during a public outburst against communist guerrillas.He has publicly kissed women in the past, included at rallies during his campaign for the presidency.The latest incident came near the end of a two-hour rambling speech, when Duterte offered the crowd a book about alleged corruption and abuse in the Catholic church. He pointed at two women.“There’s payment for this, a kiss. You in white, are you ready to engage in kissing? Come here,” the 73-year-old Duterte said as summoned the women to the stage.One of the women gave the president a peck on the cheek. The other woman reached for the president’s hand and put it on her forehead in a traditional gesture of respect for an elder. But the president asked her to come closer for a kiss, pointing to his lips.Amid the roar of the crowd, Duterte asked the woman was married and if her husband was around. He inquired if she could explain to her husband that what they were about to do was just a joke.She said her husband was not there and replied yes to the president’s other question.“Make him jealous,” the president said.Duterte then leaned in and kissed the visibly overwhelmed woman, who screamed in joy and covered her face. He then hugged her.“Don’t take that seriously,” Duterte later told the crowd. “It’s just to give people fun.”The woman, who is married to a South Korean and has two daughters, later said in a TV interview that she was thrilled by her encounter with the president. She said there was “no malice” in the kiss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2c1bf8bc510f7a89767644609c6c5abf716111/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c255d3a7c592e951c4ff98e384a218","title":"guatemalas fuego volcano erupts in pictures","story":"At least 25 people have been killed and nearly 300 injured in the most violent eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano in more than 40 years, officials said.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Wednesday sees the beginning of the written papers in this year’s Junior and Leaving Cert exams.In both cases, students will sit English exams in the morning. In the case of Leaving Cert students, their paper one will be followed by paper two on Thursday afternoon.For Junior Cert students, the sole English paper of two hours’ duration is the second-ever written paper under the reformed junior cycle. In previous years, students would have sat two English papers.Whereas junior cycle students will have written papers morning and afternoon over the first three days of the exams, Leaving Cert students will get some breaks over the next three days, as home economics, engineering and geography papers are scheduled on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, alongside English papers one and two, and maths paper one.What is the most important thing to do to prepare?Organise all your revision notes for all the examination papers. Try organising them backwards, starting from your last exam, identifying the periods of time you have available before each paper to finally review your notes and sample answers.When you have completed this process, you will have a clear picture of how you are going to use every hour available to you it will help you make sure all sections of every paper have identified time slots for final revision. Undertaking this simple process will give you back a sense of control over the exam and reduce excess stress.What should I do each morning before leaving for school?Remember, different papers require you to have different instruments and materials.Check your other daily requirements such as fluids, other forms of nourishment, bus fares where appropriate, and so on. You may also wish to take a set of revision cards with you for each day’s papers. Just make sure to leave them outside the exam hall.How should I manage the first 15 minutes of English on Wednesday morning?When you sit into your seat, arrange your pens and other implements on your desk.When the invigilator arrives at your desk, he or she will offer you your paper. Always opt for the paper you have prepared for. Never attempt to change levels at the last minute as this is always a negative side effect of exam nerves.Once you receive your paper, read it carefully and fully before you do anything else.Start to sketch out, at the back of your answer book, the answers to every question you are planning to answer.You will not be able to fully complete this task in the first 15 minutes, as your memory will need to work on many questions over the period of the entire examination.When you have completed this process to the best of your ability, start working on the question you feel most comfortable with.How do I get the maximum out of the paper before I hand it up?If at the end of your last question you still have a few minutes left until you must hand up your paper, you can try to increase your mark by at least 5 per cent.Simply go back over every question and re-read what you have written. Your first attempt at writing a piece is always improved by re-reading what you have written.Also, try to leave at least ½ page free at the end of each question so you can add extra material – if you want to – at the end of the exam. New ideas will occur to you as you read back your answer. Don’t bother trying to erase any written content. Just draw a line through any incorrect material, and add the new content at the end of that page. If you don’t have space, just put it at the end of the answer book and clearly mark it.How can parents help their children get through the next few weeks?Know the exam schedule. Pin the timetable up prominently at home, with each exam to be taken highlighted.If you don’t have a copy of the schedule you can download it and print it from the State Exams Commission website on examinations.ie. In the stress of the whole exam period, you need to be always aware when your children must be at the examination centre."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519237.1528130281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"grade expectations meet our exam diarists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCarndonagh Community School students EJ Gibbons, Tara Kelly, Dylan Donegan, Sarah Monagle, Callum Doherty and Jade Simpson who will be sharing their Leaving Cert highs and lows. Photograph: North West NewspixThis year, students from Carndonagh Community School in Donegal will share their experience of the Leaving Cert in The  each day, as well as their hopes, dreams and fears for the future.The road to Ireland’s most northerly school passes through the city of Derry before winding through the stunning Inishowen peninsula along the disputed territory of Lough Foyle.“Inishowen is one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland but has suffered due to its remoteness from Dublin and its proximity to the Border and the Troubles,” says Paul Fiorentini, principal of Carndonagh Community School. “It is a major source of frustration to us that every year we send off another crop of talented pupils who are unlikely to ever come back.“We need Government support to open up the northwest. The loss of the plane link from Derry to Dublin in the recession was a major blow. We need the A5 as a matter of urgency.”Emigration is the lot of most young people from Carndonagh. Last month, the county as a whole narrowly voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment. The No vote in Donegal reflects the reality that significant numbers of young people from Donegal voted Yes in Dublin, Galway or Sligo, because they have been forced to leave their home county for work.Only the economic nexus of Letterkenny-Derry provides any real local chances. However, Derry suffered during the recession and some of its citizens are growing increasingly frustrated at what they see as a focus on Belfast at the expense of the Maiden City (on the other hand, house prices there are significantly cheaper than in Dublin or Belfast).Carndonagh CS – known locally (in a Donegal accent) as “The Cairn” – was founded in 1973 following the amalgamation of three local schools and is a multi-denominational and co-educational school with a Christian ethos.At its height, it had more than 1,600 pupils and was the largest school in Ireland. Numbers have fallen from 1,530 in 2000 to 1,027 today – plus about 80 teachers – but it remains one of the largest schools in the State.While Carndonagh itself is a tight-knit community of just under 2,500 people, young people are bussed in to the school from across the wider Inis peninsula. The local nightclub, Tul Na Rí, is a popular spot for young people right across Inishowen.“Distance permeates our lives,” says Fiorentini. “If we get sick, it is a 40-mile trip to Letterkenny, or if we are sicker, off to Galway or Dublin. If we are to engage beyond the school gates, then travel is a major consideration.”The school is perhaps the remotest in Ireland: the nearest railway station in the Republic is over two hours away, in Sligo.Just across the Border is a rail link connecting Derry to Dublin via Belfast. The road journey to Dublin can, at peak times, take five hours. Many of the pupils here come from small farming backgrounds, there is little if any industrial employment left in the area and the fishing industry is in decline.Brexit represents a serious threat to the already precarious future of the peninsula.“It could be catastrophic for us. I remember what a hard border was like and the complications it introduced. It could be a real stimulus to extremists. We have several staff living in Derry, and to leave Donegal we have to go through Northern Ireland.”Despite challenges outside its control, the school is a hive of activity, recently winning the Irish schools senior soccer championship.Graduates are found throughout Irish third-levels, especially Letterkenny IT and Northwest College in Derry. The school is enthusiastically embracing the new junior cycle curriculum which emphasises a more dynamic relationship with learning, says the principal.Only one of our diarists, Callum Doherty, sees a long-term future for himself in Carndonagh, and he hopes that the roll-out of broadband nationwide will provide him with the chance to build a life and career for himself in his home town.But, as evidenced by talking to our diarists, Donegal’s young people look out beyond their county boundary, to the rest of the island and over to Europe. “Our future is connected with Europe and we are European in outlook,” says Fiorentini.“We welcome children from all over the world and we participate in the BeLongTo LGBT Stand up week. We may live on a peninsula, but we refuse to be insular.”Tara (18) hopes to study physiotherapy at UCD, with sport science as a possible back-up option.Her favourite subjects are English and biology, and her least favourite are maths and history. Her top study tip is to read notes out loud and to use flashcards.Tara’s biggest worry is not getting the points she needs and having to repeat the exams, and she is most excited by the possibilities of being young. She is not particularly worried about Brexit but is concerned that her ability to travel may be curtailed by border checks.Repeat student Callum (19) wants to become a journalist and is particularly interested in sports and in scriptwriting.He has applied for the bachelor of arts at NUI Galway and hopes to study history and politics before later considering a journalism masters. He has already contributed articles to local newspaper, the Inish Times.Callum’s hobbies include sport and socialising. His favourite subjects are history and English, while his least favourite are Irish, Spanish and accounting.After the Leaving Cert, he hopes to visit his brother in the US, but he worries about Trump’s policies and behaviour.He finds talking to friends useful for study. He says Brexit is “stupid” but doesn’t believe that there will ultimately be a hard border, with “all the tension it would bring”.Sarah, 18, is still undecided about what to study in college and has applied for general entry at UCD, but she may still change her mind.Her favourite subject is biology her least favourite is English. When studying, she reads, memorises and says the information out loud, and she also uses flashcards.She worries about job security and extreme weather, although she is excited about her own future independence and hopes to own a house in the future. She doesn’t really see herself returning to live in Carndonagh after college, but isn’t dead-set against it either.As for Brexit, she says the British don’t seem to know what they want, but she doesn’t think the fallout will be as bad as some fear.EJ (17) hopes to become a doctor and has applied to Trinity and the Royal College of Surgeons.He loves reading and sport and is a member of Buncrana Boxing Club. His favourite subjects are Spanish and biology, and his least favourite is Irish. When studying, he reads the information, rewrites it and breaks it into chunks where possible.He worries about finding a job but is not bothered by the likelihood of having to emigrate and, indeed, says that he is excited by the prospect of living abroad and travelling the world.He doesn’t really follow the twists and turns of Brexit but points out that thousands of people cross the Border freely every day and that Derry is a major hub for entertainment and shopping.Dylan (17) plays piano and has received a conditional acceptance to the DIT Conservatory of Music, with Maynooth University as a back-up.His favourite subjects are music and Irish and his least favourite is biology. Practice and essay-writing are among his preferred study methods. He’d like to become a music teacher and doesn’t really see himself settling long-term in Carndonagh.Dylan is excited by the prospect of independence. He thinks Brexit will be resolved and that the worst-case scenario will not play out.Jade comes from a large family and has three brothers and three sisters, and some of her older siblings have already left Donegal. The 17-year-old is studying for the Leaving Cert Applied and, after school, plans to spend a year working at the local SuperValu before going on to a higher or further education course: she is looking at childcare in Derry or Letterkenny.English and hair and beauty are her favourite subjects, and she loves rally cars and music.How does she study? “I don’t,” she says frankly.

Photograph: Eamon WardThe 15-year Ennis Junior Cert student who lost his life while trying to save his friend’s life in a double drowning was on Monday described as “a most extraordinary and inspirational young man”.Addressing mourners at a packed St Peter \u0026amp Paul Cathedral in Ennis, Fr Ger Fitzgerald also said that Shay Moloney “had the heart of a warrior”.Last Thursday “courageous” Shay drowned when attempting to save friend Jack Kenneally (15) in a lake at a disused quarry at Knockanean outside Ennis.Scores of teenagers returned to the church for the second funeral in as many days after attending young Kenneally’s funeral on Sunday.Outside the church Shay’s friends wept openly. Students from St Flannan’s College and players from Ennis RFC and Shay and Jack’s U-15 Young Munster rivals formed a guard of honour while Shay’s remains in a white coffin draped with purple ribbon passed by.Both boys were born in January 2003 and were friends since primary school where they attended the Holy Family School in Ennis and this year the two played starring roles in the Ennis U-15 rugby team.In his tribute to Shay, his uncle, Louie, told mourners the family “is completely heartbroken”.He said: “There have been touching tributes in recent days . . . Shay, sleep the long sleep. Always remember that your mammy loves you more than life and your family loves you more than life. Sleep peaceful now Shay, forever young.”In his tribute, Fr Fitzgerald recalled meeting Shay during his Confirmation year. “Shay had not the slightest bit of interest in what I was saying and instead was ripping up a piece of paper to put on a ruler.”Fr Fitzgerald said that Shay fired the piece of paper with the ruler but didn’t hit the intended target and instead “hit me on the head instead. He looked at me . . . almost laughing at me and said, ‘sorry about that Father’.”Fr Fitzgerald said that Shay’s friends were everything to him.Some of the symbols of Shay’s life brought to the altar included a family photograph, rugby ball, his rugby boots, concert tickets and his rugby bag.Louie Moloney told mourners “Shay crammed more into his 15 years than most do in a lifetime . . . he had a happy personality that was contagious and he had a way of dealing with people of all ages and they were always falling for his charms.”Shay Moloney was later laid to rest at Drumcliffe cemetery outside Ennis where the remains of his friend, Jack Kenneally, were laid to rest 24 hours earlier."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519437.1528143971!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tony o brien approved for share options days before leaving hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O’Brien, former director general of the HSE: got approval from shareholders in Evofem at its annual meeting in San Diego on May 8th to acquire 2,057 shares, two days before he stepped down from HSE role. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillTony O’Brien received approval to exercise his first share options as a director of a US healthcare company two days before he resigned as Health Service Executive director general over the CervicalCheck controversy.US stock-market filings show that Mr O’Brien received approval from shareholders in Californian contraceptives developer Evofem at its annual meeting in San Diego on May 8th to acquire 2,057 shares in the company.Mr O’Brien stepped down from his role at the HSE two days later.He resigned as director general after it emerged he had read a memo from the National Screening Service in March 2016 showing letters informing women about false negative smear tests discovered during a clinical audit were being suspended pending legal advice.He had previously said he was unaware the women were not being told about the audit until a media report in April about the settlement of a High Court case taken by Limerick woman Vicky Phelan.Opposition politicians criticised Mr O’Brien’s appointment to the board of Evofem while serving as the HSE chief during the deepening crisis.The Government defended his role at Evofem, saying it was permitted under his HSE contract once there was no conflict of interest and he received consent from Minister for Health Simon Harris, which he had.Mr O’Brien told Mr Harris the job would take up no more than five hours a month and he would work these hours in his own time and travel to board meetings during his annual leave.Political pressure over his role at Evofem last month led to him agreeing to take a temporary leave of absence while he completed the remainder of his term at the HSE. He resigned from the HSE a week later.Public filings for Evofem, a company listed on Wall Street’s Nasdaq stock exchange, submitted a week later included updated information showing his resignation from the HSE.The shares Mr O’Brien is entitled to acquire under the stock options are worth several thousand euro, based on Evofem’s current share price – a fraction of the $65,000 (€55,600) to which he is entitled in directors’ fees every year.The filings show that he must acquire the shares within 60 days of April 30th to avail of his stock options. His boardroom role gives up share-buying options of up to $450,000 in his first three years with the company.A spokesman for the HSE last month defended Mr O’Brien’s description of Evofem as a “not for profit” company in a December 2017 letter to Department of Health secretary general Jim Breslin providing more details of the company he was joining, as requested by Mr Harris in a letter the previous June.Mr O’Brien told Mr Breslin in his letter that, following a reverse merger into an existing public company, Evofem was expected to be listed on Nasdaq in the first quarter of 2018.It became a stock market company in January 2018, the same month Mr O’Brien joined the board."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519366.1528138912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels talks mark beginning of crucial fortnight on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this monthToday begins a critical fortnight in the Brexit negotiations, with Irish officials expecting to receive long-awaited British proposals on the Border in the coming days. Talks are scheduled between the British and EU sides every day this week.The Government wants to see significant progress at the technical talks this week in an effort to break the stalemate between the EU and UK over the future of the Border, and high-ranking sources confirmed that they expected to see proposals from the British this week.Dublin is pressing the British to provide more detailed alternative solutions and proposals on a legally-operable text on the default “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union should no other plan be agreed to maintain an invisible border.The timetable for the EU-UK talks in Brussels lists a session on Wednesday on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sources in Brussels say that it is expected to be a short meeting, dealing with a number of technical issues, although if the UK brings new proposals they will be discussed.Three more days of talks follow this week on the draft Withdrawal Agreement.The Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this month.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit.Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit negotiator, has warned of a difficult summer of negotiations if no progress is made by this summit, pushing negotiations to the October deadline set to allow the UK and EU parliaments time to approve any final withdrawal deal by the UK’s departure next March.“Our position remains that significantly more progress is needed ahead of the June European Council, ” said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.“Michel Barnier has made this very clear, including during his recent visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland. At this stage in the process the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.”Concerns about the lack of progress in negotiations were voiced by Germany’s top Brexit diplomat Peter Ptassek, who played down expectations about agreement being reached by the council on June 28th-29th.Irish officials viewed Mr Ptassek’s remarks as another attempt to increase the pressure on the British to propose solutions in what is viewed as a make-or-break fortnight to prepare for the June summit as UK media reports suggest the British is preparing “Doomsday” contingency plans for no deal.An influential London think tank has said in a new report that British prime minister Theresa May should propose her own version of the backstop for the Border before the summit.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own,” says the Institute for Government report.“It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December.

I want us to discuss, debate, agree with others a programme for government,” Ms McDonald told The  in an interview.She said that she expected to talk to both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about forming a government after the next election, although both parties have repeatedly ruled out any coalition deal with Sinn Féin.In the plainest statement yet of her party’s impatience for power in Dublin, Ms McDonald said she had no preference between the two rivals, and rejected suggestions that she had been “flirting” with Fine Gael in recent weeks. She also rejected suggestions that Sinn Féin was closer “culturally” to Fianna Fáil. She made a strong pitch to the so-called “squeezed middle”, stressing the priorities of public services and the cost of living, as she seeks to broaden Sinn Féin’s appeal from its working class base.She said that a programme for government drawn up by Sinn Féin and one of the big two parties would be a document that “will be ambitious, that will be different and that looks at the red line issues around the health system, people’s standard of living, people’s capacity to have just some disposable income at the end of the week or the end of the month”.Ms McDonald stressed the interests of “people who are at work but are still struggling, people who pay their taxes, do everything by the book and still constantly have their hand in the pocket for everything and who scratch their heads and wonder ‘what am I paying those taxes for?’“People who look at the system and say, it doesn’t work, or it doesn’t work for me, it’s not accountable.”The Sinn Féin leader is seeking to modify her party’s stance in advance of an election to try to keep it prominent in the final stages of a campaign when the attention of many voters turns to the formation of the next government.However, the Sinn Féin leader will have to convince either or both big parties to overcome their stated opposition to doing a deal with her. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has trenchantly ruled out any deal with Sinn Féin, while Fine Gael has also said it will not form an administration with the party. As recently as last weekend, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan categorically ruled out any coalition, citing the party’s economic policies and its association with the IRA, saying “a leopard doesn’t change its spots”.On Brexit, Ms McDonald backed the stated intention of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to demand substantial progress on the Irish border by the time of the June EU summit.“If we are still in a state of drift, the responsible and proportionate thing to do is to hit not the stop button, but the pause button,” she said.“We’ve said this publicly and privately to the Taoiseach. It would be dangerous to leave these things bleed into the summer and the autumn. We need to bring it to a head in June, not the autumn.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneMary Lou McDonald is on a bit of a roll.The Sinn Féin leader was centre stage for the final phase of the abortion referendum. She’s riding high in opinion polls. The New York Times gushed last week that she was “being whispered about as the possible first female prime minister of Ireland”. And today she is serving notice that she is ready and willing to enter government.It’s McDonald’s current mission to overcome that antipathy, or manoeuvre the old rivals into a position where they feel compelled to swallow it.She can fairly point to the recent history of Irish politics, which is a procession of people doing deals they said they never would. But while the post-election numbers may mean a coalition government involving Sinn Féin is an obvious option, the example of the present Government suggests that it won’t be the only one.The process of putting together a government after the next election will be convoluted, but it’s one that McDonald is determined to elbow her way into.McDonald is luxuriating in the approval of repeal supporters since her prominent role in the abortion referendum campaign. She was especially visible in the final weeks, appearing in two television debates and performing capably in both. She describes the campaign as “actual new politics . . . because it was politics beyond politicians”.There is a bit of unfinished business for Sinn Féin, though the Government’s proposed legislation goes well beyond Sinn Féin party policy, which McDonald will now seek to change to a pro-choice position that will accord with the forthcoming abortion Bill.Debate in the party, she says, “is under way at regional level and local level”.“We had some discussion around this. How do you fairly and democratically shape party positions on this issue?”The way Sinn Féin usually does that is that the leadership decides where it wants to get to and then consults extensively with the grassroots, who then approve the position. A special ardfheis in Belfast later this month is likely to endorse the leadership position. But clearly not everyone will agree.Two Sinn Féin TDs, Peadar Tóibín and Carol Nolan, campaigned strongly for a No vote in the referendum. It looks like she will have to throw them out.“I’ve allowed lots of latitude for conscience, McDonald says, “the absolute right for people to hold their view, to articulate their view, to have their view respected . . . Where the line is drawn is where it comes to making the law and forming public policy. And in those circumstances when a Sinn Féin representative walks into an elected chamber, there is a duty on that person whoever they are to vote in accordance with Sinn Féin policy.”But they were elected by the voters, not by Sinn Féin – and they were elected on a party policy that she now proposes to change, and then to punish them when they don’t conform to the new policy.“Everyone who runs for Sinn Féin has to be a Sinn Féin member in good standing. They’re fully au fait with how the party works. All of us know how policy is arrived at . . . That’s how we do our business.”And those who in conscience cannot abide by your new position – you will show them the door?“No, I won’t. The party rules will be applied.”McDonald herself has held a pro-choice position for a long time, she says. So what about when the party’s position was not pro-choice? Did she argue and vote for anti-abortion positions then?Transcripts of Dáil debates on abortion in recent years show McDonald apparently struggling with her responsibility to hold the party line. When Clare Daly proposed a constitutional amendment in 2014, McDonald made a somewhat strangulated speech: “I am advised,” McDonald said, “that Deputy Daly’s well-intentioned proposal goes beyond the democratic mandate afforded me by virtue of my party’s long-standing compromise position, clearly stated and well-known to the electorate. I am, therefore, unable to support this legislation.”She says now: “Let me tell you, I have found myself in positions and at times prior to being leader as an activist where the party’s position didn’t accord with my personal view.”The priority of party discipline and loyalty is something frequently cited by the party’s opponents as evidence of the cultural chasm that separates it from the political mainstream.And while it might make them easy coalition partners, the party has struggled with accommodating dissent. There has been an exodus of prominent members and councillors in recent years, amid allegations of a culture of bullying and intimidation. McDonald pledged to address the issue when she became leader.“Yes, it is an issue,” she says. “I don’t believe there is a culture of bullying. But I do know that we have a changed party, a much bigger party. The way we manage the party has been suited to a smaller party. That doesn’t work now.”She says that the party is “putting the finishing touches to a commission – a commission on ersity, equality and inclusion. It will facilitate conversation across the party about the party. That will be helpful.”Is it an admission of a widespread problem?“It’s an admission that it’s a human organisation . . . It’s wrong but it happens. Rivalry between people can become a thing locally. There were incidents. That’s not unique to Sinn Féin.“You can’t say that it’ll never happen in any organisation,” McDonald says. “The members took it to heart. People took the gravest offence at the suggestion of a culture of bullying.”The question for the outside world, though, is not whether Sinn Féin members have been offended – it’s about the nature of the culture within the party, and what that says about it, and how it would use power if it came to hold it. And the party clearly has questions to answer about it.If there isn’t a culture of bullying, there is certainly a culture of obedience to authority in the party, a prioritisation of the party’s interests, and many of those who fall foul of it have been ostracised. As it prepares – it says – for government, those are questions that are unlikely to go away.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"the lemass","story":"Stonewalling ended when Harold Wilson took power in 1964 and revealed location of bodyRoyal was eager to attend but prospect of official visits exercised former taoiseach"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519215.1528128871!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may must devise version of brexit backstop option says think tank","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prime minister Theresa May: she needs to table something on Brexit border that could work, meets commitments, and is politically acceptable. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesTheresa May should propose her own version of the Brexit backstop option for the Border ahead of this month’s EU summit in Brussels, according to an influential London think-tank.The Institute for Government’s report The Irish Border after Brexit says that while the UK has begun to propose future arrangements on issues like customs that could help avoid a hard border, they are not fully fleshed out and are unacceptable to the EU.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own. It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments, and is politically acceptable,” the report says.British officials have floated the possibility of a backstop that would apply to the whole of the UK, keeping it aligned with the EU on customs and regulations for goods. EU negotiators insist, however, that the proposed backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.“If it sticks to that line, the UK and the EU will need to explore the promised ‘innovative solutions’ either for the North – or the whole island of Ireland – that are both compatible with the joint report and do not upset the delicate unionist-nationalist balance of the Good FridayBelfast Agreement.“The UK could, for example, try reducing coverage to key sectors for cross-Border trade and try negotiating equivalence in specific areas – whereby the EU would accept that the UK was meeting the same outcomes but by different means. It could also propose that the backstop was overseen by whatever governance process is agreed for the Withdrawal Agreement rather than the EU institutions as now. The aim would be to remove the implication that Northern Ireland was separated from the rest of the UK and had become part of the EU’s customs territory and regulatory jurisdiction,” the report says.With EU officials warning that little progress has been made ahead of this month’s summit, government whips told Conservative MPs on Monday that the House of Commons would vote next week on amendments passed in the House of Lords to the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Just a Minute host misses first show in over 50 yearsHeathrow expansion to become official policy -

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours the HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyJust a Minute host misses first show in over 50 yearsHeathrow expansion to become official policy -

This is at least in part because the moon was closer and changed the way Earth spun around its axis.The moon is currently moving away from Earth at a rate of 3.82cm a year, which could mean in around 200 million years’ time, each day will be 25 hours long.Stephen Meyers, a professor of geoscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and co-author of the study, explained: “As the Moon moves away, the Earth is like a spinning figure skater who slows down as they stretch their arms out.” This is because Earth’s movement is at least in part determined by the bodies around it, such as other planets and the Moon, which exert force on it. How our days on Earth are getting longerChanges in this force can effect changes in the orbit Earth traces around the Sun as well as its rotation around and wobble on its axis.These variations, called Milankovich cycles, determine where sunlight is distributed on Earth, and so decide the planet’s climate rhythms. These rhythms can be detected in the rock record, ning hundreds of millions of years.Over billions of years, time has changed significantly on Earth, because the Solar System has many moving parts, including the other planets orbiting the Sun.Changes in the rock record can show changes in Earth’s rotation and allow scientists to map how it moved over time. However, going back billions of years has previously proven difficult as most scientific methods do not give the precision needed for such a leap back in time.Over billions of years, time has changed significantly on Earth, because the Solar System has many moving parts, including the other planets orbiting the SunThis groundbreaking new study used astrochronology, a statistical method that links astronomical theory with geological observation, to discover ancient  climate change and reconstruct the history of the Solar System while looking back on Earth’s geologic past.“One of our ambitions was to use astrochronology to tell time in the most distant past, to develop very ancient geological time scales,” Dr Meyers said.“We want to be able to study rocks that are billions of years old in a way that is comparable to how we study modern geologic processes.”Alberto Malinverno, Lamont research professor at Columbia, joined the project after hearing Dr Meyers speaking about his work at a conference. The two combined a statistical method that Meyers developed in 2015 to deal with uncertainty across time, called TimeOpt, with astronomical theory, geologic data and a sophisticated statistical approach called Bayesian inversion.This combination of methods allowed the pair to reliably assess the direction of the axis of rotation of Earth, and the shape of its orbit, from testing layers of rock in the 1.4 billion-year-old Xiamaling Formation from Northern China and a 55 million-year-old record from Walvis Ridge, in the southern Atlantic Ocean.From this, they could determine the length of day and the distance between Earth and the Moon.Dr Malinverno explained: “In the future, we want to expand the work into different intervals of geologic time.”Just a Minute host misses first show in over 50 yearsHeathrow expansion to become official policy - but government faces battle in ParliamentNew mobile heart attack test could give patients an instant all-clearGlobal 24 hour boycott on plastic packaging to fight ocean pollution begins in wake of \u0026#39Blue Planet effect\u0026#39Comment: The case of the gay wedding cake is why the religious Right keeps faith in Donald TrumpGuatemala\u0026#39s Fuego volcano eruption: 62 dead and hundreds injured as lava surge sweeps through villagesTwenty-seven minutes and Grenfell Tower fire had taken hold: so why weren\u0026#39t residents told to get out?Versailles series three opens with more sex and more intrigue but it is still as cold and uninvolving as ever: episode one, reviewSuffragettes with Lucy Worsley, review: Worsley\u0026#39s love of dressing up was perfect for this timely history docu-dramaUS Supreme Court rules in favour of Colorado baker who refused to make gay wedding cakeNearly two million Britons expected to question their gender, health boss warns NHSLove Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestants as it starts on ITVComment: MPs rail at Grayling while the railways are failingFormer New Zealand sex worker made a dame in Queen\u0026#39s honours listNorman Scott says he may complain to police watchdog over bungled Jeremy Thorpe investigationBrexit bulletin: How lifting the cap on foreign doctors helps \u0026#39Global Britain\u0026#39 France starts work on revolutionary \u0026#39Alzheimer\u0026#39s village\u0026#39 where patients roam almost freeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"airlines profits drop fuel labour costs oil price interest rates iata","story":"Outlook for the industry could be harmed by uncertainty over Brexit and growing trend of protectionist policiesAirlines will make $5bn (£3bn) less profit than previously expected this year, and $4bn less than last year,\u0026nbspaccording to new forecasts by the International Air Transport Association. The IATA expects airlines to report a collective net profit of $33.8bn in 2018, and said this would be a “a solid performance despite rising costs, primarily fuel and labor, but also the upturn in the interest rate cycle”. The US central bank raised interest rates in March, and the Bank of England is widely expected to hike rates in the coming months.In addition, oil prices have been climbing in recent weeks, and in May broke past the $80 per barrel mark for the first time in three and a half years after President Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal. The IATA said it expects the full-year average cost of Brent crude oil to be $70 per barrel, up 27.5 per cent from the average of $59.40 per barrel in 2017, while jet fuel prices are set to rise 25.9 per cent to $84 per barrel. The forecast net profit for this year has been revised down from a previous estimate of $38.4bn, and the IATA’s expected 2018 profit would also come in well below the record $38bn reported by airlines last year.The group also said operating profits, “though still high by past standards, have been trending slowly downwards since early 2016, as a result of accelerating costs”.Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general and CEO, said: “Solid profitability is holding up in 2018, despite rising costs. The industry’s financial foundations are strong with a nine-year run in the black that began in 2010. And the return on invested capital will exceed the cost of capital for a fourth consecutive year. “At long last, normal profits are becoming normal for airlines. This enables airlines to fund growth, expand employment, strengthen balance sheets and reward our investors.”Meanwhile, growing uncertainty about global affairs “could present risks to the industry’s outlook”, according to the IATA. The group said particular risks included the advancement of political forces pushing a protectionist agenda, uncertainty following the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and a lack of clarity on the impact of Brexit.“Aviation spreads prosperity and enriches the human spirit. That truth lays the foundation for a very important message. The world is better off when borders are open to people and to trade. And our hard work as an industry has primed aviation to be an even stronger catalyst for an ever more inclusive globalization,” said Mr de Juniac.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Spending grew 5.1 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, the biggest rise since April 2017, Barclaycard found.In-store spending rose 2.6 per cent as pubs and DIY shops both saw sales jump by almost a fifth over the bank holiday.\u0026nbspGarden centres had the most impressive sales rise, with takings up 50 per cent on this time last year. Supermarkets’ sales were up 10 per cent over the long weekend and 5.7 per cent for May as a whole.The good news will come as welcome respite for high street chains struggling against rising business rates, increases to the minimum wage and consumers who had been tightening their belts.\u0026nbspThe rebound in May saw non-essential spending growth reach a 14-month high of 4.6 per cent, with the warm weather boosting clothing sales by 5.8 per cent, according to the research.The numbers are in stark contrast to the negative impact of the Beast from the East, which dented sales for many retailers as shoppers stayed home to avoid the snow and ice.\u0026nbspNearly a quarter of Brits surveyed said they intend to spend more on experiences this summer. Of those, 35 per cent plan to visit live events such as festivals and a fifth said they are are more likely than usual to go to a pub to watch sport.Despite the strong numbers, UK shoppers have become more pessimistic with 57 per cent saying they are confident in their household finances, down from 62 per cent in April.Esme Harwood, open banking director at Barclays, said a degree of caution among UK shoppers remained but this didn’t stop people enjoying the sunshine.“This brought good news for the high street as Brits updated their wardrobes – with growth on clothes going up by the highest amount in two years – and took to pub gardens to enjoy the blue skies,” she said.“Looking ahead, it seems the experience economy will remain a top priority as consumers plan to treat themselves to major music and sporting events. In the next few months, we expect to see families carefully balancing their budgets to ensure they don’t miss out on their must-see and must-do experiences of the summer.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It’s a shame we can’t be more grown up about it, we aren’t asking for ra-ra skirts or skinny jeans, just grey tailored shorts for two months a year, it’s not a big deal.”Some other\u0026nbspparents also criticised the\u0026nbspnew uniform, which also introduced blazers, as they did not\u0026nbspfeel the clothing was appropriate for warmer months.\u0026nbspWith temperatures set to reach 26C this week, parents were keen for their children\u0026nbspto feel comfortable in the heat.The stricter clothing policy was one of the changes brought in since the school was placed in special measures, after receiving an “inadequate”\u0026nbsprating by Ofsted inspectors in spring last year.But the school appears to be making progress and the latest Ofsted monitoring inspection from November 2017, said: “Pupils value their new uniform, and they are smart and polite and most conduct themselves well.”\u0026nbspHeadteacher Moira Green, who also introduced longer teaching hours since taking on the role, was credited with helping to turn the school around.\u0026nbspShe explained that she decided to remove shorts from the uniform after a consultation, as it was decided more business-like attire was the way to go.Ms Green issued a statement which said: “In September 2017, with the support of parents, Chiltern Edge made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been a success.”She added that the uniform policy was generic which meant that it could be purchased from anywhere, and the only piece of branded attire was a school tie, which was given to existing students for free.\u0026nbspThe issue, she said, was simply that shorts do not feature\u0026nbspas part of the main school uniform.\u0026nbspThe school – which was previously threatened with closure but has since been saved – will be turned into an academy and become part of the Maiden Erlegh Trust in August.Ms Green added: “Maiden Erlegh Trust, in preparation for September 2018, wholeheartedly support Chiltern Edge’s adoption of a more formal uniform.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Even if it\u0027s old.The company\u0026nbspannounced iOS\u0026nbsp12, the new version of its operating software for iPhone and iPads. And while it did not include some of the dramatic features found in previous updates, it did include at least two profound changes.And as well as those, it introduced a raft of fun and meaningful new changes, designed to make the iPhone more fun. They include changes to animoji\u0026nbspand new features to improve the phone\u0027s augmented reality tools.But many of the features were intended to make people spend less time on their phone. The new software includes a variety of ways to do things more quickly, and new ways to remind you to get off your phone.Here\u0027s a full rundown of all the important changes introduced in iOS\u0026nbsp12, which will be released this year.Chief among the new features was something that wasn\u0027t really a feature at all. Instead, it was a promise from Apple to focus on the performance of the new software, ensuring that the phones running it do so quickly and without bugs.In particular, Apple will focus on ensuring that old phones are able to run the software as well as they can. Apple said that iOS\u0026nbsp12 improves the performance of the iPhone 6 – for example – dramatically, even when it is doing intensive processes.This has been a repeated complaint about new versions of iOS – and, anecdotally, one that gets louder every year. This should be the first time that your phone feels much faster after updating, as well as much more exciting.(Apple software boss Craig Federighi claimed that these speed boosts and performance improvements would be a worthy upgrade all by themself.)The other major upgrade was also focused on fixing problems rather than introducing new things. Apple\u0027s Screen Time feature is intended to make your phone a happier and healthier place to be – even if that means stopping you using it.Among other things, the phone will watch how you are using your apps and assemble that into graphs and charts with a whole array of probably shocking information: how often you use certain apps, and how often you pick up your phone. If you see something in there you don\u0027t like, you can set limits – so that your phone will kick you out of Instagram if you use it for more than an hour, for instance.It will concentrate on notifications, too. Apple will make it much easier to ignore them when they\u0027re not relevant to what you are doing, in an effort to stop them being quite so intrusive and distracting you from what you should really be getting on with.Apple is taking a swipe at ubiquitous share buttons created by Facebook and others to track your\u0026nbspbehavior\u0026nbsponline regardless of whether you click on them. The company says it\u0027s shutting down that tracking through its Safari browser in an update to Mac and\u0026nbspiOS\u0026nbspdevices, including\u0026nbspiPhones\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspiPads. Apple senior vice president Craig\u0026nbspFederighi\u0026nbspsaid such tracking would be blocked by default. Even if users click to share an item, they will get a prompt with an option to prevent subsequent tracking.\u0026nbspHe also said Apple would crack down on so-called fingerprinting, in which data companies identify specific devices by creating a unique fingerprint based on a device\u0027s particular configuration settings, installed fonts and plug-ins. Apple plans to instead send out generic data to such collectors, making a user\u0027s device look just like any other Apple device.\u0026nbspFederighi\u0026nbspsaid the changes will make it dramatically more difficult for data companies to identify you and track you.\u0026nbspLast year, Apple added intelligent tracking prevention that imposes time limits on tracking cookies and takes other measures to try to prevent advertising tech companies from following users around the web.\u0026nbspApple rolled out new support for augmented reality applications as it unveiled a new format for digital objects that appear to live in the real world.\u0026nbspThe update comes as Apple tries to extend AR experiences to a broader population, rather than just hard-core, tech-savvy users. The company started that effort last year when it built AR tools into most\u0026nbspiPhones\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspiPads by contrast, Google had limited that to niche Android phone models.Digital objects created with the new format, called\u0026nbspUSDZ, will work in Apple\u0027s Safari browser, Messages and Mail apps, meaning AR isn\u0027t limited to stand-alone apps that people choose to download separately. The format will also get support in Adobe\u0027s Creative Cloud suite of apps for professional photographers, videographers and designers. What remains to be seen is whether there is enough of a compelling reason for someone to use AR, even if it\u0027s built-in to everyday apps.\u0026nbspApple also unveiled an app called Measure that measures boxes and other objects in the real world by pointing the camera at them. Apple is also offering tools to give multiple users a different view of the same digital objects viewed from different angles.In iOS 12, the company\u0027s animated emoji which track a user\u0027s face, known as Animoji, have also been updated to include new animals, as well as the ability to detect when a tongue is being stuck out.A new version of the app, called Memoji, will now also enable users to create animated emoji of their own faces instead of using an animal face.Apple\u0027s video calling tools have barely changed at all since they were introduced in 2010.Now it will include a range of changes, chief among them the ability to speak to more than one person at once. In fact, you\u0027ll be able to speak to 32 people at once.All of that is done within a redesigned interface. When people speak, for instance, FaceTime spots it and ensures that the screen showing the person talking takes up more of the screen.And you can also use the animoji\u0026nbspdescribed above within a FaceTime call. That means you can stick the cartoon version of your face over the real one.Apple wants its digital assistant Siri to do more. Third-party apps will now be able to let users invoke Siri for commonly used tasks, much the way competing assistants from Google and Amazon long have. Before, Apple had limited third-party access to a handful of categories, such as messaging, while excluding competitors to Apple\u0027s Music service, for instance.\u0026nbspThe software update will also let people group similar tasks together into shortcuts that can be accessed by simple phrases like heading home. Saying the phrase can be set to open Apple Maps to find the best route home and launching a radio app.Apple will encourage users to share photos with their friends by suggesting such opportunities in a new for you tab. When a friend receives photos from an event, Apple will then suggest that the friend reciprocate with photos from the same event. It\u0027s similar to how Google already encourages sharing through its own Photos app for both iPhones and Android devices.\u0026nbspApple says all sharing will be done privately, using encryption already built into its Messages app.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

To be fair to barmaid, and soon to be professional celebrity daughter Danni Dyer, she was given a limited range of options to pick from (a reality with which she is about to become over-familiar).“Are you here for love or lust?” she was asked by host Caroline Flack, in what may also have been the first point at which the viewer was indulged with any meaningful sight of either the front or top halves of Love Island\u0027s five, female enthusiastically bikini\u0027d contestants, whose characters by this point had not been permitted to develop much beyond the ambulant backside stage.Though this will doubtless prove no obstacle to national sweetheartdom, Danni told barefaced lies with almost her very first words. For Danni, we learned, is here for love.So Danni is not here, definitely not, for paid for instagram endorsements and a five figure deal with Dancing on Ice.\u0026nbspIt was a further ten minutes after that before Love Island was back on our screens in awful, wretched earnest. That moment came when Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor walked in and everyone\u0027s favourite flesh-packed lab rat experiment in psycho-sexual cruelty came roaring back with that now familiar sense of fear and joy and shame and loathing.Let’s be clear. It’s Alex’s fault. Alex is an A\u0026ampE doctor. Alex has a proper job, a middle class accent and an un-chiselled abdomen that screams ‘all this is beneath me’, which for the avoidance of doubt, it isn’t.“Step forward if you fancy Alex,” was the instruction given by presenter Caroline Flack to the five women, so quite why all five of them evidently heard the words as “Start digging and don’t stop til you see the Sydney Opera House” is a mystery presumably to be\u0026nbspsolved in later episodes.As Alex was moved to the “subs bench”, to watch the traditional parade of male models and semi-anthropomorphised eight packs go wild at the very pick and mix from which he had just forcibly ejected, one can only imagine the past horrors whirring behind his eyes that he would rather be living right now. Freak accidents with industrial machinery, high speed dashes through plate glass doors, that kind of thing.\u0026nbspBy tragic process of elimination, it was “musical theatre performer” Samira who was compelled to “couple up” with the not-so good doctor. And if you’re looking for a reason why musical theatre performer\u0026nbspSamira’s acting career has thus far not propelled her further than heavily implied contractual obligation to have night vision enhanced sex on ITV2, then it showed.It’s not like Alex won’t have seen that kind of mask of undisguised horror before, though traditionally he\u0026nbsphas a horrifically misshapen X-ray to hand.Still, Samira’s already done her bit in the name of public service, and that was this line of questioning, in which the lack of punctuation is definitely the model’s own. “So you work in A\u0026ampE then, that’s pretty intense how long have you been single?” As always with Love Island, the profundity is left unsaid and it was very clearly this: Absolutely no one is interested in your job mate. Keep it to yourself.It was also Samira who, barely a few hours after screaming “Welcome to the summer of our lives” would be trying not to wince as the man she was all but forced to be sharing a bed with would be doing his best to sneak in some sort of corrective gumshield as the lights went out.Elsewhere, some models decided they fancied some other models, whose names we will remember later and forget shortly after that. A shoe shop manager boasted about the size of her in-store discount, but a man called Jack who claims to sell pens for a living was not brave enough to admit his career in stationary had been chosen solely for access to cheap Tippex for use on\u0026nbsphis own teeth.Still, Cupid’s arrows have been fired. Eleven of them, simultaneously, at high speed, into a tiny circle\u0026nbspfrom point blank range, and one thing’s abundantly clear: absolutely no one’s wearing much in the way of body armour.Now\u0026nbspwe step back and watch the low rent Tarantino style bloodbath unfold.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

These variations are called\u0026nbspMilankovitch cycles and can even affect Earth\u0027s environment as they impact how sunlight is distributed on the planet.One of the ways Prof Meyer was able to make these calculations concerning Earth\u0027s rotation more than a billion years ago was by looking at the sediments in a 90 million-year-old rock and the information it gave him about the planet\u0027s climate cycles.The moon is believed to be moving away from Earth at a rate of 3.82 centimetres a year, so it will be hundreds of millions of years before it has moved far away enough for humans to have to recalculate how long a day is.Using the geological artefacts along with the data about the speed at which the moon is moving away from Earth has allowed Prof Meyers to make more accurate predictions on Earth\u0027s history than every before.The geologic record is an astronomical observatory for the early solar system, he added.We are looking at its pulsing rhythm, preserved in the rock and the history of life.The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Spending grew 5.1 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, the biggest rise since April 2017, Barclaycard found.In-store spending rose 2.6 per cent as pubs and DIY shops both saw sales jump by almost a fifth over the bank holiday.\u0026nbspGarden centres had the most impressive sales rise, with takings up 50 per cent on this time last year. Supermarkets’ sales were up 10 per cent over the long weekend and 5.7 per cent for May as a whole.The good news will come as welcome respite for high street chains struggling against rising business rates, increases to the minimum wage and consumers who had been tightening their belts.\u0026nbspThe rebound in May saw non-essential spending growth reach a 14-month high of 4.6 per cent, with the warm weather boosting clothing sales by 5.8 per cent, according to the research.The numbers are in stark contrast to the negative impact of the Beast from the East, which dented sales for many retailers as shoppers stayed home to avoid the snow and ice.\u0026nbspNearly a quarter of Brits surveyed said they intend to spend more on experiences this summer. Of those, 35 per cent plan to visit live events such as festivals and a fifth said they are are more likely than usual to go to a pub to watch sport.Despite the strong numbers, UK shoppers have become more pessimistic with 57 per cent saying they are confident in their household finances, down from 62 per cent in April.Esme Harwood, open banking director at Barclays, said a degree of caution among UK shoppers remained but this didn’t stop people enjoying the sunshine.“This brought good news for the high street as Brits updated their wardrobes – with growth on clothes going up by the highest amount in two years – and took to pub gardens to enjoy the blue skies,” she said.“Looking ahead, it seems the experience economy will remain a top priority as consumers plan to treat themselves to major music and sporting events. In the next few months, we expect to see families carefully balancing their budgets to ensure they don’t miss out on their must-see and must-do experiences of the summer.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He is the only politician from the right of the political spectrum to have led the country since the end of the First World War.If the right-wingers successfully form a government they would shift the balance of power on the European Council further to the populist right just as Italy, previously governed by a centre-left prime minister, gains a far-right coalition government.“I am not obliged to award the mandate to the relative winner of the election, but I will do so because I strongly believe in democracy,” president Borut Pahor told local media.It may prove difficult for Mr Janša’s party to form a majority in the highly fragmented field of parties, however. Preliminary results show the group came top by winning just 25 per cent of the vote and 25 out of 90 seats in the country’s parliament – with ideologically similar coalition partners thin on the ground in the historically progressive country.The far-right Slovenian nationalist party, a potential partner, has just four seats, while the Christian Democrats have seven – with practically all the other parties adhering to different flavours of liberalism or socialism. A pensioners interests party which won five seats participates in the outgoing government.A broad coalition of liberals and social democrats could hold a majority but would need at least five parties to participate in order to reach a majority.Right-wing nationalist parties have come to power in Hungary, Poland, Italy and Austria in recent years, representing a new bloc of largely anti-immigrant politics at a European level.Last week the far-right League party and their allies the anti-establishment Five Star Movement came to power in Italy on a promise to deport irregular migrantsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called A Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/as-graphic-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"liam fox brexit power britain","story":"Why? Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze. But it is time to stop knee-jerk grievance merchants portraying this tragedy as a callous act of politically-motivated spite.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They havent understood a thing.There is only one way to save these lives: fewer people leaving, more repatriations.Life is sacred and to preserve it we must ensure that people dont go to sea in dangerous tubs.There is not enough housing and work for Italians, let alone half the continent of Africa.The League leader also visited the port of Pozzallo where a boat with more than 150 African migrants landed last week after being rescued.On Saturday he declared the “good times for illegals are over” and warned them to “get ready to pack your bags”.This has been the destination for most of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent years after setting off on smugglers boats from lawless Libya. Mr Salvini said: We have to improve deals with countries of origin.Earlier on the same day, he joined Premier Giuseppe Conte and the rest of the newly sworn-in Cabinet to view the Republic Day parade.

I agree with him entirely, Putin said in a short extract released ahead of the full interview.Apart from mentioning the US withdrawal in 2002 from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Putin did not elaborate.Trump made a similarly vague reference to the issue in April, when he said Stop the arms race? in a tweet that also mentioned providing help for the Russian economy.The Kremlin later confirmed it had no received no communication from Washington aimed at setting up a summit between Trump and Putin since the two spoke by phone in March.The Wall Street Journal had cited sources saying the White House is in the early stages of planning for a potential summit between the two.However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: We feel a deficit of initiative (from the US side).Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The manoeuvre caused the infant’s legs, arms and torso to become detached, leaving the head still in his mother’s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant’s head.It was ”re-attached” to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is believed the child was already dead before he was decapitated during the 15-minute delivery.Mr Tim Bradbury, chairing the tribunal, said: “The tribunal found that the breech extraction and consequent use of traction was necessitated by Dr Laxman’s earlier decision to proceed with a vaginal delivery and which is the subject of the tribunal’s finding.“Laxman’s conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation.“But for Laxman’s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.”He added that Laxman had not sufficiently addressed in her mind the risk to Baby B by proceeding with a vaginal delivery - namely the risk of head entrapment and the delay this complication would inevitably cause.The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The womans waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mothers cervix was between 2-4cm dilated.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm.She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later while discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: We are not doing a c-section - you would never do a c-section of a 25 weeker.She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her too push.Last month consultant Laxman, who denied misconduct, said the youngster would have died had a C-section been carried out during the procedure on March 16 2014.She told the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester: “I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard.“I did not intend to harm mum or the baby.I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”Laxman qualified as a doctor in Chennai, India, in 1999.The mother – known only as Patient A – came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: “I don’t forgive you – I don’t forgive you” as the doctor stared down at the floor.The patient then looked away as Laxman’s QC apologised on her behalf.The mother added: “I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated.“I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn’t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible.“Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.”The tribunal panel will now decide whether or not Laxman remains fit to continue practicing as a doctor."},{"url":null,"title":"russian tv news photoshops smile onto kim jong un as he meets top moscow official to make him appear happier","story":"The dictator met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Pyongyang on Thursday, just weeks before a planned meeting between the US and the North Korean regime.Although Kim did crack a smile during other parts of the meeting, the photos and footage of the moment he posed for the cameras during a handshake with Lavrov show him stony-faced.But a segment about the meeting during the programme News of the Week on pro-Putin TV station Russia 1 featured a still of Kim smiling alongside Lavrov.A photo of the same moment published on the official Twitter of the Russian Foreign Ministry also shows Kim looking grim-faced.Bloomberg Moscow deputy bureau chief Scott Rose tweeted: “Russian state TV, rising to the occasion, photoshopped a smile onto North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at his meeting with Lavrov.”The host of the show is Dmitry Kiselyov, who has been called a Putin propagandist and claims the US is in league with terror group ISIS.Lavrov became the first top-ranking Russian to meet with the current head of North Korea.The pair met ahead of the much talked about meeting between Trump and Kim scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.The Foreign Minister reportedly invited Kim Jong-un to Russia.In return Kim thanked him for the invitation and asked him to convey his greetings to Vladimir Putin and the Russian people.Russia 1 has been contacted for a comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict0004107702471.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"m1 underpass blocked travellers rubbish","story":"Shocking photographs show how litter has completely blocked the underpass at junction 12 near Flitwick, Beds.And at 2pm, motorists driving vans were seen towing caravans from the site and police said no arrests had been made.It is unclear whether the group will be investigated after the mess was left by the roadside.Bedfordshire Council is now expected to be left with a huge bill as they begin the mammoth task of cleaning the area.It comes after taxpayers spent a staggering £57million in 2017 to clean fly-tipping sites around the country.Highways England today said they had staff down at the site and are looking at how long it will take to clear.A spokesman told The Sun Online: “Highways England served notice last week on a group of travellers at junction 12 of the M1 for them to move on, giving them until today.“They are now in the process of moving away from this site.“Highways England has now been able to get staff on site and have requested for our contractors to attend urgently to assess the situation, provide an estimate for when it can be cleared by and the cost of this.“We already collect vast amounts of litter from motorways and major trunk roads every year, but we’d much rather be spending our time carrying out other essential maintenance work.“Fly-tipping causes a hazard to drivers, our workers, the community and wildlife, and we will look to recover costs of this where possible.”Councils are hoping to crack down on fly-tipping and have said that those that do could be prosecuted.Penalties for fly-tipping were increased after the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.It is now a criminal offence and those who are found guilty face a fine of up to £50,000 or 12 months imprisonment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000407541881.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle joins queen royal engagements without harry","story":"The new Duchess of Sussex will accompany the Queen at a theatre opening and a lunch in Chester next week.The pair will have a jam-packed schedule as the 36-year-old new royal and her grandmother-in-law will also open the Mersey Gateway Bridge.This will be Meghans first official event without Prince Harry by her side.The newly married couple havent been seen in public since Prince Charles 70th birthday bash -

The BBC presenter angrily confronted the Prime Minister following the disaster last June - a clash that left Mrs May floundering and branded inhuman on social media. Speaking to Radio Times Magazine, the Newsnight host admitted: Friends told me it was the angriest they had ever seen me. The reason I went so hard that day was because - I think - I had heard and seen the anger first hand, she said. This was no longer an intellectual exercise. But Maitlis, who volunteered by sorting donations before broadcasting from the scene, said she still felt sympathy for Mrs May. The Prime Minister faced a huge public backlash last year for failing to immediately meet victims of the disaster that killed 72 people. In a second visit an angry crowd surrounded her car and screamed “coward” and “May must go”.  During the painful interview, Maitlis told the PM: You misread the public mood on this one. You misread the anger that people feel about this. They shouted coward after you this afternoon. In robotic fashion, May answered: What I have done since this incident took place is, first of all yesterday, ensure that public services had the support that they needed in order to be able to do the job they were doing in the immediate aftermath. Maitlis interjected: But that\u0027s three days on, Prime Minister, this is Friday evening. They needed those things in place on Wednesday. No one was in charge.   Looking back a year after the fire, Maitlis said: Let me say here, for the record, that actually I had enormous sympathy for Theresa May that day. She looked spent and exhausted a week after a failed election, a summer of terrorism and tragedy on this inconceivable scale. Maitlis said that the tragedy horrified and disturbed me for many nights to come. She added: Survivors were turning up, shell-shocked and looking for someone to tell them what to do, where to go. There were very few people in authority there. That day was powered by volunteers - amazing people who got their act together when no-one else seemed to have a clue what to do.

The Labour leader will launch a stinging attack on the Prime Minister when he addresses the GMB union annual conference in Brighton. The Tory leader last night told the US President she was “deeply disappointed” at his “unjustified” decision to slap 25% duties on imports from countries including Britain. Experts warn the move could jeopardise thousands of jobs in the fragile British industry, WHICH exported \u0026pound360million worth of steel to America last year. In a 30-minute phone call, Mrs May vowed to tackle Mr Trump on the taxes when the pair meet at this week’s G7 summit in Canada. A No10 spokesman said: “The Prime Minister said the US, UK and EU are close national security allies and we recognise the importance of the values of open and fair trade across the world.  “The Prime Minister also underlined the need to safeguard jobs that would potentially be affected by the decision.” Mr Corbyn will today taunt Mrs May over a series of transatlantic spats with the White House. He is due to say: “The Tory Government’s timid response shamefully fails to stand up to Trump ... The Tories are too weak to stand up to the powerful, and too in hock to them even if they wanted to. “Theresa May is appeasing Donald Trump in the hope of getting a race-to-the-bottom trade deal with the US after we leave the European Union. “The Trump trade tariffs show that’s a Tory pipe-dream.”  A senior Labour MP urged the Government to clobber Mr Trump with tariffs over his Scottish golf courses. John Mann hit out after International trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK would work with the EU on its response to the President’s tariffs. Urging the Government to “fight him”, Mr Mann told the Commons: “I can’t believe what I’m hearing. “It’s a good job steelworkers and steel communities didn’t wave the white flag when they’d been called upon repeatedly to defend our shared values with the US over the last 100 years. “The only language that Trump understands is people fighting back - it’s about time this country fought back. “We can do it - golf.

The 59-year-old says she had consulted with neighbours before installing the \u0026pound2,500 home improvement. Under council law, any decking more than 30 centimetres above the ground requires planning approval. Ms Duffy\u0027s was around 70 centimetres high. The ex-council worker was staggered when she found out a neighbour had complained about the decking and that she was being taken to court for breaching local planning rules.  Retrospective planning permission and subsequent appeals were both refused on the grounds of the impact on neighbouring residents in Westhoughton, Greater Manchester. Ms Duffy was fined and ordered to reinstate the decking to its maximum permitted height. Despite complying with the ruling, the retired former Bolton Council employee says she has been left disappointed and bewildered by the prosecution. Ms Duffy pleaded guilty to the offence at Bolton Magistrates Court last week and was handed a conditional discharge.  She was also ordered to pay \u0026pound125 towards the council\u0027s investigation, a \u0026pound200 contribution towards costs and a \u0026pound20 victim\u0027s surcharge. Ms Duffy said the decking was first installed in June 2016 without objection after consulting with neighbours. A court heard she had consulted with her neighbours on either side who were happy the decking would enhance the area at the back of her home. But it came as a shock when another neighbour complained about the decking.  Prosecutor Marcus Hirst told the court Ms Duffy had failed to respond to a letter sent in February this year requesting further information about how the enforcement notice had been complied with. She was prosecuted by Bolton Council for failing to comply with regulations. Ms Duffy told a court she had not deliberately broken the rules, as she believed the platform was at ground level - and had delayed lowering while seeking further advice. She has since had the platform lowered from 70 centimetres to the 30 centimetres permitted together with a step up - at a cost of more than \u0026pound300.  Speaking after the hearing, Ms Duffy said: Unfortunately I had it done too high, I didn\u0027t realise I had to have planning permission for decking. I realise I didn\u0027t comply, but my factors were I didn\u0027t know what was considered ground level, I thought my house was at ground level, I didn\u0027t realise planning would be needed. The aim was to make the garden more accessible as I have friends with mobility problems, I didn\u0027t wilfully break the law. I spent \u0026pound900 on planning consultants to give me advice and I put in another planning application, but unfortunately that didn\u0027t come to fruition.  Ms Duffy said she felt she had valid reasons for not complying with the enforcement notice sooner: I was surprised, I think it\u0027s nonsense, but I have to say I was found guilty of not complying with an enforcement notice. I\u0027m surprised it went to these lengths as it\u0027s decking we\u0027re talking about. The reason I didn\u0027t think I should have put an application in is that, to me, it\u0027s at ground level.

Little Nathan suffered serious burns as the molten plastic fused to his skin, while he was simply playing football with a friend. Police and firefighters were called to Hulton Lane Playing Fields in Bolton following the incident on Saturday evening.  Nathan\u0027s mum Shivonne Flynn told the Manchester Evening News that a group of teenagers had been setting fires nearby, but hadn’t paid much attention to the two boys.  When the youngsters’ football rolled in their direction, Nathan went to pick it up.  It’s understood one of the teenagers – said to be aged about 14 to 15 – began talking to him before starting to stamp out a fire with his foot. “He was talking to him quite nicely to start with,” mum-of-three Shivonne said. “He started to stamp out the fire with his foot, then he picked up a plastic bottle that was on fire and launched it at Nathan. “It hit his arm and the molten plastic stuck to him. He tried to use his hand to get it off and burnt his hand as well.” The young boys then ran to a house on nearby Edge Hill Road and were looked after by a couple who called his mother. Police and fire crews also attended, and a trauma technician from Bolton Central fire station treated Nathan and dressed his arm before Shivonne took him to Bolton Royal Hospital. The 30-year-old mum added: “He’s been back to hospital this morning (Monday) and had the dressing taken off his hand. It’s blistered, but it’s his arm they’re more worried about.  “They‘re concerned about scarring and infection. “Things could have been so much worse. The plastic melted to his t-shirt. Nathan could have gone up in flames and these kids need to know and understand that it is serious, and could have resulted in so much more than burns. “There was no reason for what they did. They weren’t being horrible to him, but then all of a sudden there was a split second switch from good to evil.”  Shivonne shared a photo of her son bandaged up on Facebook urging parents to remind their children about the dangers of playing with fire.  She also wanted to thank the couple that helped him, who are understood to be named Sharon and Paul.

Bristol Live report that it wasn\u0027t just the rowdy behaviour of a minority which led to the flight\u0027s cancellation.  While police and easyJet staff were delayed dealing with the disruption, the weather forecast developed. EasyJet released an initial statement about the incident which the company then updated late on Saturday evening. In the update a spokeswoman explained that it was the bad weather which ultimately led to the flight being cancelled - and around 140 people having to get off the plane before it had moved at Bristol Airport. However, it\u0027s thought that if there hadn\u0027t been bad behaviour, the flight might have been able to take off safely before the weather became an issue. An EasyJet spokesman said: EasyJet was required to cancel flight EZY6267 from Bristol to Prague on June 1 due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board which caused a delay - the flight was further delayed and then cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. She went on to apologise for the effects on passengers and said it had done what it could to help those affected. The spokeswoman added: “EasyJet’s crew did everything possible to minimise the disruption for our remaining passengers who have been given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or receiving a refund.  EasyJet also provided hotel accommodation and meals for those passengers who required them. “Our crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time. “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board and always push for prosecution. “The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet\u0027s highest priority.” A police officer, Nick Falconer, took to Twitter to share pictures of the police operation.

Meghan first accompanies the Queen to open the Mersey Gateway Bridge in Widnes, Cheshire. She will then return to her acting roots to formally open the Storyhouse cultural centre in Chester. And finally they will attend a lunch in Chester Town Hall.  Meghan, 36, has previously accompanied the Queen on engagements – such as the Commonwealth Day service in March – but then there were also other royals in attendance. Sources suggest the plan is to capitalise on Meghan’s huge popularity, and getting her “front of house” with the Queen on June 14 will surely delight the crowds in Cheshire. She thrilled guests at her first event as a royal – Prince Charles’ 70th birthday bash at Buckingham Palace garden party – just days after her wedding.

The 32-year-old told Bristol Live she hears \u0027squishing noises in her head like she is drowning\u0027 and her own heartbeat is a constant banging.  The Bristol woman is now totally dependant on carers to carry her out of her wheelchair and bed and she eats liquid meals through a tube.

Venitia\u0027s life was very different five years ago. Despite being born with the condition, it was only after risky brain surgery that her life was turned upside down. Before the procedure she was able to walk and take her little 11-year-old girl, Akeelah, swimming. But in 2013, when doctors discovered the structural defects in the base of the skull and cerebellum, - the part of the brain that controls balance - and she was told without an operation she could have less than two months to live. Since the surgery, she says her life is now unbearable and she fears she cannot continue living with such intense pain every day. Her only hope is to travel to America - a world leader when it comes to treating Chiari Malformation - and undergo more opertions. However, for this she needs to raise a staggering \u0026pound72,000.

Despite this when the Daily Mirror received a dramatic telephone call at 10.15am on May 1, 1968 no-one could have predicted the tale which would emerge. A man said he wanted to talk about a friend and a serious crime. He was to solve a mystery which had baffled police who had been called to a countryside cottage where firefighters had found a body. The mystery caller said he would arrive at the office in about fifteen minutes. At 10.30am, the man arrived at the main door in London\u0027s Holborn and was shown to a third floor waiting room.  He was scruffily dressed and looked tired. In quiet, jerky sentences, he told about a crime that he said he knew had been committed. He said he had a friend who knew all about a murder and he was waiting at London Bridge railway station. At first, he would not give his name, but as details tumbled out he could not keep up his pretence. There is no friend, it is me, he confessed. He was 28-year-old Hungarian chef Imre Gathy, and he described how on the Saturday before he had left his wife and two young children, at home in Harrington Road, Brighton. He said he had rowed with his wife after losing his job and had set out to look for work.  As he walked out of the seaside town along the A23 towards Gatwick a car pulled up. Inside was a man who it later transpired was retired naval Lieutenant Commander Humphrey Gilbert Grace. Grace had had a religious conversion almost a decade before when his mother had died suddenly. While he was away at the funeral his younger son was blinded in one eye in an accident. Since then, he had developed a fondness for picking up down and outs and taking them back his family home while his wife was away.  On this weekend Mr Grace\u0027s wife and teenage daughter were on holiday in Greece and two sons at boarding school when he offered Gathy a lift. The 29-year-old got into the green 1965 Morris Mini-traveller and the pair drove off towards Gatwick. As they got near Gatwick, Gathy said he asked to be dropped off as he knew the manager of the airline canteen. But Grace said that he could call him from his nearby home, and so they drove to October House. Once inside Gathy said he had a wash and called his friend at Gatwick Airport at 4pm, but it was his day off. He had tea with Grace, and, according to Gathy, the retired naval officer started to talk about God and read from the Bible until about 11pm.  Grace then showed his guest to a bedroom, which was a back room with a single bed where he slept until the morning. The next morning, Gathy said that he wanted to contact his wife, but claims that Grace said that he should let her wait adding that the man should wear the trousers. Reports at the time said that Gathy claimed later that Grace came out directly talking about the subject of homosexuality, saying that the Bible spoke of \u0027Love thy neighbour\u0027 - he took it to mean that you could love another man like your wife. He claimed Grace\u0027s response was to put his hand on the top of his leg. Gathy said he struck Grace with the back of his fist and that the older man jumped up and started shouting and screaming. He said that he then came towards him and he fell out of the back of his chair. Gathy said he grabbed a doorstop and hit the commander over the head - killing him. He said he panicked, and thinking he would make the crime look like a robbery, stole some silverware and fled back to Brighton. He twice tried to set fire to the house where he had killed Mr Grace, but the fire did not take and smoke was spotted by neighbours who alerted fire fighters who found the body. Gathy said he decided to hand himself in, but instead of going to the police station called the Daily Mirror to confess.

A court previously heard the child was hit and kicked in the face, which is believed to have made his old injuries bleed, ABC reports.  Dillon, 40, who had carried out the beating after Bradyn allegedly stole lollies from him, left his son to lie unconscious for hours. Instead of calling the emergency services, the father went on the Internet and searched what to do if someone is knocked out. Finally, an ambulance was called to the home in Jacka, Canberra. Bradyn was taken to hospital, where he tragically later died. He had suffered more than 60 injuries to his head and body following months of violence by his father, according to court papers.  The court heard his death was caused by his aggregated brain injuries. Last year, Dillon pleaded guilty to murdering Bradyn.  And now, he has been sentenced to 36 years for the murder, with a further five years added for grievous bodily harm and assault charges including choking and threatening to kill, according to 9 News .  He was sentenced at the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, where details of his shocking crimes were read out.  Justice John Burns said the defendant\u0027s conduct towards his son could aptly be described as torture, The Canberra Times reports.

In a landmark ruling, the justices, in a 7-2 decision, faulted the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\u0027s handling of the claims brought against Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, saying it had showed a hostility to religion. The commission said Phillips violated the Colorado anti-discrimination law which bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012.  But the court did not issue a definitive ruling on the circumstances under which people can seek exemptions from anti-discrimination laws based on their religious views. After being rebuffed by Mr Phillips, Mullins and Craig filed discrimination charges with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, who ruled in their favour. The case went to the Colorado Court of Appeals, who also ruled in favour of the couple, but Mr Phillips pushed the Supreme Court to take his case, which they agreed to do last summer. The Supreme Court heard arguments last December and large crowds of protesters gathered outside in support of the couple. Two of the court’s four liberals, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, joined the five conservative justices in the ruling authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Thomas Owen Hughes, 20, was found lying dead below the Eden Roc apartment block yesterday morning at around 11am. It is thought he leapt over a wall, thinking the hotel corridor continued on the other side. He was initially described by police on the island as Irish - but this morning they said he was British. Investigators also said they believed he fell to his death after mistaking the apartment block where he fell for his holiday hotel.  Mr Hughes is understood to have been staying at Magaluf’s Universal Hotel Florida, close to the Eden Roc block. Sources at the local Civil Guard, the force investigating Mr Hughes in conjunction with a local court, said today they believed the death was a tragic accident. One said: “Investigators suspect he may have mistaken the building he fell from with his hotel which is just a couple of doors away and jumped over a wall at the end of a corridor thinking the corridor continued the other side.  “The only thing the other side of the wall was a drop of around 65 feet. “Investigations are continuing but there is nothing at this stage to suggest his death was the result of a crime and suicide appears to have been ruled out.” The results of the autopsy - which was due to be carried out today in the island capital Palma - have not been revealed. Police have not said what time they think he died and whether he had been drinking in the run-up to the tragedy. He had only arrived in Majorca with friends the day before he was found dead.  Friends took to Facebook to express their shock at what had happened.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/DNic_McManus_Open-2.JPG.jpg ","title":"dundee

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent. The local government needs-based funding formula takes into account a number of factors such as rural and island communities, as well as road length and number of school pupils.\"A spokesman for the UK Treasury said: \"We\u0026rsquove helped make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved bodies in the world and they have a full range of tax powers to raise funds.\"Tuesday 5 Jun 2018 1:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I enjoyed Peru as well, it was brilliant and something that I’ll definitely learn from.”The Scots found it tough against the World Cup-bound Mexicans whose side contained the likes of ex-Barcelona and Tottenham player Giovani dos Santos, former Arsenal man Carlos Vela and Barcelona legend Rafael Marquez.The performance of Shinnie at left-back and Don Scott McKenna skippering the team in just his fourth cap were two positives.Shinnie added: “We were trying to keep our shape as best we could.“We knew that they would move and pass the ball about well so when we turned the ball over we were trying to keep it ourselves and get ourselves forward.“It was tough to do it, but when we did do it, especially second half, we had a good go.“We’re disappointed, Oli McBurnie has one off the post and we were desperate for it to go in.“But I think second half we definitely came into it more and got forward a lot more and created a lot more problems.”Conditions were gruelling with the stadium in Mexico City being 7,200 feet above sea level. Shinnie said: “It was tough, at one point in the first half I felt like I was swallowing sand.“It was good, it’s different experiences and it’s something that I’ll potentially never experience again.”Scotland boss Alex McLeish has been pleased with the trip to South America overall, despite the losses to both Peru and Mexico.The Gothenburg Great said: “The trip has been great, the players have been very professional.“Normally they would be on their holidays. We would love to be going to the World Cup the same as Mexico.“But we have played a couple of games that can help us build for the future.“It was a very tough game for us at altitude and in these conditions.“I think the players that we had out there did the country proud.“We are trying to get better on the technical side and we have asked the players to look at their game and be brave, to make passes and receive passes.“It’s a big part of the plan going forward.”One frustration for McLeish was Scotland’s lack of threat in attack.He added: “We looked to be more of a threat, to get players forward in the box. I felt that we never had the best of deliveries. When we got into wide areas, we hit the first man a lot when we had good presence in the box.“You saw when we got a good cross in the second half, McBurnie had a good header, he was unlucky he hit the post. In the first-half, we had crosses potentially for the strength of Callum Paterson but we didn’t quite succeed.“Both teams made changes, that can upset the rhythm of the game, but both teams did what they could to impress the fans and the coaches.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shinnie and mckenna earn pass marks for scotland as manager mcleish takes first strides on road to lifting hopes of a nation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen’s Scott McKenna captaining Scotland was one of the few highlights from their 1-0 loss to Mexico.The Dark Blues finished their South American tour with defeat in the famous Azteca Stadium with the only real positives being McKenna as skipper and another solid display from Dons captain Graeme Shinnie who played the whole game.The superiority of the World Cup-bound Mexicans was clear with the Scots only creating one clear-cut opportunity in what was a largely forgettable 90 minutes for the Tartan Army as they watched a team lacking in creativity.The merits of Scotland’s trip to South America at the end of a long season have to be questioned – but the tour has been a successful one for the Dons in Alex McLeish’s squad.Pittodrie skipper Shinnie has finally been given his opportunity and he has shown what many of us have known for a while: that he is capable of playing at international level.While McKenna’s fairy tale continues.The 21-year-old had already had a dream season breaking into the Aberdeen team and winning his first two caps for the national side in March.But on this trip McKenna has doubled his tally to four and has now captained Scotland.Gothenburg Great McLeish seems keen to build his defence going forward into the Uefa Nations League and the European Championship qualifiers around McKenna.He clearly has total confidence in the youngster and for McKenna to skipper the Dark Blues in just his fourth cap is an incredible achievement and he was one of Scotland’s best performers in what was a disappointing display.He is following in the footsteps of Aberdeen legends like Martin Buchan, Willie Miller, McLeish and Jim Leighton in captaining his country.Seven changes were made to the side which lost 2-0 to Peru in Lima last Wednesday morning.Jordan Archer, Charlie Mulgrew, Lewis Stevenson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, Jamie Murphy and Matt Philips dropped out.McLeish drafted in keeper Jon McLaughlin, Jack Hendry, Shinnie, Johnny Russell, Callum Paterson, former Dons loanee Ryan Christie and Oliver McBurnie to start.The changes were necessary due to the heat in the famous Azteca Stadium as well as the altitude, with the ground being 7,200 feet above sea level.But after only 13 minutes the Scots found themselves trailing.Edson Alvarez crossed from the right, Giovani dos Santos slipped the ball on to Carlos Vela just inside the area, he turned and Hendry’s slip allowed the former Arsenal man to square for Dos Santos who fired a low shot past McLaughlin from 18 yards with his left foot.The Scots were struggling to get the ball and string more than two passes together as the first period wore on.Former Aberdeen man Kenny McLean was the only player in Scotland’s midfield who seemed to have the confidence to try to keep possession and build attacks.Mexico could have doubled their lead just before the half hour when Miguel Layun’s 25-yard curler came back off the right post.McLaughlin made a decent save from Hirving Lozano’s long-range effort as the one-way traffic towards Scotland’s goal continued.At the start of the second period sub keeper Scott Bain made saves from Lozano and Hector Herrera in the opening 70 seconds.Then on 49 minutes McBurnie hit the right post with a powerful header from 10 yards after Russell crossed from the right.After not creating a chance in the first half this was more promising from the Scots.But on 53 minutes they were fortunate not to concede when Mexico broke at speed from a Scotland corner.At the end of the move Vela was free and could have shot but opted to cut back for Layun, but Shinnie and Bain smothered his effort.Scotland were given another let-off with 25 minutes left when Lozano blasted off the crossbar from 10 yards after getting away from sub Charlie Mulgrew.Sub Oribe Peralta had the ball in the Scots net with 18 minutes left but he was flagged offside.Despite Scotland’s best efforts in the closing stages they were unable to salvage a draw.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party.

He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"wren kitchens open new store","story":"NewsWren Kitchens to open new store at Ayr retail parkThe firm will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:38, 30 MAY 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new tenant is to take up residence in Ayr’s out-of-town shopping park. Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

representing so many young soldiers of the war - with thousands.\nThe show will also incorporate stories about local men at each performance, which are being sourced as part of a community engagement project led by Legion Scotland.\nWorking with the likes of schools, youth groups and history societies, the veterans charity is helping research the local area\u0026rsquos contribution to the war in order that these stories might be preserved and passed down to future generations.\nProfessor Norman Drummond, chair of the Scottish Commemorations Panel appointed to oversee the WW100 commemorations on behalf of the Scottish Government, added: \"By the end of the war, thousands of men from Scotland had gone valiantly to the frontline, a high proportion of whom never returned.\n\"For many survivors, devastating injuries and the trauma of war changed their lives forever, while the nation as a whole grieved the vast loss of loved ones.\n\"It is vital that we continue to commemorate these losses today, and the Far, Far From Ypres tour, a key part of Scotland\u0026rsquos Armistice centenary programme, will carry this message to people of all ages across the country as we encourage families to attend with all generations in tow for what will be a highly moving and educational experience.\"\nThe tour is being delivered by WW100 Scotland in partnership with Legion Scotland and Poppyscotland.\nCabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop, added: \"World War I had a devastating impact on our nation, with no town or village unaffected.\n\"The Far, Far From Ypres tour, part of the broader programme of activity to commemorate Scotland\u0026rsquos Armistice centenary, will ensure that we continue to learn more about and reflect on what we have learned from the First World War.\n\u0026ldquoUntil the end of 2018, through a series of events taking place across Scotland, Scots can continue to reflect on the devastating impact of WWI and its lasting social and civic legacy, ensuring that the brave soldiers who fought in one of the world\u0026rsquos most brutal conflicts will never be forgotten.\"\nTickets\n, which cost cost \u0026pound15 (\u0026pound10 concession), for the Selkirk show on August 5 are available from the Scott\u0026rsquos Selkirk Shop, 18 Market Place.\nThey, along with tickets for other performances, can also be purchased online at http://bit.ly/2KCsV9g.\nLisa Denham, creative communities manager for charity Live Borders believes the Far, Far From Ypres tour is unmissable.\nShe told us: \u0026ldquoAt Live Borders we are big advocates of touring theatre productions, offering our own Borders Live Touring programme, and this looks fantastic.\n\"The mix of historical impact, strong messaging, community engagement and a stellar cast make it a performance not to be missed.\n\"I recommend those looking to book for the Victoria Halls get their tickets soon!\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Galashiels fashion graduate s cerebral palsy catwalk creations","story":"A FASHION graduate in Galashiels has created an innovative clothing range to help people with cerebral palsy.\nLaura Reid took her inspiration from a book written four decades ago, which revealed that clothing for people with disabilities was either designed for the very young or elderly.\nThe Heriot-Watt graduate\u0027s collection took up the challenge of filling the gap.\nAnd she was influenced from the fashion-forward 1970s to keep on-trend with the mainstream market.\nLaura said: \u0026ldquoCurrently, the options for young adults are limited, with many brands not focusing on the younger adult market and not being financially viable due to the niche market.\n\u0026ldquoI wanted to design a collection which was suitable for my age group -

High Street and through the Market Place by Selkirk Silver Band, who for the the first time included its talented junior section.\nRiders had come from afar as St Andrew\u0027s, Morpeth and Musselburgh as well as almost every Borders town to take part.\nAnd they were rewarded with a night few of them will forget.\nMr Hislop added: \"For many of the riders this will be their first taste of a Common Riding rideout.\n\"They are the next generation of riders who will one day ride the Marches and help continue our ancient traditions.\n\"The Junior Rideout is very much part of our Common Riding now and we hope it will continue for many years to come.\"\nThe Selkirk Ex Standard Bearers\u0027 Association would like to thank Scottish Borders Council for help is organising the event,

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"picnicing in glengyles spring sunshine","story":"Last Friday, on the 10th festival\u0026#8217s final day, at Glengyle, the emphasis was on fun for all the family and the Whisky Warrior Challenges, for adult whisky connoisseurs, who thought they had seen it all.These athletic tasks, set by the Wee Toon Warrior\u0026#8217s fitness fanatic, Fiona Irwin, included: The Grubby Grubber \u0026#8211 have you got what it takes to be a master maltster?
