No mean feat considering the competition from Netflix, catch-up TV and hundreds of channels. Her stay at the Street has not been without heavy discussion, with some questioning whether her approach to darker storytelling suits the show but there can be no denying that more people are watching than ever and she leaves the show in a much stronger state than she found it.As she heads on to pastures new and takes over prime time drama Bancroft, we sat down for a good chat with Kate about her time in the show, her final storylines coming up and also allowed her the chance to set the record straight on her departure and have her final thoughts on the ‘is Corrie too dark?’ debate.I was most nervous about what we talk about when we tackle a story like this – imitative behaviour which is someone doing it because they have seen it. I took some private, personal advice on that from a couple of friends who work in mental health.I also just had to think about my own experiences with my training with Samaritans. I also strongly believe that not talking about it isn’t working so I went through a whole process and had to think “how would I feel if…?” But I think it’s more important to raise the subject and try something else.Yeah, I’m all right about that side of things – I have gone from being very thin skinned to much thicker skinned! I have been asked by a researcher before appearing on Lorraine whether there were any low points to my time on the show and I thought “actually, no – without wishing to sound too twee about it, it all helps and it all counts and I will use it all in my career at some point”. I am very well supported – so many nice people have my back.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision(Picture: ITV)It kind of almost collided by accident to be honest – all of those issues with male mental health. Sometimes as a producer you would think “hang on, we’ve got a lot of stories that cover that vibe at the moment” – but that was a really good thing. We decided to cluster them and talk about it from all different angles because it is important and the figures are staggering and they are tragic.Things do need to change. I find it interesting that they are all different men with very different issues and approaches to life. Their support networks are all very different and in some cases those support networks work brilliantly and in others, people don’t know there is a problem.This is true to life. They all felt like natural character trajectories – the characters all held up to these journeys and as a theme for the show, it worked quite well.Not particularly – I still think it should be story led. With Donna in Emmerdale for example, when I spoke to Verity, she was brought back to play this final story – it was Ross’ and Marlon’s story really. Whenever you kill a character, it has to be more about the story that is left behind. For example, a character like Katie – Sammy is a brilliant actor who had been in the show for ages and also a really good friend – what that story gave was year’s worth of story for Robert and Aaron. Sammy had made the decision to go and it’s about what powers us forward – you always have to be thinking when you have six episodes to fill, what is going to drive that narrative.I was aware of the number but if I look at each of them inidually, I can justify every single one – I don’t think any of them were wasted deaths and all of the actors rose to the challenge. I have always worked with people who were gracious and generous – they always come in and do the job, even if it is challenging. There hasn’t been the same level of mortality in Weatherfield – but the key thing is about what it gives you afterwards. We’re not trigger happy, I promise – we always consider each death carefully.Yes. I suppose a way you could look at it is I could have completely avoided it if I wanted to – plenty of producers don’t want to get involved or talk to the press and that’s completely fine that’s their wand. In a social media society we live in, people always have an opinion on everything – sometimes the things I have responded to, I have got a dry sense of humour – sometimes when people are mean about me on Twitter, I have my own methods on how I might deal with that (laughs). But that’s just because that’s just how I respond to certain opinions.What I have been grateful for from the press is being able to have the chance to explain something or put something in context. In theory, drama shouldn’t have to explain itself because people watch it and it should exist on its own merit. But sometimes it’s nice to give context and explain where we are coming from and what we hope to achieve.It has been a bit of a surprise but I am very well supported and it has taught me a lot about resilience. I feel a little bit tougher that I did two years ago and that’s okay – I also understand that it’s part of the game I’m never necessarily playing a game but I do have a job to do and have to tell stories important to me and I know that others have to create their own careers off of that too.I think there will be a lot less interest in me and that’s no bad thing. I think it’s important to remember that out of the millions of Coronation Street viewers, the overwhelming majority haven’t got a clue who I am. There is a small percentage of people who do – most people don’t care and just care about the drama in front of them.With any drama, some people will immerse themselves and want to know all the IMDB credentials and some people couldn’t care less.When Iain MacLeod is here, he will have the same kind of thing I imagine and I am sure he will handle it brilliantly and I am looking forward to just concentrating on the script and the story. But as I say, sometimes it’s a luxury to be able to speak publicly and clarify things so it’s a double edged sword and I am very comfortable with that.Yes, you have to leave stuff in the story cupboard – I did that in Emmerdale with my team. The Ashley story was started under me but don’t forget, that was pitched by Maxine Alderton, that wasn’t my idea.Robron was also something I was able to leave and that’s something which grows which is fantastic. What I like about Iain and his work and why I’ll be interested in his work at Corrie – he did things with those stories that I wouldn’t have done.The Ashley point of view episode, I could watch that as a creative piece and think “hats off, I would never have thought of that”.I think that’s why he has succeeded with those stories and why I can watch him as a creative in his own right and think – “okay, that’s exciting!” I am sure he will do the same at Corrie. For my professional sensibilities, I want to leave good stuff and be proud when I go – don’t forget, my stuff will have my name on it ’til the autumn it’s my reputation and I care very deeply about that.But I care very deeply about the show as well and I have said before, you only look after these programmes for a period of time and then you hand them on.That is very much the job – if you just want to burn through stuff just to put your name on it, you won’t make many friends.MORE: Coronation Street’s male suicide story for Aidan Connor is a brave and necessary move that will save lives(Picture: ITV)I suppose all I would say is that I am sad that they were conflated because from my point of view and my bosses’ points of view, that genuinely wasn’t the case.Anyone who thinks that I pay too much attention to controversy hasn’t been paying much attention to the way I work and what I do. It’s pretty clear that I don’t cave easily and I love my job and I have been so privileged to do it. I genuinely don’t mind the stuff that comes out around it – it’s all part of the beast that is Coronation Street.I am really excited about the next job and I know that I will look back on this period of my life and be choked by how lucky I have been to do it. I come out feeling robust and hungry for the next thing.I love that soap can do that so I absolutely would work on soap again because I love the pace and I love how people talk about it. I feel very comfortable in it, I understand it, I like the people who work in it, I like the people who write about it – I just like it. So of course.One of the things I am most proud of is when you look at our reach of 16-34 year olds a couple of weeks ago around the big Phelan stuff, it was higher than it had been since 2006. That is pre Netflix, pre tablets and all of that kind of stuff – we have all of that competition now and yet it was still higher than in 2006. That makes me think, brilliant! The future of soap is just about people rising to the challenge – you’ve got to roll with the punches.When the network says, we want six a week – I left Emmerdale when it was doing seven a week – the figures were fantastic. So you go “all right, let’s do this. We need to have an extra meeting this week, we have to make sure these stories are at the top of their game. We have to justify it.” There is a side of it which means that people in my job – I don’t want to say burn out as that sounds negative – but reach the end of the process for themselves.Maybe that happens a little sooner but I think the shows are guarding against that – when you look at what Emmerdale is doing at the moment, there’s a couple of producers running it. Jane Hudson is incredible and I have worked with both Kate and Laura and they are amazingly talented, creative women.(Picture: ITV)That’s all about ensuring there is energy and creative ideas coming through all the time. The production side will have to evolve slightly, the writers will just have to keep bringing it and I think the viewers also have to allow the changes to happen organically but equally, we need to listen to their critique. It doesn’t just Teflon off me when people say it’s not funny or warm anymore or we miss this or that – we do really think about it and we try very hard.Those critiques have helped me through my whole process here and have been very valuable to me but I do think soap has a good future because I am leaving the show with the ratings in good form and higher than when I got here and when I get frustrated about negative press, that’s what I want to say – the ratings are higher, it’s sort of end of discussion, they’re the facts!If I was leaving the show with declining ratings, I might have given a different answer but I’m not – and I have enjoyed every moment. And there’s been such a great team around me, it’s not just me.Oh I thought you meant when I “snapped” at Holly! My boyfriend was sitting at home saying “that’s not Kate snapping!” (laughs). Well, Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby are coming in for a bit of fun and part of Helen Flanagan’s exit story.We’re kind of replaying a bit of a trick we have used before because Rosie has already been on shows but it will be great comedy.Phil and Holly will play themselves – I had a couple of hopes where I thought I could get them to slightly play against type! They’re such good sports – I am very happy. That’s the benefit of being in a big production company like ITV – I know Emma Gormley who runs daytime – she’s an amazing, successful person and a good friend of mine so I was able to give her a ring and she said: “yeah, that sounds fun!”I would love that! I think he would kick ass.(Picture: ITV)We have some amazing stuff with Jim McDonald. He’s going to be coming back with a lot of resentment because of what Steve did – from his point of view, he has been rotting in prison and no one cares. We also played a story 18 months ago where it seemed like Steve might have inherited a genetic disease from his dad but no one went to see Jim to ask if he was okay. We have a great story to play with that.Things get massive for the Metcalfes – they will be big right up until Christmas. I can’t promise they will still be the Christmas story as Iain is taking over from me but they have huge material for them that will see Tim and Sally at their best.We have Lewis – king of cads! He is returning – I would have him for as long as Nigel Havers would want to stay as he works brilliantly with Sue Nicholls and I love that existing dynamic that he played both mother and daughter. It’s perfect and I love everything that they have done with Sophie Thompson as none of them have overplayed it.I was anxious about that story as it’s about a medium talking about Richard Hillman. If you are going to tell that truthfully, you have a woman whose husband was a serial killer, then you have a stranger coming in but you’re playing it for laughs – how can you expect Helen Worth to play that honestly? But the writers were brilliant and were able to unfold it so it feels very truthful in the moment and we will just spin it in a bit of a different way after that. Sophie does everything with integrity – she was perfect for it.We also have Steve and Tracy – you’ve got to love it. I see them as a bit of a fiery Jack and Vera. They fit into old school Corrie but they are not old school actors – they are fresh with it. Kate Ford benefits from a much more rounded type of storytelling. She is fantastic.  When you look back at the layers she has played alongside Deirdre, Blanche, Amy, Steve and so many other relationships, there is such depth to this character. We can still see the darker side of Tracy, she’s still a superbitch – but a much more believable one.(Picture: ITV)I always liked their reunion. I didn’t always have Steve and Tracy in my head – it came about later in the day – but I always had it in my head that Steve and Michelle couldn’t see out his indiscretion. His thing with Leanne was a story I inherited – it gave me lots of mileage. What we played was Michelle losing that child and then the truth coming out – and what happens after that? Kym and Simon work brilliantly together but I just don’t believe she would forgive him after that – the dynamic needed to break up because of that and we had to go with something else. I can’t pretend that Steve and Tracy was my game plan from the start but it has grown and I think it works.Again, I probably refer back to my earlier comment about not being afraid of controversy – it’s more important to reflect the truth. If you tie things up with a bow, there’s a danger people take away from that: “it’s all right then, we don’t need to talk about this anymore, it’s done.” But it’s not done. There are lots of things within that story that we couldn’t show on screen. If I were going to show that story in court, I’d have been fascinated to have played the truth of it – I hope he doesn’t mind me name dropping here but I am really good friends with (Judge) Robert Rinder and I talked to him about the story and he spoke to me about how he might cross-examine someone on the stand or how someone else might.Rob is a massive supporter of the storyline – he’s a great friend and sounding board. Duncan Craig from Survivors Manchester did the same when he took us through the kinds of questions someone might be faced with on the stand. It’s hard and it’s brutal and you question whether we are set up in the best place to get these convictions? If it were a 9pm drama and we saw David Platt on the stand talking about what had happened to him, a barrister might cross examine him with a huge level of detail to try and discredit him – it is really intimate and makes you think “I never thought about it that way and how it could be spun”.I think it’s important not to artificially tie things up – I believe that David’s perpetrator wouldn’t be convicted in this instance. David got rid of all of the evidence. We will have to tie the storyline off – it will find an ending which will surprise people. David will get a catharsis and some acknowledgement but he might not get that legally. In soap, a lot of the justice often comes from the community – Phil Collinson used to call it the court of Coronation Street and I completely get that.(Picture: ITV)I can say that Phelan was biblical on those sea walls – he imposes his own biblical imagery and there is definitely that in his exit. We have collided stories like we did last May with Who Pushed Ken, Bethany’s story and Nick’s exit. We’re doing that again – they’re the richest stories for me. It’s difficult in these set weeks when there’s one event and everything else feels like you are just waiting for the moment – Connor gives it his all as always it’s such a good week, I’m proud of it.That’s a great question to end on but also the hardest. In a way, it all passes in a blur – it’s so busy. Without wanting to sound twee, it’s such an incredible experience – there aren’t many people as privileged to have done what I have been doing. If you had asked me ten years ago if I’d be doing this job, I’d have laughed and hidden and not thought it were possible – I’m so lucky. I feel incredibly lucky and I look back on it with nothing but fondness – even the challenging bits.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/954573250.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"david haye just ten pounds heavier tony bellew rematch","story":"Tony Bellew and David Haye weigh in ahead of Saturday (Picture: Getty)A lean David Haye weighed in just ten pounds heavier than Tony Bellew for their rematch.Haye was almost a stone heavier than Bellew for their previous encounter 14 months ago, but tipped the scales at 15st 10lbs 2oz (220lbs) ahead of their second encounter.Bellew too was aiming to be lighter for the showdown and he weighed in at 15st 4oz (210lbs).Bellew and Haye enjoyed an amicable final face-off compared to the melee at yesterday’s press conference.There were no punches thrown this time, but there were plenty of words exchanged as Haye hurled insults at a smiling Bellew."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10343842.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"mums mirror selfie goes hilariously wrong thanks photobombing toddler","story":"(Picture: Georgia Shorthall)If you say you’ve never had a selfie go wrong, you’re lying.Unflattering angles.

But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/10/4BD80ABD00000578-0-image-m-8_1525425832384.jpg","title":"Theresa braces devastating losses counting begins local elections","story":"Local election voter ID check - LIVE: People denied right to vote in UK for first time ever due to lack of identification | The IndependentElectoral Commission | How to vote"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/18/4BBD1CDD00000578-0-image-a-9_1525195159708.jpg","title":"Teachers year long sabbaticals away classroom 5m scheme","story":"    Damian Hinds will earmark £5million to pay for experienced teachers to take a year off school to work in industry or on academic researchTeachers will get sabbaticals as part of a raft of new measures aimed at making the profession more attractive, the Education Secretary will announce today.Damian Hinds will earmark £5million to pay for experienced teachers to take a year off school to work in industry or on academic research. The fund will pay their wages.As part of his offering, he will also announce proposals to drop an accountability measure that names and shames ‘coasting’ schools. It has been hated by teachers since it was introduced three years ago as the Government had originally said those identified would be forced to become academies.The new sabbaticals for teachers will act as a reward for those with ten or more years of experience and will enable them to work on projects that complement their work in the classroom. Participants will be expected to show how their work will benefit their pupils when they return to school.It follows warnings about a teacher shortage caused by rising pupil numbers and an improving private sector job market. Announcing the move today in a speech to the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr Hinds will say he is keen to attract more talented people to the profession.‘All of us have a shared goal of making sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession,’ he will say.Essex teacher who kicked a female pupil and branded her...The pupils who can\u0027t talk properly: Education secretary vows...British schools linked to an Abu Hamza \u0027terror academy\u0027 are...Ex-integration tsar warns a £50million plan to end ided...Share this article‘We will take an unflinching look at the things that discourage people from going into teaching or make them consider leaving … and we will also look at how we support teachers to get better at what they do and hone their experience and career progression.’While there are currently a record number of teachers working in schools, the increase in staff has not kept pace with the explosion of the pupil population following a period of sustained migration.The measures proposed by Mr Hinds are aimed at encouraging more people into the profession to plug the shortfall. Other offerings include introducing ‘flexible working practices’ and extending on-the-job training for new teachers.And in an olive branch to the profession, the Education Secretary will also say he intends to drop the ‘coasting schools’ accountability measure.Currently, school exam results are judged on two measures – a minimum ‘below the floor’ standard and a ‘coasting’ standard aimed at exposing those schools that are not performing as well as expected even if they meet minimum requirements.          The move intends to stop burn out and help teachers advance in their careersTeachers branded the measure complicated and unfair. Mr Hinds will now revert to one minimum standard, with a consultation on how that should be set, and no threat of the measure being used to force schools to become academies.Only schools deemed failing by Ofsted will now be in line for conversion into academies.Stressing the need for accountability, Mr Hinds will say today: ‘I intend to replace the current confusing system of having both “below the floor” and “coasting” standards for performance.‘I have a clear message to schools and their leaders: I trust you to get on with the job.’Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, welcomed the proposals. ‘Teaching is such a rewarding profession, so it’s disheartening to see teachers leaving due to the pressure of workload and high stakes accountability. A fund for sabbaticals is exactly what we’re asking for.‘Removing the coasting and floor standards will do much to address the confusion felt by many school leaders.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/14/4BD3CBEE00000578-5689353-The_clip_captured_on_a_dashcam_shows_a_car_zooming_past_a_cyclis-a-1_1525440207092.jpg","title":"Chris Evans pays tribute mother Minnie returns air","story":"\u0027Mum was incredible, she needed to be at peace\u0027: Listeners...Share this article    Chris Evans, pictured with his mother Minnie at London\u0027s Chelsea Flower Show in 2000\u0027My mum was only supposed to last a month or two, but five months after this, seven months in all, she was still there.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. . It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

I call upon the international community to condemn the grave anti-Semitism of Abu Mazen (Abbas), which should have long since passed from this world.\u0027 He added: \u0027Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, gave another anti-Semitic speech. With utmost ignorance and brazen gall, he claimed that European Jews were persecuted and murdered not because they were Jews but because they gave loans with interest.\u0027 David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel, said Abbas had reached a \u0027new low\u0027 while President Donald Trump\u0027s envoy Jason Greenblatt said \u0027peace cannot be built on this kind of foundation.\u0027Tensions between Israel and Iran show us that once again the...Share this articleThe comments came after Abbas, who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism before, suggested in an address to a rare meeting of the Palestinian National Council on Monday night that Jews\u0027 relations with banking had led to hostility against them.\u0027From the 11th century until the Holocaust that took place in Germany, those Jews - who moved to Western and Eastern Europe - were subjected to a massacre every 10 to 15 years. But why did this happen? They say \u0027it is because we are Jews\u0027,\u0027 he told the hundreds of delegates.He then cited \u0027three books\u0027 written by Jews as evidence that \u0027hostility against Jews is not because of their religion, but rather their social function,\u0027 adding he meant \u0027their social function related to banks and interest.\u0027He contrasted this with Jews in Arabic countries, who he argued had not faced similar persecution.Friedman said on Twitter late on Tuesday Abbas had \u0027reached a new low in attributing the cause of massacres of Jewish people over the years to their \u0027social behaviour relating to interest and banks.\u0027\u0027  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused the Palestinian president of anti-Semitism after Mahmud Abbas suggested Jews were to blame for the Holocaust\u0027To all those who think Israel is the reason that we don\u0027t have peace, think again,\u0027 he added.Greenblatt said the comments were \u0027very unfortunate, very distressing \u0026amp terribly disheartening,\u0027 calling for them to be \u0027unconditionally condemned by all.\u0027Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon told AFP Abbas\u0027s \u0027anti-Semitism\u0027 was \u0027all the more shocking considering that he presents himself as wanting to make peace with Israel.\u0027 The European Union condemned Abbas for \u0027unacceptable remarks\u0027. \u0027The speech Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered on 30 April contained unacceptable remarks concerning the origins of the Holocaust and Israel\u0027s legitimacy,\u0027 a spokesman for the EU\u0027s diplomatic service said in a statement.\u0027Such rhetoric will only play into the hands of those who do not want a two-state solution, which President Abbas has repeatedly advocated.\u0027 The row comes as relations between the US and the Palestinian leadership have broken down over the controversial American plan to move its Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The move, which is due to be completed on May 14, sparked major protests by Palestinians, who consider east Jerusalem their capital, and led Abbas to cut off ties with Trump\u0027s administration. "},{"url":null,"title":"How change Twitter password","story":"Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

It has taken four generations of hard-working ancestors saving until there was enough money spare for my late father to put a deposit on a house.\u0027Mrs Gabriel, who also attended court, said that her son had been \u0027crucified\u0027 by the strain of the court battle.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/13/4BB4F23700000578-5691219-image-a-71_1525436953731.jpg","title":"Who Candace Owens Kanyes favorite free thinker","story":"    After being praised on Twitter, Candace Owens and her boss Charlie Kirk secured a meeting with Kanye West and the trio met in CaliforniaReturning to the social media platform after a breakdown in 2016, Kanye tweeted: ‘I love the way Candace Owens thinks,’ and followed up this tweet with one reading ‘Only free thinkers.’Frank Ocean parodied this tweet by posting: ‘I love the way Michelle Wolf thinks.’ But who is Candace Owens?Who is Candace Owens?Born in Stamford, Connecticut, Candace is an American writer and conservative commentator.While she was in high school, she received a number of racist phone calls that were later traced to a car in which the son of Governor Dannel Malloy was present.Candace’s family sued the Stamford Board of Education and won a $37,500 settlement.

She was cleared of all charges.Louis Spencer Louis, 24, is the fourth child and eldest son of Earl Spencer and will therefore inherit his father\u0027s estates and title ahead of his elder sisters. He studied at Diocesan College in Cape Town and later enrolled at the University of Edinburgh.

The images were captured by eight New York Times photographers who worked for the parks department while on strike from the newspaper. Photographer Paul Hosefros captured the above image of a boy sucking his thumb while sitting on a platform at an abandoned ing area at Red Hook Pool in 1978          New York City Parks Director and Curator of Art and Antiquities Jonathan Kuhn told DailyMail.com that the images were never published and it\u0027s unclear what their purpose was going to be. Photographer Neal Boenzi captured the above image of a man roasting a pig inside what\u0027s believed to be Brooklyn\u0027s Prospect Park          Kuhn has selected 65 images for an exhibit titled, \u00271978: The NYC ParksNew York Times Photo Project\u0027, at Central Park\u0027s Arsenal Gallery from May 3 to June 14, 2018. Photographer Gary Settle captured the above image of young kids playing on a jungle gym inside what\u0027s believed to be Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens          Kuhn spoke with five of the six living photographers and most of them vaguely remember the project because they\u0027ve taken thousands of photos during their lengthy careers. Photographer Neal Boenzi snapped the above image showing young women walking on the splintered boardwalk at South Beach on Staten Island          \u0027When I probed them about their methods of photography, they\u0027re looking for that unexpected moment of surprise, of unguardedness, and so that\u0027s also what interested me about these pictures,\u0027 Kuhn told DailyMail.com. Photographer Paul Hosefros captured this image showing a group of boys flexing their muscles at Coney Island in BrooklynKuhn has selected 65 images for an exhibit titled, ‘1978: The NYC ParksNew York Times Photo Project’, which will be held at Central Park’s Arsenal Gallery from May 3 to June 14, 2018.Of the historic discovery, Kuhn told DailyMail.com that it ‘was clear the artistic value was high’ with the images which were captured by Neal Boenzi, D. Gorton, Eddie Hausner, Paul Hosefros, Bob Klein, Larry Morris, Gary Settle and Joyce Dopkeen, who was the first woman hired as photographer for The New York Times. \u0027These were really top notch photojournalists who were combining a sort of documentary sort of feel but were also sort of combining artistic sensibility. The photos are all color which is good because, I suppose the predominant motive of photographing at that time would have been black and white,\u0027 Kuhn said.It\u0027s unclear how long they worked for the Parks Department or how much they were paid. Kuhn spoke with five of the six living photographers and most of them vaguely remember the project because they\u0027ve taken thousands of photos during their lengthy careers.\u0027When I probed them about their methods of photography, they\u0027re looking for that unexpected moment of surprise, of unguardedness, and so that\u0027s also what interested me about these pictures,\u0027 he said.\u0027Sometimes they\u0027re using telephoto, sometimes their subjects clearly knew they were being filmed, in which case they used their seasoned photo journalists who could gain the rapport of their subjects.\u0027But more often than not, they are capturing them without their knowledge so there\u0027s a sense of real use.\u0027           \u0027I\u0027ve always been intrigued by how parks represent our society at large. You know, I guess the subways are another venue where everyone is brought together in a different way, but in these pictures clearly represent to some extent a revolving demographic of New York. But they represent all ethnicities, all classes, all nationalities – quite a wide variety of activity,\u0027 Kuhn added. The above image shows the Fiesta Folklorica at the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park, Manhattan. This is one image in the collection where it\u0027s unclear which photographer captured this historic moment          Joyce Dopkeen, the first woman hired as a photographer for The New York Times, captured the above image of park revelers at park in the Bronx. For years she worked as the only female photographer for the newspaper          The slides mainly focus on what are called today as the \u0027flagship parks\u0027 which includes Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortland Park in the Bronx, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Coney Island Park in Brooklyn, Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and Central Park. Photographer Gary Settle captured the above image showing a woman happily holding her shoes while walking in the water at the Unisphere inside Flushing Meadows Corona Park in QueensThe New York City Parks and Recreation Department employs their own staff photographers who go out each day and capture images inside the city\u0027s parks. But those images are \u0027more official and show construction or playgrounds or openings and so forth,\u0027 Kuhn noted.\u0027So these images from the Times photographers are very different,\u0027 he added. \u0027I\u0027ve always been intrigued by how parks represent our society at large. You know, I guess the subways are another venue where everyone is brought together in a different way, but in these pictures clearly represent to some extent a revolving demographic of New York. But they represent all ethnicities, all classes, all nationalities – quite a wide variety of activity.\u0027Some are obvious and common, like people swimming at the beach, some are less common like cricket or a guy roasting a whole pig – which by the way is not a legal thing to do in the park.\u0027The slides mainly focus on what are called today as the \u0027flagship parks\u0027 which includes Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay Park, Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Coney Island Park in Brooklyn, Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and Central Park.          Kuhn noted: \u00271978 was an interesting year, it was an exciting place. Studio 54 was happening, the Yankees won the World Series and the US Open moved to Flushing Meadow Park for the first time in 1978.\u0027 Photographer D. Gorton captured the above image of a boy petting a cat during the Cats on Parade inside the Central Park Mall in Manhattan          Photographer Paul Hosefros snapped this image of two boys playing handball at Seven Gables Playground in Queens          Photographer Paul Hosefros captured the above image of a young woman resting after swimming at Red Hook Pool in Brooklyn          Photographer Ed Hausner captured the above image showing a family trying to salvage a picnic table inside of an unidentified park One of the many captivating images in the exhibit shows a little boy barefoot and sitting on an abandoned ing board at an empty pool in Red Hook.\u0027The pool is filled with liter, wood and debris and this boy climbed up onto the ing platform barefoot, which I don\u0027t think we would let someone do this today,\u0027 Kuhn stated.\u0027Clearly this picture tells you a lot. It\u0027s saying that this place was no longer fulfilling its function, it\u0027s telling you that there was no body minding the pool at the time and that they let a young kid in. And yet he\u0027s sort of there sucking his thumb in this poignant picture.\u0027 Other images show women in their swimsuits walking along a boardwalk, children playing on a playground, teen boys running while playing handball and more. \u00271978 was an interesting year, it was an exciting place. Studio 54 was happening, the Yankees won the World Series and the US Open moved to Flushing Meadow Park for the first time in 1978,\u0027 Kuhn noted.\u0027So the narrative I saw with the images though starkly was that here\u0027s this year considered one of the worst in the city\u0027s fiscal history, in terms of it\u0027s ability to manage itself, and yet people are still joyful in many of the pictures and engaging actively with their parks. \u0027Sort of creating a sense of that they are essential no matter what.\u0027 1978: The NYC ParksNew York Times Photo Project will be on show at Central Park’s Arsenal Gallery from May 3 to June 14, 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"Six story deep sinkhole length two football fields opens New Zealand cow farm","story":"A sinkhole the length of two football fields and the depth of a six-story building has opened up on a New Zealand farm  A worker stumbled upon the chasm before dawn when he was rounding up cows for milking on the farm near the North Island town of RotoruaHe says the area often develops sinkholes due to degrading limestone rock beneath the ground\u0027s surface.GNS Science volcanologist Brad Scott told Newshub the sinkhole was three times larger than any he\u0027d seen before. He says an underground cavity would have developed over decades.Tremain says he\u0027s planning to install a fence so livestock don\u0027t fall into the sinkhole.

Antonio Carluccio, who died in 2017, was known as the Godfather of Italian Gastronomy and passed away aged 80It states that binge drinking dangers included ‘accidents resulting in injury’ - sometime causing death - and ‘losing self control’.The guidelines state: \u0027To keep health risks from drinking alcohol to a low level you are safest not regularly drinking more than 14 units per week.\u002714 units is equivalent to a bottle and a half of wine or five pints of export-type lager over the course of a week - this applies to both men and women.\u0027If you have one or two heavy drinking sessions, you increase your risks of death from long-term illnesses and from accidents and injuries.\u0027Giving guidelines on binge drinking, the NHS states: \u0027The potential risks of single drinking sessions...can include accidents resulting in injury (causing death in some cases), misjudging risky situations, and losing self-control.\u0027You can reduce these risks by limiting the total amount of alcohol you drink on any occasion (and) drinking more slowly, drinking with food, and alternating alcoholic drinks with water.\u0027According to the charity Alcohol Concern there have already been 2,962 alcohol-related deaths this year - and there were 7,327 alcohol-related deaths in the UK in 2016, the latest figures available.The Drinkaware Trust - an independent alcohol education charity - states that if you drink more than six glasses of wine a week you are at a higher risk of alcohol affecting your health."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/17/0F9648E700000514-5692025-image-a-111_1525450122839.jpg","title":"Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis net worth revealed","story":"    Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has been hailed a hero after criticising Labour MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims on BBC ’s Question TimeMartin has also attracted media attention after suing Facebook for publishing adverts using his image to promote scams and the virtual currency Bitcoin.This news came after the social media platform was grilled for sharing personal details of nearly 90 million people with Cambridge Analytica. But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

Mr Kang is believed to have fled with a large amount of foreign currency and a \u0027machine capable of printing American dollars\u0027.The high-ranking espionage officer was thought to be part of the

back in the 1930s.Because of his inside knowledge of North Korean espionage dealings, it has been claimed that at least 10 of Pyongyang\u0027s agents have been given orders from Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, to assassinate him before he can be granted safety in Europe. The DailyNK reported: \u0027Despite presently being unable to locate Mr Kang, the search is still under way. \u0027It is

They also believe a white shroud will make it harder to spot on the skyline, sparking claims the tragedy could be forgotten.Instead they want it to be green, which is the colour that has been adopted by Grenfell survivors and campaign groups during vigils and marches, and on social media. Pulling down the sheeting and replacing it with a green one would cost up to £400,000, sources say.Officials had previously promised that the charred tower would be covered by early this year after psychologists warned that the sight of it was worsening the trauma of those living nearby.Scaffolding was put up in August – two months after the fire ripped through the building, killing 71. The first plastic sheets were put up in October and officials planned to cover up one floor every week.But the construction has been painfully slow and has stalled since the row erupted last month.

The anniversary is coming up and this is already a traumatic time for those affected by the fire. Now we will have to commemorate the dead with the charred remains still dominating the skyline. Once again, we have been ignored and neglected.’A group called Grenfell United – which represents many of those affected by the inferno – claims it asked for the shroud to be green back in December.It is understood to have copies of emails to officials proving this.

It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

Scotland Yard, on the say-so of a since discredited middle-aged man called Nick, was probing what they believed were highly disturbing historical VIP child sex abuse claims in a huge investigation called Operation Midland.Nick had named Harvey Proctor as a child rapist, triple murderer and part of a sex ‘gang’ which included eminent Conservative political figures Sir Edward Heath and Lord Brittan, as well as a senior member of the Armed Forces.By mid-February 2015, Scotland Yard’s inquiry was gathering pace, and one of their officers had pronounced on a BBC broadcast that Nick’s allegations were both ‘credible and true’.          Adam, 30, pictured with Charlotte and Francesca said: ‘The first thing the police officer said was that he believed there was a baby in the house. He then said we must leave\u0027 A few weeks later, they would carry out what has become a notorious 15-hour police raid on Mr Proctor’s home.But that was not the first time the police turned up at rambling Barn House, which is sited down a long drive on Leicestershire’s Belvoir Castle estate, where the former MP worked for the owner, the Duke of Rutland, as private secretary.It was only the month before that the police officer and social worker had arrived with the baby seat to talk to the Coxons. They came when Harvey Proctor was away for a few hours collecting a Land Rover for the estate from Derbyshire.Adam, 30, says today: ‘The first thing the police officer said was that he believed there was a baby in the house. He then said we must leave.Police to stop taking victims\u0027 word for it: Dramatic plan...Share this article‘We now think he wanted us out of Harvey’s house so they could carry out the raid that happened a few weeks later, without us, and our baby, getting in the way.‘That day they came to see us, they were at Barn Farm for nearly three hours asking questions. I had to ring the Duke of Rutland’s partner, Andrea, for help because we had nowhere to go and live.’Charlotte was a care worker, while Adam had worked as a driver for the Duke and Duchess — who are estranged but both live at the castle — for around a decade. He also organised the musical entertainment for private functions enjoyed by the aristocratic family and their often famous guests.His closeness to the family who owned the estate was a lifeline that day.‘Andrea saved the day by offering to put us up in part of her house,’ says Adam.So it was that just after lunchtime, Charlotte, Adam and baby Francesca left — and were never to make it their home again. By then, Harvey Proctor had returned, and the couple set off in a convoy of cars. One was driven by Proctor, who was determined to support the couple and witness the unfolding events, another by Andrea, and a third contained the police officer and social worker.          Former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor pictured at a press conference to launch a book and criticise the \u0027bizarre\u0027 Scotland Yard inquiry into the VIP child sex abuseThey all made their way to the family’s new accommodation, a ten-minute journey away and just off the Belvoir estate. There, the officials kept up the inquisition.They asked if the couple knew the ‘history’ of their friend Harvey, and referred to the year 1987 when his distinctive face was plastered over front pages and TV after he was found guilty of gross indecency with rent boys.The Coxons replied that they did know, that indeed ‘everyone did’.The 1987 case had, anyway, involved homosexual dalliances with two consenting young men who were under 21 — an illegal act then, but not today, as the age of consent for homosexuality has been lowered to 16.So what on earth had that incident of years ago got to do with them and their three-month-old baby girl?‘We were terrified, though, in case they took Francesca,’ recalls Charlotte. ‘The police had searched Barn Farm and removed a baby sock with a picture of Tigger on it, among other personal things. It was terrible.‘We said Harvey was our friend and we were happy living with him in the same building. We had separate flats under the same roof, and only shared a kitchen with him and his partner, Terry.’Worse was to follow, though. As the questioning continued, the police officer and the social worker overheard Proctor saying he would pop back from Barn House later to make sure Adam, Charlotte and baby Francesca had settled into their new lodgings.The former MP was then startled to be told by the police officer that he must never see the baby again, according to legal papers prepared for Proctor’s £1 million claim for damages against Scotland Yard and his accuser ‘Nick’. The papers argue that it’s unlikely his trial of 1987 was the reason for this ban on having contact with the child.They say: The ‘inference is there to be drawn’ that it was based upon the ‘false and malicious’ VIP sex ring allegations by Nick against Mr Proctor, andor was demanded by Scotland Yard.The papers say the police officer, from the local Leicestershire force’s child protection squad, was also acting on the Yard’s instructions when he ‘falsely’ told Adam and Charlotte that their baby could be legally removed and put in care.Adam Coxon agrees. ‘I think this threat of losing our baby was made to frighten us so we would get out of Harvey’s house quickly. We think we were deliberately forced from our home under a false premise.’Charlotte adds: ‘We were never given any official paperwork from the police or the social worker about their threat of taking Francesca into care. There was no court order because there was no court hearing.          Former Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised to Mr Proctor for \u0027significant failings\u0027 in the Met\u0027s investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ringAs for the bewildered — and virtually homeless — Coxons, they were left to get on with their lives.By the summer of 2015, after the lengthy police raid on Harvey Proctor’s Barn Farm by ScotlandYard in March that year, they moved away from the Belvoir Castle area to live abroad in a Spanish village near Seville.‘We always wanted to spend the first year of Francesca’s life in Spain, but the threat to her made us do it,’ says Charlotte.‘We were happy at Barn Farm. We were a unit, but that was broken up.’Harvey Proctor has visited them there twice, and Francesca adores him. She calls him ‘Grandpa Harvey’ and can be seen in photos smiling happily with him.Francesca has settled into a local nursery school, has made friends, and speaks Spanish and English.Her little brother, Max, was born in a Spanish hospital in the autumn of last year, and also goes to the nursery in the village. Charlotte is now teaching English to children and adults who live nearby, while Adam, the son of a doctor, is looking for full-time work.The couple, who first met as teenagers, married in the Belvoir Castle private chapel in 2014 at the invitation of the Duke and Duchess.Today, they miss their old life in the shadow of one of England’s grandest homes, and they are determined to speak out about their ordeal at the hands of the police.They are also considering a claim for damages against Scotland Yard, Leicestershire Police and the local social services for forcing them from their home, threatening to take Francesca into care, and contributing to their decision to emigrate, which meant they lost their livelihoods in Britain.Charlotte said: ‘It is something we can’t just forget. We have never been back to the UK together as a family group because of the trauma of it. That means we miss our close relatives and friends in England.’Adam adds protectively: ‘I can still see that small car, that arrived with the police officer and the social worker, parked outside our house.‘It was silver with three doors and had the baby seat ready for Francesca. It is a sight that haunts us and always, always will.’So it is that the aftershocks from the historic sex allegations made by ‘Nick’ continue to shatter lives."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/18/4BBB205400000578-0-image-a-7_1525283607295.jpg","title":"Grenfell safety screen torn wrong colour","story":"    Builders have suspended the construction of a giant plastic sheet surrounding the burnt-out remains of the Grenfell TowerThe white shroud covering Grenfell Tower could be pulled down at a cost of £400,000 because it’s the wrong colour.Builders have suspended the construction of a giant plastic sheet surrounding the burnt-out remains of the tower because survivors and relatives of the dead want it to be green.Some are angry that the wrapping is white because the colour signifies mourning in some cultures. They also believe a white shroud will make it harder to spot on the skyline, sparking claims the tragedy could be forgotten.Instead they want it to be green, which is the colour that has been adopted by Grenfell survivors and campaign groups during vigils and marches, and on social media. Pulling down the sheeting and replacing it with a green one would cost up to £400,000, sources say.Officials had previously promised that the charred tower would be covered by early this year after psychologists warned that the sight of it was worsening the trauma of those living nearby.Scaffolding was put up in August – two months after the fire ripped through the building, killing 71.

A spokesman for the group said: ‘The tower should have been covered months ago.     The fire at Grenfell Tower in the Lancaster West Estate in North Kensington on June 14, 2017 caused 71 deaths and over 70 injuries\u0027Survivors, bereaved and the community agreed with the Government two things last year – that the tower would be covered and would be covered in green to reflect the wishes of the community and ensure that what happened would never be forgotten. \u0027Despite this agreement a white covering was put up without ever explaining why.\u0027Approaching the one-year anniversary the Government needs to resolve this quickly so that we can all keep moving forward with rebuilding our lives and our community.’Survivors voiced their concerns over the colour of the shroud in meetings last month with Home Office minister Nick Hurd.Last night a source close to him said: ‘He understands that there are concerns over the colour of the plastic sheeting and has met survivors to listen to their views.’Responsibility for the charred remains lies with a body called London Local Authority Gold.An LLAG spokesman said it has received some new proposals from the community recently and will ‘make a decision on the best way forward...in due course’.He added: ‘We continue to consult closely with the community. The wrapping of the tower is by its nature a sensitive issue and one which many people have understandably strong views on.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/14/4BD0F1E300000578-0-image-m-3_1525441627777.jpg","title":"The summer holiday price lottery Hotel packages 400 days|js slshare link","story":"    Booking a summer holiday online is a price lottery with the cost changing by more than £400 within just a few daysThe biggest difference was seen on a 14-night package holiday to Florida, staying at Disney’s Art of Animation Resort in Orlando, according to the research by currency experts FairFX. The price charged by Virgin Holidays ranged from a low of £6,708 to £7,141 over the 14 days – a difference of £433.Back in the summer of \u002778: Treasure trove of color images...Eeyore to be given a rest!

The Marxist philosopher was never arrested for the crime but instead spent four years at the Sainte-Anne hospital. Why? According to Israeli historian Shlomo Sand, such was French deference to its intellectuals that the establishment, including the justice minister and ENS alumnus Alain Peyrefitte, ignored the law. The supposition was simply not allowed “that a philosopher of Althusser’s status could have deliberately committed a murder so he had to be automatically considered mentally unbalanced”.Twenty years earlier, Jean-Paul Sartre benefited from similar attitudes. In 1960, the existentialist called on French soldiers to refuse to fight in Algeria’s war of independence. In response to those demanding Sartre’s prosecution, President de Gaulle said: “You do not arrest Voltaire.”For those of us who live on the other side of the Channel, French regard for intellectuals is puzzling. If, say, Germaine Greer had strangled her partner, or Richard Dawkins had incited fellow atheists to burn mosques and churches, you would suspect, they would be detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure, albeit with fat advances for their prison memoirs. Why the difference? Sand suggests anglophone anti-intellectualism is Protestantism’s legacy: since we got rid of Catholicism’s clerical hierarchy, we’ve been loth to replicate that authority with its secular counterpart. France’s intellectuals, by contrast, “have inherited both the role of the court jester, able to say whatever was in their minds without being punished, and of the priest, serving as intermediary between the believer and ine truth”.Sand starts his history with the Dreyfus affair and ends it, nauseated, in 2015, as the French establishment marches in solidarity with murdered workers at Muslim-baiting magazine Charlie Hebdo and there are calls for Michel Houellebecq to be inducted into the Académie Française for his novel Submission (one that imagines France busted down to a mere province of a Mediterranean caliphate). “The modern Parisian intellectual was born in the battle against Judeophobia, the twilight of the intellectual in the early 21st century is happening under the sign of a rise in Islamophobia,” Sand argues.Though many books have been written about the decline of the French intellectual, Sand’s is a welcome addition since it is written, not by a navel-gazing insider, but by someone by turns seduced and revolted by that Gallic neologism, les intellocrates. Now a professor of history in Tel Aviv, Sand started his working life making radio sets in Israel before studying in France and his blue-collar past haunts his thinking. His early scholarly work was on French syndicalist Georges Sorel, for whom workplace self-organisation was key to socialist revolution. Sand inherits his doubts that workers need to be led to communist paradise by soft-handed Left Bank scribblers.But first, when Sand read Albert Camus, Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, he was seduced. “I was bowled over by the romantic levity of those who lived from writing, by the idealisation of this intellectual commitment in the service of just causes, and against the enchanting backdrop of the City of Light.”Later, he was revolted. He came to believe that De Beauvoir and Sartre’s pro-Jewish posturing after the war was born of bad conscience for doing nothing effective to fight nazism or help Jews. Indeed, during the Nazi occupation, De Beauvoir signed a form denying she was a Jew in order to keep teaching at a lycée, while both she and Sartre neglected their former lover, Bianca Lamblin, a Polish Jew who holed up from the Gestapo in the south of France for the duration of the war. Sand snarls: “The ardent discussions on authenticity and existentialism in the cafes of Saint-Germain-des-Près left them no time to take an interest in the existential experience of their abandoned and persecuted lover, whose grandfather and aunt were murdered in the camps.”De Beauvoir’s Jewish lover Claude Lanzmann, too, gets indicted for his 1985 documentary Shoah. The film invites you to believe, Sand argues, “that the persecution of Jews (and of Jews alone) only took place east of the Rhine, and particularly in Poland, a country so ‘unintellectual’ and ‘antisemitic’”. The Jews interned by the French authorities at Drancy on their way to Auschwitz did not figure in Lanzmann’s portrait of the Holocaust, one that, for Sand at least, “so well agreed with the image that Parisian literati wanted to give of themselves”.What Sand’s book lacks, despite its refreshing absence of deference, is a sense of what made French intellectual production since the war so compelling. Lévi-Strauss, Barthes, Kristeva, Lacan, Derrida, Cixous, Deleuze and Guattari are scarcely mentioned and Foucault only gets a cameo. The Maoist philosopher Alain Badiou once told me that, while British postwar philosophy has its “côté somnifère” (its soporific aspect), French intellectual life in the same period has been a wild adventure. I’d like to read that adventure story, but Sand doesn’t tell it.Instead, he explores the embarrassing truth that, while in the new millennium the quality of French intellectual life has plummeted, its reputation remains. He bracingly compares media-friendly intellectuals such as Houellebecq, Éric Zemmour and Alain Finkielkraut to Nazi-collaborating writers such as Robert Brasillach and Pierre Drieu La Rochelle. Like such past figures, Sand argues, they cling to a France that is “totally imaginary” and yearn for it to be purified of the Other. In 1940 that meant Jews, in 2018 Islam.For Finkielkraut, author of The Unhappy Identity, the collapse of France’s educational system and high culture explain his homeland’s decline: “We no longer teach that the colonial project also sought to educate, to bring civilisation to savages,” he wrote. For Zemmour, author of The French Suicide, the problem is France has become too feminised, hedonistic and inidualistic. For both, as for Houellebecq, into France’s decadent vacuum steps the scary Other in the form of the racist projection of their own fears – the macho, barbaric Islamist bent on destroying everything French intellectuals, ostensibly, have held dear.Perhaps it takes an outsider Jew to diagnose the sickness of French intellectual life. Near the end of the book, Sand looks at a cartoon of Muhammad published in Charlie Hebdo, “a cruel-looking bearded figure wrapped in a white jellaba, his eyes hidden and holding a long pointed knife”. He has seen that image before. Where? In the Jew-hating cartoons published in the 1890s in La Libre Parole to whip up antisemitic sentiment during the Dreyfus affair. “It is surprising to see how much the ‘Semitic’ Jews of the past resemble the ‘Semitic’ Muslims of today: the same ugly face and the same long and fat nose.”No wonder, then, that when some 4 million French people joined the march for Charlie Hebdo’s murdered court jesters three years ago, Sand was not one of them. He is not the kind of guy to sport a “Je suis Charlie” badge – his admiration for French intellectuals, such as it is, does not extend to self-identifying with Islamophobes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/695f1a455396a5a4404759148c7c4e38bf06d7c6/16_144_3948_2370/master/3948.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2821a77280e14c0b7d066fbff16c1829","title":"balearic islands bank on sun to kickstart power drive renewables","story":"Local government wants to convert totally to renewables by 2050 but plan will not be easyAs thousands of holidaymakers fly into Menorca this summer, a glance out the window will illustrate the past and future of the island’s energy system.In the picturesque harbour of the capital, Mahón, where cruise ships dock alongside a marina full of luxury yachts, sits a pollution-belching, oil-fired power station inaugurated by Gen Franco more than half a century ago.On the other side of this Mediterranean isle lies row upon row of solar panels, tucked between traditional dry-stone walls.The Balearics, like many islands, are overwhelmingly reliant on costly, dirty fossil fuel imports for power, heat and transport. Wind, hydro and solar power provide about a third of Spain\u0027s electricity needs. Renewables grew rapidly in the country during the noughties but installations crashed in the face of government policy changes between 2012 and 2015. Retrospective changes to some schemes also put off investors. But the government held two auctions of renewable subsidies in 2017, which were mostly won by windfarms and solar projects, which are due to come online by 2020. Spain is second only to Germany in Europe for installed wind power capacity.Francina Armengol, the president of the Balearic government, said: “It’s not a political act, we haven’t done it to win votes. We believe it’s the right thing.”Large new car parks – the islands have some of the highest car ownership levels in Spain – will be ordered to fit solar power. New diesel cars will be banned from 2025, electric cars will be supported by charging points and street lights will be switched to LEDs.It will not be an easy transition. There are local and national obstacles to this vision. While the governments in the Balearics and Madrid, together with the tourist industry, energy companies, unions and ecologists are publicly agreed on the end destination, there are disagreements over the timetable.Citing energy security, Madrid has rejected the Balearic government’s proposal to gradually close the sizeable Es Murterar coal power station in Mallorca and fill the gap with existing gas capacity.Endesa, the company that runs coal, gas and oil plants on the islands, has suggested a compromise, with Es Murterar being mothballed but not dismantled. Some of the station’s 300 workers are unconvinced, despite promises of retraining and new job opportunities in the renewables business. “There will be no light and no jobs,” said one employee during a break outside the plant, which is adjacent to a natural park and only a few minutes’ walk behind the hotels and sandy beach of Alcudia Bay in the north-east of the island.There are also significant local challenges to the obvious alternative of more solar power.Residents have campaigned against solar projects because they are a blot on the landscape and because solar firms want agricultural land. As Marc Pons, the Balearic government’s energy minister, admits: “There is a lot of sensitivity in rural areas.”The main conservation group in Mallorca – GOB Mallorca – welcomes small solar schemes, especially on rooftops, but the spokesperson Margalida Ramis said it opposes large-scale solar farms that “are not about community but profit”.Scale, however, is necessary to make solar economics work here and to overcome other local challenges – such as land-leasing, which costs five times more than on the mainland.Jordi Quer, who runs a solar firm in Mallorca, is frustrated but determined. “We are just waiting for a solar industry here,” he said.In the meantime, local government is trying to kickstart the industry. Solar arrays have been fitted on scores of public buildings, from schools to hospitals. A further hurdle is the Balearics’ regulated energy market. The islands’ fossil fuel power station operators receive a €250-300m annual subsidy to compensate them for keeping residential energy prices the same as on the mainland. Solar park owners do not.Teresa Ribera, a former Spanish climate minister, said the use of public money should be an argument for “the best and cleanest options, not to waste the money in dirty options”.In Menorca, there are some more hopeful signs. Mahon’s oil power station is expected to switch to cleaner gas within two or three years. Conxa Junalola, the town’s mayor, said residents were “very worried” about the impact on their health from burning oil.While there is a core of local people opposing the solar park, which still awaits permission from Madrid for a grid connection, it is backed by the island’s influential green group. GOB Menorca wants to see more big solar farms, adapted to the landscape.And it is not only islanders calling for more renewables. Research by the tour operator Tui, a major presence on the islands, shows holidaymakers want hoteliers to use renewable energy.Madrid, which is believed to prefer expanding renewables on the mainland and upgrading undersea cables to export more of it to the Balearics, insisted it was not blocking the islands’ green plan. Talks between the Balearics and national government had been described as “productive”. Spain was advancing more renewables and decarbonising its energy system, an energy ministry spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de93e2bb8e15114d970b1f9417fe0c842e0e2e41/0_67_5202_3122/master/5202.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a71d4c4a71dc1f58c275249c0c1703f2","title":"royal wedding prince harry meghan markle 80m economy","story":"Pubs, retailers and landlords hopeful of bumper weekend to celebrate Harry and Meghan Markle’s weddingThe royal wedding could provide a shot in the arm of more than £80m for the country’s slowing economy as retailers, pubs and hoteliers look to cash in on Harry and Meghan’s looming nuptials.The tourist authority VisitBritain said about 50,000 Americans were expected to be among the crowds lining the roads in Windsor and soaking up the atmosphere in the capital when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot later this month. Pubs have been given special permission to stay open late while retailers in London’s shopping district are anticipating a £60m mini sales boom on the back of tourist spending sprees.“There could be a modest boost to GDP growth in the second quarter from the royal wedding and the football World Cup starting in mid-June,” said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to economic forecasting group the EY Item Club. “There may well be a temporary boost to retail sales from people buying souvenirs and also to tourism.”Airbnb said that with around 42,000 guest arrivals expected in London, hosts were set to rake in £12m from renting out their properties. In Windsor residents can earn £353 from the wedding weekend alone by using Airbnb to let their properties. The couple’s decision to get married in the grounds of Windsor Castle had also turned Slough, Maidenhead and Reading into rental hot spots, the company said.The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship.News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating.\u0026nbspKensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating. The prince attacks the media over its “abuse and harassment” of his girlfriend.\u0026nbspMarkle is spotted in London amid unconfirmed reports she is enjoying her first stay at Kensington Palace since the relationship was made public.\u0026nbspMarkle reportedly meets the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte for the first time in London.\u0026nbspThe engagement looks set when Markle graces the cover of US magazine Vanity Fair and speaks openly about Harry for the first time, revealing: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love.”\u0026nbspMarkle makes her first appearance at an official engagement attended by the prince when she attends the Invictus Games opening ceremony in Toronto, Canada – although the pair sit about 18 seats apart.\u0026nbspIt emerges that the prince has taken Markle to meet his grandmother, the Queen, whose permission they need to marry. They met over afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace.\u0026nbspThe prince’s aides are reported to have been told to start planning for a royal wedding, with senior members of the royal family asked to look at their diaries to shortlist a series of suitable weekends in 2018.\u0026nbspMarkle is spotted in London, prompting speculation she is preparing for an engagement announcement.\u0026nbspClarence House announces the engagement, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh say they are “delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”.With pub landlords given special permission to stay open until 1am on the eve of the nuptials, as well as on the day itself, the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association thinks the extended trading hours could deliver a £10m sales boost.“Relaxed licensing hours for pubs will be welcomed by pub-goers and provide a real boost to the pub trade,” said Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the BBPA – which represents the owners of 20,000 pubs. The wedding clashes with the FA Cup final between Manchester United and Chelsea, but while the wedding kicks off at noon the action does not start at Wembley until teatime – avoiding potential tussles over the big screen.Tim Martin, chair of JD Wetherspoon – which runs nearly 900 pubs, is less optimistic that the wedding will be good for business. “No disrespect to Harry and his missus but I can’t see the royal wedding moving the dial for the pub trade,” he said. “The public wish them all the best, but I feel the nuptials’ significance is overplayed.” There is optimism that the good weather ushered in by the bank holiday will hang around for the next fortnight: 19 May is too far away for the Met Office to have honed its forecast, but it warns that “confidence for a continuing warm dry spell is low” on its website. Online gambling firm Betway is offering odds of 1001 that the mercury will hit 100F (37.7C) on the big day.The country’s beleaguered retailers have been limbering up for the event since the engagement was announced at the end of last year with merchandise running the gamut from twee £12 tea-towels at John Lewis to Argos’s £14.99 rip-off of Markle’s engagement ring in cubic zirconia rather than diamonds.Markle has also been boosting the fortunes of British fashion retailers by mixing high street names such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Jigsaw into her designer wardrobe for public engagements.The big supermarkets are also expected to benefit as Britons host street parties and use the event as an excuse for a get-together. It is not clear how many street parties are taking place nationwide but the figure is likely to be in the hundreds, with Hertfordshire county council alone reporting 51 applications. VisitBritain said the pomp and pageantry associated with the royal family was part of the country’s appeal to overseas visitors, with the bride’s nationality an added bonus because American visitors are the UK’s highest spending overseas group.“We are looking at it as a showcasing moment on TV stations around the world,” said VisitBritain director Patricia Yates. “Our history and heritage is a huge draw internationally and this is an opportunity to reach a younger audience with a contemporary story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11ab9017cb435a525978913a789e7d5","title":"labour fudge brexit local elections leave remain corbyn","story":"It’s the May bank holiday weekend, and all is just as tradition demands. The sun is shining, the local election results are in, and Ken Livingstone is on the television talking about Hitler. To complete the spring picture, partisans and pundits are out in force, frantically spinning or interpreting the results of last night’s council contests in England, hoping to ine what the votes in 150 local authority areas portend for the nation’s future.So Tories can celebrate that not only did they hold on in key London boroughs that had seemed vulnerable, they also made gains outside the capital, from a bellwether like Redditch, in Worcestershire, and across the West Midlands, to Basildon and Peterborough. Labour can comfort itself with gaining Plymouth, and the fact that in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster it won more seats than at any time since 1986. But both parties would surely be wrong to read too much into any of these results, given that we’ve all seen how a completely different picture can emerge a matter of weeks later.Now, it’s true that you’d expect an opposition party to be trouncing a government in power for eight years and rocked by serial resignations, a visible inability to handle Brexit, and the shaming scandal of Windrush. But we know that Corbyn didn’t have the broadcast attention that clearly helped him last year, and that plenty of voters are simply not that engaged by local ballots. People may want to declare we’ve reached “peak Corbyn”, but it’s a stretch to do that on the basis of these results.Instead, you can make small, discrete observations about specific local situations. I’ll offer just one, related to the row over antisemitism in Labour. Plenty of those who’d always insisted the whole thing was invented, and a smear, also said that the mainstream Jewish organisations did not speak for the Jewish community when they sounded the alarm, that they were guilty of exaggerating the fears they claimed to represent, and that many Jews were, in fact, quite happy with Corbyn-led Labour. Well, now we have some pretty compelling data suggesting otherwise. In Barnet, but also in parts of Salford, Bury, Gateshead and Leeds, Jewish voters, including many who’d long backed Labour, told canvassers they could not vote for the party. And they didn’t.Labour’s base is more split, thriving with the younger, the more educated and the urban, many of whom are passionately anti-Brexit, while trying to hold on to older voters in post-industrial towns who backed leave with enthusiasm. There was more evidence of that fault line on Thursday, as Labour advanced in pro-remain Trafford but fell back in pro-leave Nuneaton and Derby.Until now, Labour has sought to ride these two horses at once, with the policy of “strategic ambiguity”. Last June it seemed to work, as Labour held on to its leave-voting seats even as it picked up remain strongholds like Canterbury and Kensington. But strategic ambiguity could be about to run out of road.The calculation here is not chiefly electoral, and certainly not based on these latest results. Rather it is based on both principle and practicality. Put simply, Labour will soon need to come off the Brexit fence – both because it should do and because it will have to.The practical urgency is that a series of Commons votes are looming in which Labour will have to take a clear stand. Even ahead of the crunch decisions in October, the Lords will vote on Tuesday on an amendment that would keep Britain in the single market. If that passes and comes before the Commons, would the Labour front bench move against it? If they did, what would their anti-Brexit supporters make of that: Labour acting to keep Britain out of the single market, with its protections of environmental and workers’ rights? The one option that won’t be available to the party leadership is more fudge.The principled case is more obvious. Labour is a pro-European party and understands that leaving both the single market and customs union would be a disaster for this country. It can argue that leaving the EU while staying in those institutions, in a kind of Norway-plus arrangement – with acceptance of free movement in principle, while working to modify its effects in practice, as other EU members do – would be a fair reflection of the 52-48 verdict of 2016. Out, but a little bit in.But wouldn’t that be electoral madness? What about all those leave areas represented by Labour MPs? As it happens, polls show that even among those Labour voters who backed leave, a plurality want Corbyn to commit to permanent membership of the customs union and single market. After all, breaking from those bodies was not on the ballot paper.Ambiguity served Labour well for a while. But it has outlived its usefulness and could soon become actively harmful, a worst-of-both-worlds position that pleases neither leavers nor remainers. Those who want Brexit will vote for the real thing, which means voting Tory those who oppose it will start looking around for a party that will do the same. In politics, “neither one thing nor another” has limited appeal: before long it begins to look a lot like nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1504c3ab093f4a17da9162c219ebb00832ea5d6/0_196_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960a18239c41b2575229e549b2790dee","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “It is categorically untrue that government is planning to ban the sale of hybrid cars in the UK by 2040.”The motor industry responded angrily to the news, saying it was disappointed to see policy being communicated by leaks.Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Unrealistic targets and misleading messaging on bans will only undermine our efforts to realise this future, confusing consumers and wreaking havoc on the new car market and the thousands of jobs it supports.“We cannot support ambition levels which do not appreciate how industry, the consumer or the market operate and which are based neither on fact nor substance.”When the 2040 ban was announced last summer, shortly after a similar plan by France, the UK government declined to be drawn on whether it covered hybrids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7371ac019ec718f8f7d00b2f51d9b4dd5e53c3b9/0_0_4119_2746/master/4119.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57d3d255dc0466cbe1277f42823f07ba 720w","title":"hiromasa yonebayashi interview studio ghibli mary and the witchs flower","story":"Mary and the Witch’s Flower director Hiromasa Yonebayashi on why Japanese directors go wild for Britain’s cuisine, climate, chintz – and unionised miners‘Clouds in Britain were very different from Japanese clouds,” says director Hiromasa Yonebayashi. “They seemed very close and they went on forever. They really stirred the imagination. I felt like those clouds had been an inspiration for British writers to create lots of fantasy works. It looked as if some hidden castle were about to emerge from them.”It’s rare the tourist who comes to Britain and enthuses about our overcast skies, but Yonebayashi and his team were on a mission. They were researching for their new animated feature Mary and the Witch’s Flower, based on the 1971 children’s book The Little Broomstick by Mary Stewart. The story is set in rural Shropshire, where a country girl’s discovery of a magical flower whisks her into a world of witchcraft and adventure. Yonebayashi opted to retain the original setting, so despite being Japanese in name and manufacture, the film feels quintessentially and unmistakably British, from the chintzy furnishings to the toaster in the kitchen to the herbaceous borders in the garden.Yonebayashi is best known for his films When Marnie Was There and Arrietty, both made with Studio Ghibli, Japan’s pre-eminent animation house. The announced retirement of Ghibli’s founder and resident genius auteur, Hayao Miyazaki (who subsequently changed his mind), prompted Yonebayashi to part ways and set up his own Studio Ponoc. The continuity is evident in the vibrant, hand-drawn animation and themes of prepubescent female self-identification, but also in the source material: all three of Yonebayashi’s movies have been based on books by British authors. When Marnie Was There was an adaptation of a 1967 novel by Joan G Robinson, while Arrietty was of Mary Norton’s classic The Borrowers. Those were transposed to Japanese settings, largely for the benefit of domestic audiences. Given the choice, Yonebayashi opted to set his latest in England. It was his first visit. “We were familiar with English scenery through such works as Peter Rabbit and Thomas the Tank Engine,” says Yonebayashi. “What was different from what we imagined was the colours of trees and leaves and flowers. So many different tones and shades!” From their bed and breakfast in Leintwardine, the director, his producer and art director toured the Shropshire area viewing local manor houses, thumbing the Yellow Pages for gardens to visit, asking locals what to see. Yonebayashi is full of enthusiasm, for the landscape, the hospitality he received, the soft fruits, even the cuisine. “We had an English breakfast every morning and it was fantastic. However, at times we felt that we wanted to eat something else.” Not even the constant rain fazed him. It reminded him of his home town in Ishikawa prefecture, roughly halfway along Japan’s northern coast. “There is a proverb in my region: even if you forget your packed lunch, don’t forget your umbrella.”Looking back, Studio Ghibli has always had a bit of a love-in with Europe in general, and Britain in particular. As a student, Miyazaki became interested in children’s literature, including the works of Rosemary Sutcliff and Philippa Pearce. Last year, he published a list of his 50 favourite children’s books – 20 of them were British. He made trips to Italy and Sweden in the 1970s when he was attempting (unsuccessfully) to adapt Heidi and Pippi Longstocking, and many of his early features have quasi-European settings, from his debut, Castle of Cagliostro (set in a fictional European state) to 1920s aviator tale Porco Rosso (set in the Adriatic) to Kiki’s Delivery Service, another tale of a girl witch, whose location was primarily modelled on Stockholm.Most intriguing of all is Miyazaki’s 1986 fantasy adventure Castle in the Sky, a tale of airborne pirates, technological terrors and a mythical floating city which does, indeed, emerge from the clouds (it is named Laputa, after the flying island in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels). The story’s boy hero lives in what looks like a 19th-century mining community. It is based on Wales, which Miyazaki first visited in 1984, just after the miners’ strike. The country seems to have struck a chord. “I really admired the way the miners’ unions fought to the very end for their jobs and communities, and I wanted to reflect the strength of those communities in my film,” he told an interviewer in 1999. “I saw so many places with abandoned machinery, abandoned mines – the fabric of the industry was there, but no people. It made a strong impression on me.” He also related to the Welsh and other Celtic people’s struggle for nationhood and cultural identity, in the face of outside invasion since Roman times. Two decades later, he adapted a novel by Welsh author Diana Wynne Jones, Howl’s Moving Castle.As with Hollywood, Japan’s anime and manga industries are so huge and prolific, they are constantly hungry for source material, so it is almost inevitable some are set in Britain. The Victorian, steampunk-friendly era is a particular favourite. Katsuhiro Otomo followed up his legendary Akira with 2004’s Steamboy, set in Victorian Manchester and London and taking in the Great Exhibition of 1851. Black Butler, AKA Kuroshitsuji, is a supernatural spy tale that crosses paths with Queen Victoria and Jack the Ripper. Emma follows a servant girl in class-conscious 1850s London. Read or Die centres on an agent for the “special operations ision of the British Library”.Here in the UK, we may question why Japanese animators are more engaged with our rich literary heritage than the domestic film industry seems to be. There is often uproar when Hollywood co-opts Japanese stories and culture, such as the recent remake of Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell, or Netflix’s US-set adaptation of hit manga Death Note. Isn’t this the same thing? Should we be affronted? Not if it’s done in the right way, Yonebayashi says. “When we create works based on overseas culture, we really want to respect their countries and the original concepts the author wanted to portray.” By the same token, he appreciated Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation, which viewed modern Tokyo with the same curiosity he viewed Shropshire.Yonebayashi remains on good terms with Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, he says. He worked there for 20 years before setting up on his own, and his latest film looks and feels like a continuation of Ghibli’s work. Asked to make a distinction, he suggests: “The late Studio Ghibli works tend to end with departures. However, when creating movies for children currently, I thought it was more important to show encounters than partings.” The sentiment feels in tune with his cultural eclecticism.Perhaps we should be grateful. Films such as Mary and the Witch’s Flower are expensive and time-consuming to make, with their painstakingly hand-rendered images and attention to detail. They are an endangered art, which is why few countries outside Japan still make them. It is hard to imagine anyone could have done a better job. If Britain no longer has the industry, it at least has the stories.Next, Yonebayashi has his eye on Scottish writer Alex Shearer. “I’ve read all his works, and I would really, really love to make a film out of one of his books.” This time, at least, we Brits beat them to it: BBC adapted Shearer’s story Bootleg into a Bafta-winning miniseries in 2002. Mind you, it was also made into a Japanese anime feature in 2008.• Mary and the Witch’s Flower is now on release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94daace729bdf803cdf2c69af1c64a6398a9b9fd/200_0_2750_1651/master/2750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c85c137b2733692123f4795779723d","title":"top four massive progress liverpool jurgen klopp","story":"• Finalists not sure of place in Champions League next season• Chelsea could apply pressure with win at Stamford BridgeJürgen Klopp believes if Liverpool can secure a Champions League berth for a second successive season it would show “massive” progress.Back from their qualification in Rome for the Champions League final, Liverpool are at Chelsea on Sunday needing a point to secure a top-four finish.Asked what it would mean to qualify for Europe’s premier club competition for a second year running for the first time since 2009, Klopp said: “It would be massive. It was actually the main target we had at the start of the season. You want to be champions but it was clear after a few months that would not be possible.“The target is qualifying for the Champions League. That would be a big success. With the group we’ve got, with how we came to the final and playing with the biggest intensity, being ready again, then the injuries we had, it would be a massive success.“It’s exactly what we want. You cannot plan for a Champions League final obviously. Nobody thought about that at the start of the season. Of course we wanted to go as far as possible but my main target was the top four. We worked hard for that and now we want to bring it over the line.“If we do it, it would show everything but it’s still an if. I don’t like the word ‘would’ too much. Let’s talk about it when it happens. We have to play football games to make that happen.”Liverpool defeated Roma 7-6 on aggregate having eliminated Manchester City, the Premier League champions, 5-1 in the quarter-finals and Klopp believes the European Cup and domestic campaigns have battle-hardened his players.“They have developed a lot,” he said. “It’s been a difficult season for a lot. Inidually there have been struggles here and there but we have really stayed strong in our relationship and remained on track. Without that we couldn’t be here. Third in the league and in the Champions League final. That wouldn’t be possible.“It’s all about the players and what they did so far is absolutely exceptional. The problem is that Sunday is also important.”Klopp welcomed how the challenge becomes tougher as Liverpool become more successful. “That’s absolutely true,” he said. “It’s the situation we’re in. We brought ourselves into it in a positive way.“In a negative way we brought ourselves into it by not winning the three league games against Everton, West Brom and Stoke.

The defeat left the manager questioning whether his players were as desperate as he is to secure a top-two finish.“It was not good enough,” said Mourinho, who had made six changes to his lineup and asked those selected to impress before the FA Cup final. “The players who replaced others did not perform at a good level and, when iniduals do that, it is difficult for the team to play well. “Maybe now you will not ask me why A, B and C do not play so much. People always ask: ‘Why always Lukaku?’ Well, now they know why always Lukaku, and why always this player and why always that player. We are probably not as good as people think we are inidually.“I knew what was going to happen, and I told them, but that is what we got. Brighton had one target, to get the point and celebrate their Premier League survival. Our target was to get points to help us finish second and they clearly showed that, for them, it is more important for them to stay in the Premier League than for us to finish second. They showed it from the first minute and we didn’t show that. We were not able to motivate ourselves.”Mourinho added: “For me that’s always disappointing because that’s not me. And if my players want to be honest and fair, which I think they want ... if you ask them they will tell you how long I spoke ... during the week, trying to anticipate the scenario and trying to persuade them that the only way to compete against a team like Brighton is to have the same commitment and ambition they have. “We were not ready to prove that second position is important for us. I am disappointed because second is important for me.

By Colin CrummyClaire Ratinon, 34, was working in TV production in New York when she stumbled across Brooklyn Grange, an acre of rooftop farm seven storeys up in Queens. “I looked across at the Manhattan skyline while standing among kale, peppers and tomatoes, growing in the middle of the sky, and fell in love,” she says. Ratinon, from Surrey, started volunteering, picking tomatoes and getting sunburnt. It sowed the seed of something: “It was the calmest, cleanest place in the city and somewhere my soul was saying, this is where you need to spend more time.”Brooklyn Grange appeared at the right time in Ratinon’s life. After three years living in the US, she had begun to question what she was eating. The urban farm, where everything is grown organically, showed Ratinon a different way of food production. She took time off work and spent several months there with other apprentices, learning how to grow crops organically, before moving back to London in late 2014. There, she sought out growing communities and trained as a patchwork farmer at the Hackney-based social enterprise Growing Communities – growing salads at one of nine small market gardens – and as a beekeeper and gardener at the Bee Friendly Trust charity. She was also the lead gardener on Farmopolis, an ambitious arts space with a garden created from thousands of donated plants from the 2016 Chelsea flower show.There is huge potential in urban food growing, she says, and she is determined to be at the forefront. “Urban soil is some of the richest we have because it isn’t subjected to the pesticide and fertiliser that industrialised systems mete out on the countryside.”With organic growing, she says, “you are producing food without taking anything else away. Your whole practice is about working with nature and enriching the environment at the same time as feeding people. I feel very passionate about that.” In the meantime, she is spending the summer on an organic farm in Wiltshire, harvesting asparagus. Ratinon is also drawn to the therapeutic potential in urban farming. “When I walk into an urban growing space there’s a sense of relief,” she says. “They feel like some of the safest, most beautiful spaces I’ve been into.”Favourite plant Tomatoes. They taste approximately one thousand times better than any you’d get in the supermarket. Tumbling Toms can be grown really easily.Hates Slug pellets.

They are drawn to his daily updates from his day job as plantsman at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London. His posts of roses, bluebells and the occasional peacock celebrate the traditional English garden in an intoxicating blend of blooms and borders.Real life is not quite as rosy. “It’s an absolute nightmare for dating,” Hoyle says of his dedication to the role, “because you have to find someone who is like-minded. They have to love plants, and that can be tricky. Even though they think it’s romantic and wonderful, there’s the reality of having to look after the plants – and sometimes the plants come first.”Hoyle’s love affair with the English garden dates back to a childhood spent in the Cotswolds. His late mother was a gardener, the family patch part of the National Garden Scheme. “It’s just there,” he says of the desire to dig. “You suddenly want to be outside, you have a sense of pride and ownership.” So he worked at a local nursery during school holidays and visited Chelsea with his grandparents. (“I was in awe,” he says.) He went to plant fairs, collected pelargoniums, and at 16, began studies in horticulture at Pershore College, Worcestershire.It was Hoyle’s first gardening job, age 11 at a local 17th-century manor house, that settled the matter. “That got me going at first it was mowing grass, clearing up fallen fruit and squashing lily beetles,” Hoyle says. “The vicar used to pay me 20p a beetle. I had small hands that caught them quickly.”After completing his first horticultural course, Hoyle spent two years working at Aberglasney Gardens in Carmarthenshire, west Wales. The head gardener was Kew-trained and encouraged Hoyle to take up further study. He studied the Kew Diploma for three years before securing a permanent position there, helping to manage the Rose Garden, the Great Broad Walk Borders, Palm House pond and Victoria Gate entrance. These are some of Kew’s choicest spots, which Hoyle shows off to his online following.Hoyle’s passion has taken him around the world. A tour of rose gardens in America included the White House, accessed through American gardening friends. He is preparing for a similar rose-centred tour of Australia and there is a book in the works.He’s clearly set for big things, but for now, he says, the plan is to stay at Kew. “I consider myself a plantsman, finding solutions and working with designers,” he says.

A good cut is really important.Next big thing Big borders mixed borders where you plant trees, shrubs, bulbs, all together in one space.Huw Richards’ most popular Facebook post is a 60-second tutorial on how to grow vegetables, which has been viewed 6.6m times. “I was sharing a method of growing beans where you grow them in a rain gutter and slide them out into a raised bed,” says the 19-year-old. “People seemed to love that and it just completely blew up.”His YouTube channel, Huw’s Nursery, shows how to grow organic produce at home for a fraction of the supermarket cost, with tips on picking hard-to-reach fruit (130k views), cheap soil nutrients (388k views), and growing potatoes the lazy way (1m views). The site has 82k subscribers.Richards built his social media profile while boarding on scholarship at Llandovery College. A head boy there, he gardened, filmed and edited in his spare time (he’s produced more than 400 videos). He was awarded a £5,000 grant to promote sustainable food, won a national young entrepreneur award and made £12,000 by his 18th birthday. He listens to the podcasts of entrepreneurial self-help guru Gary Vaynerchuk while in the garden. “Gary’s been the biggest influence in my life,” he says. “He’s very strategic and tries to push positivity. His mindset has really helped me develop.”Despite getting three Bs in his A-levels, Richards did not apply to university but dedicates most of his time to Huw’s Nursery while working part-time teaching gardening at his former school. The long-term plan is the big time. “I’d love to be a gardening presenter because I think I’d appeal to a younger demographic,” Richards says. “The average age of gardening presenters and writers is a lot older than I am. I’ve been doing this all by myself. I’ve had 20m views online.”Richards has met a number of production companies, a management agency and a publisher this year. But some opportunities he is minded to decline. “On my Facebook page, some older ladies wanted me to do a topless gardener calendar,” he laughs. “But I don’t think so.”Favourite plant Rainbow chard.

It goes really well with stronger-flavoured foods and grows well in our climate.The powerful partnership of Tamara Bridge and Kate Savill, both 30, is rare in usually male-centric gardening circles. Both run inidual, award-winning garden design practices, but also collaborate on show gardens. In 2017, they pooled their talents for a BBC Radio 2 Feel Good Garden at Chelsea this year they are back to create an artisan garden for a craft gin company. “Architects work together in big practices so why should it be different with garden designers?” says Bristol-based Savill.The pair met in competition at RHS Tatton Park flower show in 2015 where they were both up for Young Designer of the Year. Bridge won, and Savill was awarded a gold medal – not bad for her first show garden. The two hit it off when they spent three weeks living side by side in a camper van (Bridge) and a tent (Savill) at the show. “It started off just Tamara and me in a field, two girls cracking on for weeks,” says Savill.Collaborating has been a great creative experience, says Bridge, whose practice is based in Norfolk. “Partnerships can be seen as quite a sparky relationship, but we are the opposite, we get calmer.” They consult each other on their inidual projects and say working together only adds to the sum of the work, even if Savill tends to have the final tweak.“Kate waits till I’ve gone off site,” Bridge laughs. “I get quite stressed about changing things on site so she’ll wait until I’ve gone and sneak in.” In her defence, Savill always makes her partner aware of the alterations.For their Chelsea show, Bridge and Savill are heading a team of 22, which splits squarely on gender lines: the construction side is exclusively male, the planters mostly women. The construction team gets paid first and the planters only if budget allows. The women, therefore, tend to be volunteers. It’s accepted practice generally, say Bridge and Savill, but it’s beginning to get their goat. “Why is it acceptable for a project to run like that?” says Bridge. “The next time we do this it’s at the top of our list of things that won’t happen. It does make me quite cross.”Favourite plant Bridge: I love a wild strawberry. Chives are great because the flower is edible and you can pull it off and sprinkle it on your salad for a spring onion taste.Hates Bridge: bad lawn edges. I like a nice crisp edge with no tufty bits. If you have a flowerbed with an edge on the lawn, it needs to be neat and tidy.Next big thing Savill: crazy paving is making a big wave at the moment.Lachlan Rae is living the good life on a grand scale. The 25-year-old gardener lives in a cottage on the private Auchendolly estate, near Aberdeen in Scotland, with his wife and three young children, all under the age of six. “It’s a lovely big garden for me to take ownership of,” says Rae, who is originally from Dumfries. “You walk out of the door and you’re at your work. It’s a nice way to live.’Working alone or with his wife, Sian, Rae insists on traditional horticultural practices where possible. “I like to think of myself as an arts and crafts gardener. There’s no automated watering, it’s all watering cans. Instead of using plastic canes everywhere, I cut hazel twigs up in the woods and use that for staking plants to keep the environmental footprint down.”Rae left school at 16 and took seasonal work as a Christmas tree cutter and then a self-employed gardener, where his lack of expertise exasperated him. “People were asking me questions I couldn’t answer.” After taking a local gardening course he enrolled on the horticulture with plantsmanship course at the Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh. The academic grounding helped Rae win last year’s Young Horticulturalist of the Year, a national competition run by the Institute of Horticulture which tests the scholarly mettle of gardeners under 30 across categories that include horticultural science and practice plus plant, pest and weed identification.These wider aspects of gardening often go overlooked, says Rae. “There’s a lot more to horticulture than just gardening there’s a lot of science and it’s artistic,” he says. ‘I don’t know that the message is out there about the range of jobs. Gardening is just seen as pushing a wheelbarrow about all day. Schools are at fault it’s seen as a career for the no-hopers.”Rae moves to a new role this month as head gardener on Wiston Estate, in West Sussex. He will be in charge of a four-person team, all under 25, that will maintain 17 acres of public gardens. “It’s just what I need, a new challenge.”Favourite plant Cercidiphyllum japonicum, also known as the katsura tree. It’s not a beauty but it has small flowers which come out en masse in a faint ripple of colour.Hates Plastic green string you get in garden centres. It’s horrible. I prefer jute twine, which is a bit more rustic and natural.Grow now Plants with purpose like cut-and-come again salads, which can be grown on windowsills.Ula Maria Bujauskaite’s gardens are infused with ideas about time, memory, connections. Stepping into one should feel like a holiday from life. “When I design someone’s garden, it’s important to look at what inspires them and what kind of environment they feel happiest in,” says the 25-year-old RHS Young Designer of the Year 2017. “People draw from their experiences of being on holiday or from their childhood, time spent in nature. A lot of my work is an interpretation of that happy place in the garden.”Bujauskaite’s award-winning garden, Studio Unwired – shown at last year’s RHS Tatton Park flower show – drew inspiration from her own happy place, the Baltic coastline of her childhood. She created an outdoor working space informed by the earthy, serene summers of the Lithuanian seaside.Bujauskaite knew from childhood that she wanted to pursue design. She attended the Fine Arts School in Lithuania from age 12 until her family moved to Northampton in 2008, and she took a 3D design course in Milton Keynes followed by one in Landscape Architecture at Birmingham City University. There she was awarded the Landscape Institute’s John Knight award twice, for degree and master’s projects.The personal connections in Bujauskaite’s work first surfaced here her master’s explored the benefits of garden spaces for patients in palliative care. “I was 17 when my mum passed away from cancer. I had to spend a lot of time in a hospice with her and I wished there was a garden to walk out into and just spend some time in,” she says. The therapeutic aspects of colour, texture and how a garden view can offer relief to patients are elements Bujauskaite would like to touch on again in future work. “A garden can change people’s experience of going through something sad or horrible,” she says.Favourite plant Grasses: at sales, people pick the bright colours and all the grasses are left behind, which I love most.Grow now If you live in a flat, grow herbs like rosemary or mint or anything flowering that would enliven the space.Next big thing Wabi-sabi, from Japanese culture, is seeing beauty in imperfection. The cracks in timber or paving can be beautiful, too, because they show the ageing or time passing by. Will Williams, 22, had a rude awakening to gardening. At 16, having left school, he got a job with a local landscape gardener in Sussex. The 5.30am start and 12-hour working days were a steep learning curve. “It matured me very quickly,” he says. “I remember a lorry dumped four tonnes of sand at the front of a terraced house. I was passed a spade and a bucket and told to get all the sand round the back. That was a long day.”He has advanced remarkably quickly since. His passion for gardening deepening, he took a local course near his family home in Sussex. At 18, having saved half the fees, with the remainder paid by his parents, Williams became the youngest diploma student at London College of Garden Design. He went it alone after graduating, specialising in residential garden design, freelancing for his “bread and butter”, then winning projects against industry veterans. “I had nothing to risk, and in five years’ time I probably would have, so it was the perfect time to show the industry what I’ve got at quite an early age by myself,” Williams says.Williams’ next show sees him up for the RHS Young Designer of the Year 2018 (the winners are announced in July). At One is a show garden about balance, pleasing to humans and attractive to bees, butterflies and bugs. His ultimate ambition is a main avenue garden at Chelsea flower show. And while he is still young (a landscaper once refused to work with him because he looked so fresh-faced), Williams believes starting so early has been to his advantage. “Lots of people are career changers so they might not have as much experience as I do,” he says. “This is all I have really known from the age of 16. My youth hasn’t stopped me yet.”Favourite plant The amelanchier tree.

After all, there is a significant minority who are quite badly affected by sulphites, yet there’s not nearly as much discussion about that as there is about, say, gluten intolerance.Sulphites feature in most wines whites more than reds, and sweet wines significantly more than both. They prevent oxidation (that is, they stop the juice turning brown), they keep wines stable (important when they have to travel) and they preserve their bright, fresh fruit flavours. The downside is that higher levels can, in some people, provoke headaches and breathing difficulties, though headache can of course also be triggered by the amount you drink.Even if a wine has no added sulphur (often referred to on the label as NAS), it may well contain some naturally occurring or “free sulphur” as a result of the fermentation process. It’s really the total level you need to be concerned about, which, under EU regulations, can be up to 400mg per litre in the case of sweet wines (200mg per litre is the maximum for whites and 150mg for reds). Natural wine bars will generally stock wines that are a good deal lower than that – in the case of Plateau in Brighton, for example, they aim for 30mg per litre.The bad news for those who are looking for NAS wines is that they are not that widely available, they’re generally quite expensive and, if you’re used to the bright fruit flavours of conventionally made wines, you may even not like them (that said, like low-sulphur wines, they generally benefit from decanting).There is, however, a device called Üllo that is designed to remove sulphites from standard wines (currently £69.99, plus extra for the filters). The makers aren’t specific about how, exactly, that works, but the good news is that, from a taste point of view, it has no impact and, if anything, clarifies and brightens wines poured through it. It made a slightly rough-and-ready Romanian syrah, for instance, taste quite a bit better, but that may have simply been the effect of aerating it. In the small print at the bottom of the home page, however, it says, “Üllo is not intended to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent reactions to sulphites”, which makes you wonder what the point of the device is. The website also advises those who suffer from an allergy or sensitivity to sulphites to consult a doctor before using the Üllo. All I’m saying is that it exists, so it’s an option.

No wonder there’s a persistent rumour that Facebook uses the microphone in your phone to eavesdrop on your conversations. That’s almost certainly false: the truth is that apps and websites already vacuum up so much of your data, they’ve no need for such schemes it just feels that they must be eavesdropping. But there’s another reason Big Tech knows us so much better than we think, which is that each of us is far more normal than we realise.Given a little information about me, both Facebook and my friend alight on the same recommendation because my constellation of interests is far less special, and thus more predictable, than I’d like to\u0026nbspbelieve.“You’re not so special” is a message sometimes delivered as an insult (as in “special snowflake”) and sometimes as tough love, as in the viral 2012 speech by the American high-school teacher David McCullough, urging students not to make themselves miserable by struggling to prove they’re the centre of the universe. It’s also frequently an accusation flung at the young by the old.But all that’s really just a distraction from the brute statistical fact: on any given dimension, all else being equal, of course you’re probably normal. Shorn of any value judgment, that’s all the word “normal” means. Your intelligence, your creativity, your tastes in culture or romantic partners, the degree to which the world has mistreated you: the chances are they’re much less quirky or extreme than you think, especially since we’ve each got strong ulterior motives to believe otherwise. Or to put it another way: thinking you’re special is just one more way in which you’re normal. This is the famous Lake Wobegon phenomenon known as “illusory superiority”, which explains why most people think they’re above average at driving, at being unbiased, and various other things. Though it works the other way, too: imposter syndrome is a classic case of thinking\u0026nbspyou’re special, but in a\u0026nbspnegative way.The trouble is that both the positive and negative forms of thinking you’re less normal than you are lead to misery – either by convincing you you’re unusually bad, or by turning life into an isolating, adversarial exercise in maintaining your sense of being unusually good. The latter also means that any aspect of your life or experience that’s just ordinary – which, by definition, is going to be most of them – feels like an affront to your identity. “Never forget that every mind is shaped by the most ordinary experiences,” wrote the French poet Paul Valéry. “To say that something is ordinary is to say it is of the kind that has made the biggest contribution to the formation of your most basic ideas.” To disdain the normal means disdaining most of what happens. Doing that is pretty normal, too, to be honest. But it’s a recipe for a joyless life.• Read: Nothing Special, by the late American Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck, is a perspective-shifting exploration of what’s so remarkable about the everyday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14c42fbbc71bf1b6ce5552183fed429441be0f42/1328_1037_3873_2324/master/3873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=760a3efffdead65001fbb70dccb6f2ad","title":"thomasina miers recipe sea bream anchoiade crust hasselback potatoes","story":"This anchovy-topped fish is covered in a crunchy crumb and served with crisp yet velvety jersey royalsIs bread having a renaissance?

Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Put a potato on to a tablespoon or wooden spoon and, using a small, sharp knife, make incisions at 2-3mm intervals along the potato without cutting all the way through – the spoon helps stop your knife cutting all the way down. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes.Melt the butter in a small pan. Put the potatoes in a baking tin, season with salt and pepper, and toss in the butter, thyme and oil. Roast for 35-45 minutes, (the time will depend on the size of the potatoes), basting the potatoes in the fat a few times during cooking.Meanwhile put the anchovies, capers, garlic, egg yolks and oil in a medium-sized bowl and blitz to a smooth emulsion with a handheld blender. Taste and check for seasoning – the anchovies will provide the salt, but a few generous grinds of black pepper will make all the difference. Line a baking tray with greased baking paper or foil, and put the fish fillets on top.Wash the parsley, pick the leaves (discarding the stems) and finely chop. Toss into the breadcrumbs and chilli flakes. Spread a heaped teaspoon of the anchovy emulsion over the skin of each fillet, followed by a generous layer of parsley breadcrumbs. When the potatoes are almost ready, drizzle the fillets with a little oil (about two teaspoons), then roast alongside the potatoes as the potatoes for 10-12 minutes (or longer, if you have a thicker fillet of cod or hake), until the breadcrumbs are golden and toasted and the fish gently flakes. Serve the fish and the golden potatoes with a crisp, green salad and a wedge of lemon.Thankfully, you will have some anchovy mayonnaise left, and it is wonderful on a chargrilled steak or lamb chop and great with crudités (think fennel wedges, red pepper and chicory).

Inventing meaningless tasks for others. Just looking busy. Why do so many people feel their work is completely unnecessary?One day, the wall shelves in my office collapsed. This left books scattered all over the floor and a jagged, half-dislocated metal frame that once held the shelves in place dangling over my desk. I’m a professor of anthropology at a university. A carpenter appeared an hour later to inspect the damage, and announced gravely that, as there were books all over the floor, safety rules prevented him from entering the room or taking further action. I would have to stack the books and not touch anything else, whereupon he would return at the earliest available opportunity.The carpenter never reappeared. Each day, someone in the anthropology department would call, often multiple times, to ask about the fate of the carpenter, who always turned out to have something extremely pressing to do. By the time a week was out, it had become apparent that there was one man employed by buildings and grounds whose entire job it was to apologise for the fact that the carpenter hadn’t come. He seemed a nice man. Still, it’s hard to imagine he was particularly happy with his work life.Everyone is familiar with the sort of jobs that don’t seem, to the outsider, really to do much of anything: HR consultants, communications coordinators, PR researchers, financial strategists, corporate lawyers or the sort of people who spend their time staffing committees that discuss the problem of unnecessary committees. What if these jobs really are useless, and those who hold them are actually aware of it? Could there be anything more demoralising than having to wake up in the morning five out of seven days of one’s adult life to perform a task that one believes does not need to be performed, is simply a waste of time or resources, or even makes the world worse? There are plenty of surveys about whether people are happy at work, but what about whether people feel their jobs have any good reason to exist? I decided to investigate this phenomenon by drawing on more than 250 testimonies from people around the world who felt they once had, or now have, what I call a bullshit job.The defining feature is this: one so completely pointless that even the person who has to perform it every day cannot convince themselves there’s a good reason for them to be doing it. They may not be able to admit this to their co-workers – often, there are very good reasons not to do so – but they are convinced the job is pointless nonetheless.Bullshit jobs are not just jobs that are useless typically, there has to be some degree of pretence and fraud involved as well. The employee must feel obliged to pretend that there is, in fact, a good reason their job exists, even if, privately, they find such claims ridiculous.When people speak of bullshit jobs, they are generally referring to employment that involves being paid to work for someone else, either on a waged or salaried basis (most would include paid consultancies). Obviously, there are many self-employed people who manage to get money from others by means of falsely pretending to provide them with some benefit or service (normally we call them grifters, scam artists, charlatans or frauds), just as there are self-employed people who get money off others by doing or threatening to do them harm (normally we refer to them as muggers, burglars, extortionists or thieves). In the first case, at least, we can definitely speak of bullshit, but not of bullshit jobs, because these aren’t “jobs”, properly speaking. A con job is an act, not a profession. People do sometimes speak of professional burglars, but this is just a way of saying that theft is the burglar’s primary source of income.These considerations allow us to formulate what I think can serve as a final working definition of a bullshit job: a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence, even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.They are given some minor task to justify their existence, but this is really just a pretext: in reality, flunky jobs are those that exist only or primarily to make someone else look or feel important. A classic flunky is someone like Steve, who told me, “I just graduated, and my new ‘job’ basically consists of my boss forwarding emails to me with the message: ‘Steve refer to the below’, and I reply that the email is inconsequential or spam.”Doormen are the most obvious example. They perform the same function in the houses of the very rich that electronic intercoms have performed for everyone else since at least the 1950s. In some countries, such as Brazil, some buildings still have uniformed elevator operators whose entire job is to push the button for you. Further examples are receptionists and front-desk personnel at places that obviously don’t need them. Other flunkies provide a badge of importance. These include cold callers, who make contact with potential clients on the understanding that the broker for whom they work is so busy making money that they need an assistant to make this call.These are people whose jobs have an aggressive element but, crucially, who exist only because other people also employ people in these roles. The most obvious example of this are national armed forces. Countries need armies only because other countries have armies if no one had an army, armies would not be needed. But the same can be said of most lobbyists, PR specialists, telemarketers and corporate lawyers.Goons find their jobs objectionable not just because they feel they lack positive value, but also because they see them as essentially manipulative and aggressive. These include a lot of call-centre employees: “You’re making an active negative contribution to people’s day,” explained one anonymous testimony. “I called people up to hock them useless shit: specifically, access to their ‘credit score’ that they could obtain for free elsewhere, but that we were offering, with some mindless add-ons, for £6.99 a month.”These employees’ jobs exist only because of a glitch or fault in the organisation they are there to solve a problem that ought not to exist. The most obvious examples of duct-tapers are those whose job it is to undo the damage done by sloppy or incompetent superiors.Many duct-taper jobs are the result of a glitch in the system that no one has bothered to correct – tasks that could easily be automated, for instance, but haven’t been either because no one has got around to it, or because the manager wants to maintain as many subordinates as possible, or because of some structural confusion.Magda’s job required her to proofread research reports written by her company’s star researcher-statistician. “The man didn’t know the first thing about statistics, and he struggled to produce grammatically correct sentences. I’d reward myself with a cake if I found a coherent paragraph. I lost 12lb working in that company. My job was to convince him to undertake a major reworking of every report he produced. Of course, he would never agree to correct anything, so I would then have to take the report to the company directors. They were statistically illiterate, too, but, being the directors, they could drag things out even more.”These employees exist only or primarily to allow an organisation to be able to claim it is doing something that, in fact, it is not doing. The most miserable thing about box-ticking jobs is that the employee is usually aware that not only does the box-ticking exercise do nothing towards accomplishing its ostensible purpose, but also it undermines it, because it erts time and resources away from the purpose itself.We’re all familiar with box-ticking as a form of government. If a government’s employees are caught doing something very bad – taking bribes, for instance, or shooting citizens at traffic lights – the first reaction is invariably to create a “fact-finding commission” to get to the bottom of things. This serves two functions. First of all, it’s a way of insisting that, aside from a small group of miscreants, no one had any idea that any of this was happening (this, of course, is rarely true) second, it’s a way of implying that once all the facts are in, someone will definitely do something about it (this usually isn’t true, either).Local government has been described as little more than an endless sequence of box-ticking rituals revolving around monthly “target figures”. There are all sorts of ways that private companies employ people to be able to tell themselves they are doing something that they aren’t really doing. Many large corporations, for instance, maintain their own in-house magazines or even television channels, the ostensible purpose of which is to keep employees up to date on interesting news and developments, but which, in fact, exist for almost no reason other than to allow executives to experience that warm and pleasant feeling that comes when you see a favourable story about yourself in the media.These fall into two groups. Type one comprises those whose role consists entirely of assigning work to others. This job can be considered bullshit if the taskmaster believes there is no need for their intervention, and that if they were not there, underlings would be perfectly capable of carrying on by themselves.Whereas the first variety of taskmaster is merely useless, the second variety does actual harm. These are taskmasters whose primary role is to create bullshit tasks for others to do, to supervise bullshit, or even to create entirely new bullshit jobs.“Strategic mission statements” (or, even worse, “strategic vision documents”) instil a particular terror in academics. These are the primary means by which corporate management techniques – setting up quantifiable methods for assessing performance, forcing teachers and scholars to spend more and more of their time assessing and justifying what they do, and less and less time actually doing it – are insinuated into academic life.I should add that there is really only one class of people who not only deny their jobs are pointless, but also express outright hostility to the very idea that our economy is rife with bullshit jobs. These are – predictably enough – business owners and others in charge of hiring and firing. No one, they insist, would ever spend company money on an employee who wasn’t needed. All the people who are convinced their jobs are worthless must be deluded, or self-important, or simply don’t understand their real function, which is fully visible only to those above. One might be tempted to conclude from this response that this is one class of people who genuinely don’t realise their own jobs are bullshit.These holders of bullshit jobs testify to the misery that can ensue when the only challenge you can overcome in your work is the challenge of coming to terms with the fact that you are not, in fact, presented with any challenges when the only way you can exercise your powers is in coming up with creative ways to cover up the fact that you cannot exercise your powers of managing the fact that you have, completely against your choosing, been turned into a parasite and a fraud.

When I am not busy with this, I might be checking the office email account (I have basically no training or administrative power, of course, so all I can do is forward these emails to my boss), moving packages from the door, where they get dropped off, to the package room, answering phone calls (again, I know nothing and rarely answer a question to the caller’s satisfaction), or finding ketchup packets from 2005 in the desk drawers.

Denying the Tories overall control in Trafford (by gaining four council seats) was exactly as party sources were predicting.

The parties held 2,308 and 1,230 seats respectively.The Liberal Democrats now control nine councils, up four, with 536 seats – a gain of 77. The Greens increased their share by eight seats to 39, while Ukip were the big losers, dropping 57 seats to hold just three. The far-right BNP were wiped out altogether.By early morning Labour had gained seats but failed to make the advances it had hoped for in London. The Conservatives lost seats but were relieved to cling on to key councils. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, said his party had a “reasonable night, a good night”. Jeremy Corbyn celebrated seizing Plymouth council and said he was delighted by the result. One pollster estimated that a general election matching these results would see Labour with a similar number of seats to the 262 it scored in 2017, while the Tories would lose 12.Surprise success for two Green candidates against Conservative incumbents helped Labour become the biggest party in the Manchester council, one of its biggest successes of the night. I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group on Trafford council. “This is far beyond our expectations.The party celebrated as it took control of Richmond by gaining 22 seats and had some other good results. Ed Davey, the party’s home affairs spokesman, said: It’s building a hugely important platform for future victories.” But elsewhere Vince Cable’s party showed no signs of enjoying the sort of recovery that would see it turn into a strong force at Westminster.Ukip\u0027s vote collapsed and by Friday morning it held just two seats, 44 down on four years ago. General secretary Paul Oakley tried to put a brave face on things by comparing the party to the Black Death. It\u0027s not all over at all, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that\u0027s exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn\u0027t finished because Brexit is being betrayed. Dan Sabbagh and Andrew SparrowThe prime minister toured areas where the Conservatives made gains – or seen off Labour’s advance. Greeted by cheering supporters in Wandsworth, she said: “Labour thought they could take control. This was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed.“We won’t take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.”May later travelled to Dudley, another Labour target held by the Tories, who were boosted by the collapse of support for Ukip. “We’ve seen great results around the country, not just here in the West Midlands, but in London. We’ve taken Basildon and Peterborough and we’ve shown what hard work by Conservative councillors can do in delivering for people,” she said.Justine Greening, the former education secretary, said the results revealed that Labour had reached “peak Corbyn” since last summer’s general election.In spite of May’s claim that she wanted to “bring our country back together”, the results underlined sharp isions between England’s towns and cities and between leave and remain-voting areas.Prof John Curtice, the elections expert, pointed out that the Conservative party appeared to have made gains predominantly in leave areas, as it profited from the collapse of Ukip. “The electorate that it now has is disproportionately a leave electorate,” he said.The Lib Dems also benefited from a Brexit backlash, with huge wins in two south-west London councils, Kingston and Richmond, both areas with a heavily pro-remain vote. The party picked up dozens of council seats elsewhere, from Hull to South Cambridgeshire, where they took control of the council. Sir Vince Cable, the party leader, said the results showed “a return to three-party politics.”Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan, warned that losing ground in Bolton, Dudley and her own seat of Wigan underlined the fact that Labour’s message was failing to appeal to voters in towns where years of job losses had eroded the sense of community.“People have looked to politics for some time to solve this and seen us obsessed with a city-centric model, which is reliant on the benefits trickling down,” she said. “Unless Labour gets to grips with that, the next election is far from secure, with Labour piling up the votes in cities, and the Tories having a near-monopoly on the countryside. Whoever gets this town’s argument will win the next general election and the one after that.”In London, Labour performed more strongly in boroughs where it already had a healthy lead over the Conservatives when the seats were last contested, in 2014.Judged by the numbers of seats, Labour put in its best performance ever in a series of outer London boroughs, including Ealing, Croydon, Enfield and Waltham Forest.But the biggest blow for the party came in Barnet, its main target in the capital, where it needed to gain just one seat to take control. Instead, the north London council moved into overall Conservative control, amid Labour recriminations about antisemitism.Andy Burnham, Manchester’s metropolitan mayor, said voters had raised the issue of antisemitism with him on the doorstep.“It is clear that antisemitism was a very real issue in this campaign, not everywhere, but in areas where particularly there is a large Jewish community,” he said. “That is true here in Greater Manchester. If you look at the Kersal ward in Salford, I was out there myself and it was a pretty sobering experience, to be honest, because the hurt and the anger is painfully real in those places.“So what I would say back to Ken Livingstone and others who have made this argument that it’s all a smear designed to just undermine Jeremy Corbyn, let’s hope that these elections draw a very firm line under these arguments and basically knock it out, because the truth of the matter is there is a very real sense of rawness in the Jewish community.”Grassroots campaign group Momentum said its thousands of activists had helped to boost Labour’s showing in a series of key areas, including Trafford, where the Conservatives lost control, and Wandsworth.“We’re very pleased to see healthy gains in areas where Momentum campaigned hardest,” said Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator. “This shows just how important it is to have an engaged, enthusiastic movement - people who will get out into the community and spread Labour’s message.”While early predictions that Labour could take Wandsworth proved over-optimistic, Labour sources pointed out that a few hundred votes in several swing wards could have clinched it. Corbyn said his party had come “within a whisker” of winning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eaee1a6eef9a5af752dc07cd95f78aab40fbb0/261_174_3135_1881/master/3135.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d383bb10c2d78d64b0e11e9d8374b0b","title":"local elections council england 2018 tories labour corbyn may","story":"Electoral Reform Society releases figure as local elections in England bring mixed results for main partiesLabour has gained control of Tower Hamlets council, over which no party previously had overall control, the Press Association reports. The party has won 23 of the 45 available seats, though some wards are still to declare.With that, we’re going to close this live blog. Thanks for reading.According to the Press Association, 149 of the 150 councils have now declared, with only Tower Hamlets’ results to come. Here’s how the main parties stand:The former cabinet minister, Justine Greening, has hit out at her party colleagues in the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG), accusing them of behaving a “little bit like Russia ... vetoing things that they don’t like” during the Brexit deliberations.The rightwing group, led by the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, must understand that “no one is going to quite get their perfect outcome”, the former education secretary told Sky News.The sooner they all realise that and then work through the give and take and find a sustainable long-term solution on Brexit, the sooner we’ll be able to get on with the implementation planning around that which is urgent, and the sooner we’ll be able to get on with running the country and get on with the domestic agenda - for me the equality of opportunity - and the issues that are really at the heart of what I think people want tackled.Asked if the ERG was being given too much attention, Greening said:Well look, I think what we can’t have is a group of MPs who behave a little bit like Russia does on the Security Council - vetoing things that they don’t like.We have got to go forward on Brexit as a country together. That will mean give and take and people need to understand that, whatever wing of my party they are on, and whatever elements of the LeaveRemain debate they are on. I’m afraid no one is going to quite get their perfect outcome.She also told the broadcaster she was concerned the Brexit war cabinet would find itself out of step with the Tory party when it discusses what sort of customs arrangement it wants with the European Union post-Brexit.I think it’s time for the moderates in the party like myself to work with the prime minister on a sensible approach to the customs policy and a broader package and then make sure this is something we can get through Parliament.Here’s an update on the 146 councils out of 150 that have declared so far:There is no overall control in 21 councils (-1)Labour retains Hounslow, winning 33 of the available 60 seats. The Conservatives have won six seats so far, with 21 still to declare.Here are some analysis articles about the local elections that are worth reading.The pendulum is stuck. The traditional laws of political gravity predict a swing away from the party of national government in local elections, but it has been a while since British politics followed the obvious arc of precedent.If last night’s council election results conform to any pattern, it is the laudable habit that voters have acquired of giving party leaders cause to scratch their heads and wonder what the hell is going on. There is no big national winner. Since the Tories were braced for a mauling and escaped without one, Theresa May will be feeling relatively relaxed today. Labour needed to demonstrate that last year’s general election gains were a staging post on the road to national power that destiny was calling Jeremy Corbyn. Destiny didn’t hang up the phone, but it has put the opposition on hold. Labour had ambitious targets – Tory bastions in London such as Westminster and Wandsworth – that did not fall.One pro-remain Conservative told me last night’s results were “a bit of a disaster for our side.” He said they would encourage Tories to see Brexit supporters as their core demographic and prioritise pleasing them. At the same time, he worried, Labour would now feel it has to go hunting lost Brexit support to make up vital electoral ground outside London.The more hardline amongst the Brexit-supporting Tory MPs might be emboldened by the overnight results in some pro-leave areas of England. Those who have been waving around letters to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, calling for a vote of no confidence in Theresa May, could in the tense weeks and months ahead feel that throwing the pieces in the air and seeing where they land, even if it heightens the risk of a general election, is not such a risk as some have suggested and preferable to what they see as a heavily diluted Brexit.The Conservatives have so far made 163 seat gains and suffered 165 losses. As a result they will likely end the day with a similar overall tally as the one they started with. Most, 89, of the Conservative losses were in London, and most, 132, of their gains were outside London. This differential in the Tory performance is part of a broader pattern whereby the Conservatives won more votes and seats in places which were more supportive of Brexit. As a result, the councils the party has won (Basildon, Peterborough, Redditch) are all places that voted to leave the EU at a rate of 61 per cent or more in 2016.The exception to this rule tells an important story linked to the row over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Of the wards across the country where the BBC collected the votes, Labour is up by just 3 points where more than 4 per cent of the population is Jewish, but the party is up by 7 points on average elsewhere. This correlation had a particular impact in both Barnet and Bury where the Jewish population is relatively large. That Labour not only failed to take its (notionally) easiest target in London, but the Conservatives actually managed to gain six seats and take control of Barnet (where 38 per cent voted Remain) is quite remarkable.I first advanced the theory that Labour’s electoral coalition might simply be becoming less likely to turn up in off-years under Ed Miliband as a possible explanation for why Labour were underperforming relative to the opinion polls. Of course, that wasn’t true in 2015, but it doesn’t mean it won’t turn out to be true in the future. Labour’s coalition has been getting younger, more likely to live in a city and more erse pretty steadily since 2001 and it took a big leap forward in that direction in 2017. My feeling is that at some point that is going to mean that the predictive value of local election performances at general elections is going to change and change big. We may have reached that point already, but then again it may not. Mr Corbyn has a proud history of leaving commentators with egg all over their faces. He can summon up charisma when he needs it and has an extraordinary ability to keep battling on regardless of circumstances. He also has some huge advantages on his side. A Tory party that is deeply ided over the most important issue facing the country an establishment that thinks that Brexit is a Tory-made disaster a generational ide that has left people under 40 struggling to get their feet on the property ladder and a widespread sense that the country’s infrastructure, from the NHS to the transport system, is on the verge of collapse. Even so, Corbynmania is now officially dead.That’s all from me for today.My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over.The Electoral Reform Society has warned of what it calls a “dark day for politics” after saying that almost 4,000 would-be voters were turned away from polling stations for not having the necessary ID in the five boroughs which tested out voter ID schemes on Thursday.The scheme, which could be extended nationwide in future elections, saw varying ID requirements in Bromley, Woking, Gosport, Watford and Swindon.Critics had warned the trail was targeting a tiny problem of voter impersonation at polling booths, and risked putting off more vulnerable voters who might not hold the necessary documents, for example older people and the homeless.Britain prides itself on being a leading democracy – but it is a dark day for politics when thousands of blameless people turn out to vote only to be refused.Our estimates, based on evidence gathered by electoral observers, reveal the shocking scale of the problem. These trials have been shown up to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted.According to the BBC, the Conservative party has reinstated a candidate who won a seat in Sunderland who had been suspended over offensive social media posts, including one about Diane Abbott from several years ago.Abbott has posted a message on Twitter suggesting this shows the Tories are not taking the problem seriously.Here are some results that have come in in the last hour or so.Cherwell C No change C 12, Lab 3, LD 1, Vacant 1 Boundary change Lab up 1, LD up 1, C down 1, Ind down 1 New council: C 36, Lab 9, Ind 1, LD 1, Vacant 1 Manchester Lab No change Boundary change LD up 1, Lab down 1 New council: Lab 94, LD 2 A former mayor whose reinstatement gave the Conservatives control of a council by one seat has “sincerely apologised” over a racial Facebook joke which saw her suspended from the party, the Press Association reports. Rosemary Carroll, who made a post comparing an Asian with a dog last June, rejoined “as the votes were being counted” on Friday, giving the Tories narrow control of Pendle council in Lancashire.The post was shared in error but Rosemary fully accepted the potential upset caused and sincerely apologised. Having served her suspension period she rejoined the party and completed additional ersity training.Carroll, a former mayor of Pendle who represents the Earby ward, previously said she meant to delete the post but accidentally published it in error. Leader of the Labour group, Mohammed Iqbal, said the situation was an “appalling state of affairs”. He said:Here’s a councillor who brought shame on the borough on an international level and was welcomed back into the fold with open arms simply to grab control to the council. She turned up with a Conservative rosette literally as the votes were being counted.Dan Jarvis used his victory after being elected as Sheffield city region’s mayor to call for a wider devolution deal for Yorkshire. The post has only just been established, and the job does not yet come with agreed powers, an agreed budget, or even an agreed salary. He said:I say this because I believe that the issue of devolution goes to the heart of two of the most important strategic issues that our country faces - how we respond to the causes of Brexit and how we prepare for a post-Brexit Britain. If we are to find the right answer to these questions we must be prepared to reform every aspect of our political system.Labour has retained control of Birmingham council, the Press Association reports. It has got 51 of the 101 seats, with 14 two-councillor wards yet to declare.Birmingham, which is the largest council in Britain, is one of the areas that has had all-out council elections (with all seats being up for grabs, not just the usual one third) following boundary changes.These are from the BBC’s Kathryn Stanczyszyn.Lord Heseltine, the Conservative former deputy prime minister, has told Sky News that he thinks the election results amount to a “stalemate”. He says he thinks Labour under Jeremy Corbyn has hit a “glass ceiling”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd0dec418a064a6eddb938df2627d59b0564476/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec1a968883e1de9501bcaf012d5b3f5","title":"local council election results 2018 in full","story":"Seats on 150 councils are up for grabs in this year’s local elections, the first major test of public opinion since last year\u0027s snap general election.

Later, he was driven around London for part of the night by the taxi driver who brought him to the address after his release from detention. He was placed in a hostel as a temporary measure.The disabled man was initially supposed to be released from detention six weeks ago but the Home Office continued to detain him as they were unable to identify suitable, wheelchair-accessible accommodation.The criticism from circuit judge Karen Jane Walden-Smith, sitting as a high court judge, is likely to be the first judicial rebuke received byJavid, who only became home secretary on Monday following Amber Rudd’s resignation.The Official Solicitor is involved with the case because the man lacks mental capacity. The disabled man is Jamaican and has been in the UK for 17 years. He was granted leave to remain before serving two years and three months in prison. The nature of his convictions were not disclosed in court.Following his release, the Home Office opened deportation proceedings against the man. A psychiatric assessment found that he lacked mental capacity and had PTSD and a mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.He had been held in detention since last July, although the Home Office accepted that he was an “adult at risk”. Following a judicial review launched by the man’s solicitors, the Home Office authorised his release from detention on 21March.However, he was not physically released from detention until the evening of 2 May, the day before a court hearing in the case. On arrival at his allocated accommodation that night, he discovered steps leading to the front door, which was not opened by the occupants.Shortly before 10pm the man called his solicitor using the taxi driver’s phone, who advised that he should be returned to detention so that alternative accommodation could be arranged. The taxi driver said he had no authorisation to do this. The disabled man complained of back pain as a result of the journey and waiting around, and requested an ambulance be called. He also became agitated and threatened to break the taxi’s windows.The judge criticised the “lack of clarity about what was happening”. She said that alternative accommodation was found but the man said it was not wheelchair-accessible, so he was taken to a hostel in south London for newly arrived asylum seekers, where he remains. The Home Office has not yet found suitable permanent alternative accommodation that has sufficient disabled access.She ruled that the new accommodation must be wheelchair-accessible and give the man easy access to a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. She said if the Home Office failed to comply, the man could bring the matter back to court.“The secretary of state has acted very much last minute, at the last hour,” she said.The Home Office has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93bead28cf1854b92d59852869af68e60b6a34c3/0_0_3480_2089/master/3480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87362dbbb836bf9eafd783b9a0d290ae","title":"john higgins barry hawkins leads world championship snooker crucible","story":"• Higgins holds 13-11 lead over Kyren Wilson in race to 17• Hawkins fights back against resurgent Mark Williams to lead 9-7John Higgins maintained his two-frame World Championship semi-final advantage over Kyren Wilson after an intriguing evening session at the Crucible. Higgins opened up a 12-9 lead but Wilson responded with breaks of 106 and then 93 to get to within a frame of the Scot.But Higgins rallied and a run of 91 saw him take a 13-11 lead into Saturday, where he needs only four frames to advance to the final.Wilson trailed 9-7 going into the session and made an immediate statement with a break of 124 to halve the deficit. Breaks of 56 and 75, though, gave Higgins a three-frame cushion before Wilson again rallied with a run of 81 to take the fourth frame of the session. Higgins responded again to stretch his lead but Wilson’s 50th century break of the season and then that 93 moved him within one again. Higgins kept his cool to win the final frame of the evening.Barry Hawkins showed the kind of defiance that could land him the title on Monday as he wrested back control against Mark Williams in the other semi-final. The two-time former winner Williams produced some sparkling snooker before the mid-session interval to reel in Hawkins from 5-3 and draw level at six frames each and it seemed all the momentum was with the veteran Welshman.But Hawkins returned from his dressing room rejuvenated and once more took a grip, moving 9-7 clear overnight in the best-of-33 clash of the two left-handers.With Hawkins twitching and frowning from his seat, Williams scythed into his opponent’s overnight lead at first. A smooth opening 80 break set the early tone and, after they shared the next two frames, Williams struck again. Both men were briefly distracted – Hawkins by an official’s walkie-talkie blurting out a message as he played and missed a red, and Williams by untimely encouragement from a spectator before he failed to sink a brown.After giving Hawkins a playful nudge when their paths crossed, seemingly in a nod to the barge controversy involving Ronnie O’Sullivan and Ali Carter last Saturday, Williams produced a stunning pot on a crucial red. In trouble by the baulk cushion, Williams had to apply heavy swerve on the white to sink a ball 12 feet away and in effect it won him the frame.The interval was no help to the Welshman, though. The early fluency was gone and, when Hawkins doubled in the pink to make it three frames in a row it was a brutal blow. Williams hit back with a precious 62 to ensure he would still be in the running on Saturday, when they play to a finish over morning and evening sessions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762890bf53944b4f0602fdac2b6e83372a53d679/0_45_3460_2077/master/3460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a627d3d7353bdf39a3e348373a91e747","title":"tony bellew cause havoc david haye rematch","story":"• Bellew promises to ‘smash’ Haye in fierce pre-fight tirade• Boxers return to ring 14 months after Bellew won first boutThe conversation with Tony Bellew was idling towards an emotional conclusion as he reflected on what mattered to him in life: family, home, friends, Everton Football Club. And then the fighter detailed in a chilling blast of invective what he was going to do to David Haye at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday night.It was a tirade only a fighter could properly defend, or understand – and it sounded so much like Haye in his pomp.Moments earlier, Bellew had spoken with quiet sorrow about the death of his brother-in-law, Ashley, who fell to his death from a balcony on a family holiday in Cancun last August.“What my family’s been through I can’t even put into words. We’re very close. It’s really, really hard. It’s in my thoughts, when I’m sitting here. I think about Ashley’s mum and dad. I really do.”He spoke, too, about how his 12-year-old son was being ragged at school before the first fight, taunted that his father was going to be knocked out.“Our Corey likes to think he can have a fight, the fact is he couldn’t fight sleep. He’s a lovely looking boy. Looks just like his mother, a handsome kid. I wouldn’t be fighting if I had his looks when I was a kid.”Friday’s weigh-in passed without incident, although they managed a few ritual verbals. Away from the microphone, Haye whispered to Bellew: “I’m going to take my time with you. I’m going to chop you down. It’s going to be slow and painful. I’m going to make sure you suffer.”Haye looked his body-beautiful self at 15st 10lb, a stone lighter than 14 months ago. Bellew weighed just over 15st, three pounds lighter than in March 2017.The numbers that will count will be heavy blows landed, and Haye reckons his new Cuban coach, Ismael Salas, has fixed a long-standing fault in his footwork that will enable him to get more leverage on his already awesome punches. “I fought like a lunatic in the first fight. All the shots I was missing are going to be landing. Ismael has rewired my legs,” Haye said. “In the first fight – and even in the two previous fights – my legs weren’t connected. He’s noticed that. This is the best I’ve felt in 10 years. A lot of operations, a lot of punches in that time. But it feels right – and it will feel very wrong for Tony.”While Bellew has raged this time, Haye has gone for an almost super-soft approach. He has praised his conqueror repeatedly, only to be rebuffed. Bellew, a master of intransigence, picks at his ego, agreeing with nothing, arguing over nothing too.“In all honesty he’s a proper gobshite,” Bellew says. “I think he’s a tit. He’s got a mask on. He’s doing really well hiding his feelings and emotions. Why is he having to answer to me, a little fat Scouser? It shows how far back he’s gone. It infuriates him that I’ve got any kind of demands at all over him.“He knows he can’t say all the things he said last time because the media won’t absorb it. I’m not here for the media. I’m not here for the public. I’m here because this is my job. I just tell the truth. Some people don’t like it. Some people do. I’m just telling you exactly how I feel.”Bellew is scornful too that Haye is still fighting six years after he said he would be out of the business at 31.“Why can’t he just be honest and say: ‘Listen, I’ve earned £20m, I’ve pissed it up the wall, I’ve gone through a few things and I need to get more money.’ Just be humble and say it. I wouldn’t be fighting. My legacy is secure. I don’t give a shit if everyone remembers me or not. That’s what these fights are about. Money. Don’t get me wrong: I want to win, and I’ll do whatever it takes. But I know what I’m saying: he’s back for money.”Haye’s response was quick and quiet. “People have been saying that for years.” For the only time in his career, Haye has been out-talked this week. As Salas says: “Actions speak louder than words.” And there will be more of the former on Saturday night, with the latter reserved to announce the winner. I expect that to be Haye, pushed near to the limit over 12 rounds, and maybe persuaded that, finally, he has survived long enough in this business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23cb66c45ad44338a82117a5facbf49d0cd6ee0/17_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6250bd4cc14064151f08a530400f6a3","title":"victoria pendleton abandons everest climb on health grounds","story":"Former Olympic cyclist advised to cut short expedition due to effects of oxygen deprivationThe Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton has abandoned an attempt to climb Mount Everest after suffering from the effects of oxygen deprivation.The cyclist-turned-jockey had set out for the summit with the TV presenter Ben Fogle and had reached the mountain’s second camp, 21,000ft (6,400 metres) above sea level, after spending weeks preparing for the final climb.But Pendleton, 37, started suffering the effects of hypoxia and was advised by her doctor to end her climb. Fogle is understood to be continuing the expedition.“Unfortunately after much deliberation I have decided not to continue my endeavour to summit Mount Everest,” the Olympian wrote on Instagram.“The weather conditions have offered the possibility of an early summit bid, as a consequence I have been unable to adhere to the prescribed rotation program and keep pace with the team without causing concern regarding my health at the higher camps, due to my lack of adaptation to the extreme altitude.”Pendleton said she was “incredibly disappointed” not to complete the challenge, “as I feel in great physical condition and was moving swiftly and efficiently through the icefall and across the glacier”.She added: “Whilst we were working and moving I was really positive and comfortable. Unfortunately when we were recovering in camp in the afternoon, relaxing with a resting heart rate with a less active breathing pattern, I started to feel quite unwell and felt my body was going into shut down and the oxygen saturation of my blood was very low. So much so that I required a light flow of oxygen that continued throughout the night.Mountaineers are advised to carry oxygen bottles on high-altitude climbs to prevent hypoxia, which can be fatal.Pendleton is one of Britain’s most successful female Olympians, having won a silver medal and two golds. She retired from cycling in 2012 and is now is now an amateur jockey. She told reporters in December she was taking part in the challenge because she was “probably having a midlife crisis”.She and Fogle, accompanied by Kenton Cool, reached base camp on 21 April after training in Nepal, the Andes and the Alps.Before the trip, Pendleton said her husband, Scott Gardner, the former Team GB sports scientist, would have preferred her not to climb the summit. “In an ideal world, he would like to be able to stop me, but he knows that won’t make me happy,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb3c0420c93747a0b90b0d1435c211d8da44bc55/0_100_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=088a7f38f673f0a6f8555741da592657","title":"rachael young interview nighclubbing grace jones afrofuturism","story":"This year, Black Panther put afrofuturism in multiplexes – and there are plenty more artists of colour exploring inner and outer space, like artist and playwright Rachael YoungMore than ever before, black people are telling their own stories on British stages. Plays such as Nine Night at the National – in which a Caribbean family prepares to bury their recently deceased matriarch – have gained rave reviews. Everyday depictions of black life are now celebrated. But what about extraordinary black stories?For Rachael Young, whose show Nightclubbing comes to Camden People’s theatre next week before heading off on a tour of the UK, incorporating the extraordinary into the everyday became possible with the help of one thing: afrofuturism. A term coined in 1993 by cultural critic Mark Dery, today afrofuturism is defined as “a movement in literature, music, art etc, featuring futuristic or science fiction themes which incorporate elements of black history and culture”.Keisha Thompson, whose show Man on the Moon used afrofuturism to explore themes of family and mental health, expands on the concept. “At its core, afrofuturism uses the black experience to create work that is otherworldly, cosmic and surreal. For me, it’s about creative freedom. Using political pain and channelling it. Taking the experience of being ‘othered’ and subverting it into something otherworldly. It’s about using the knowledge of our ancestors to battle the erasure that we experience on a daily basis.”In Nightclubbing, Young (alongside musicians Mwen Rukandema and Leisha Thomas) bounces between telling two stories. One is the life of Grace Jones, whose groundbreaking 1981 album gives the show its title. The other is the imagined biography of the four black women who were turned away from the London nightclub Dstrkt in 2015. The incident gained widespread media attention and kickstarted a conversation about the racist door policies of many London venues. Rapper Stormzy even dissed the club on First Things First, the opening track on his debut album. For Young, the afrofuturist themes she works with today stemmed from thinking about these women, their lives and what they could represent. “The show came from the club incident,” she says. “Knowing what it’s like to be a black person from Nottingham – where you’re basically invisible – it hit me because I was like: what is this nonsense? Then I started thinking about these women being dark-skinned. I was wondering about which women get to transcend these things, and I got to a place where I found Grace Jones. Growing up, Jones was always this person that was always breaking away from the norm and doing her own thing, and she has always managed to be authentic. She’s dark-skinned, androgynous, and as she’s always been ahead of her time, she can be – is – afrofuturist.”Afrofuturism has hit the mainstream more squarely than ever before. Science fiction writers such as Octavia Butler have gained newfound popularity as literary feminists strive to be more intersectional, while in music, artists such as Flying Lotus, Solange, The Comet Is Coming, Thundercat, Erykah Badu, Sun Ra and Janelle Monáe are all part of the movement. Then there’s Marvel’s smash-hit superhero movie Black Panther, which imagines an African country untouched by colonialism, and thriving, away from the world stage. Young calls the film “revolutionary. I saw these strong female characters, dark-skinned black women, as warriors and inventors, things that we don’t ever see.” For poet and performer Vanessa Kisuule, who is currently working on a play with “elements of afrofuturism in it”, the appeal the genre has for black artists is obvious. “Afrofuturism frees our mind from the shackles of what a black artist ‘should’ speak on,” she says. “It is constantly assumed that black artists can only offer narratives that are ‘gritty’, urban and from our direct experience. I suppose the assumption is that we are so bogged down in our perpetual states of suffering that we haven’t the scope to think of much else. It is precisely because of this sociopolitical framework that black artists can have the capacity to dream up alternate worlds where we can, momentarily, transcend our current reality.”For Young, using afrofuturism has been a way to allow her imagination to create a new normal. “I was asked the question recently: does your work try to rewrite history? No, it can’t. What is important is how you galvanise the energy from history to move forward with what you imagine that future to be like. And that’s why afrofuturism feels like such a simple but hopeful thing. To be able to read about all these inventors, to see black people in sci-fi, to dream. It’s this that gives me the impulse to say: OK, things can get better? It’s a long way off, but maybe we’re starting to take steps towards that happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3432bbca881c7efea8106aff6aad5936a15b6d/257_349_4138_2481/master/4138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59efc6977740193d3e8548ed80bb75f8","title":"sandra gimlets siri drama starring alia shawkat podcasts of the week","story":"Cariad Lloyd’s podcast about bereavement continues to impress, while Shawkat and Kirsten Wiig’s new venture is a high-quality thrillerIn a recent episode of her death-themed podcast, comedian Cariad Lloyd spoke about how awful her late father had been at talking about death, and the irony of her own capacity for the subject.

British GDP has fallen steadily from $3tn in 2014, according to World Bank figures.The release of Friday’s data demonstrated the sheer immensity of California’s economy, home to a thriving technology sector in Silicon Valley, the world’s entertainment capital in Hollywood and America’s “salad bowl” in its agricultural heartland. It also reflects a substantial turnaround since the recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008.California’s economic output is now surpassed only by the total GDP of the United States, China, Japan and Germany.All economic sectors except agriculture contributed to California’s higher GDP, said Irena Asmundson, chief economist at the California department of finance. Financial services and real estate led the way, with $26bn in growth, followed by the information sector, which includes many technology companies, at $20bn.

Lava spurted into the sky from the road and aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest. On Friday afternoon, a 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit the island followed by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake about an hour later, officials reported.A resident, Ikaika Marzo, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that lava spread over an area about 180 metres wide behind one house in Leilani Estates on Thursday. He said it sounded like a jet engine.Residents had been warned for the last week that they should prepare to evacuate, with officials saying an eruption would give little warning. Nearby community centres were providing shelter.Earlier in the week, a school in the Puna district was closed due to the continuing seismic activity and several roads cracked under the strain.Since Monday, hundreds of earthquakes – most of them about 2.0 magnitude – have been recorded in the area. The Puu Oo, which is a volcanic cone in the eastern rift zone of the Kīlauea volcano, began to collapse on Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into newly created underground chambers.Officials said it was impossible to predict how long the eruption would last. The volcano had burned two homes, authorities said. Jeremiah Osuna, who captured drone footage of the lava stream, told the Honolulu television station KOHN that it sounded as if someone “put a bunch of rocks into a dryer”. He said he could smell the sulphur, along with the burning trees and other vegetation.The US Geological Survey said fresh cracks in the ground were reported on Thursday afternoon and hot vapour and lava began to erupt.The geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed below Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night. The Hawaii county civil defence agency closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.After the second major earthquake, there were no immediate reports of significant damage, and the Hilo airport and highways did not face major impacts, according to the Associated Press. There were also no reports of damage. The earthquake wasn’t strong enough to cause a tsunami, and no tsunami threat or advisory has been put in place, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It is located in the Hawaii Volcanoes national park, which has closed off nearly 6,350 hectares (15,700 acres) due to “the possibility of a new eruption and unstable geologic activity”.Most of Kilauea’s activity has been non-explosive, but an eruption in 1924 spewed ash and nine tonnes of rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo’s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 460 metres (1,500ft) high.

The free tickets, worth up to £400 each, will be offered to any EU citizens who turn 18 before July as part of a pilot DiscoverEU scheme funded by the EU. With Brexit on the horizon this is the first and last year British teenagers can apply for the rail bonanza, which has just been launched in Brussels.“Any future participating depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” said Nathalie Vandystadt, the EU commission spokesperson for education, culture, youth and sport.The scheme has been masterminded by the German MEP and leader of the European People’s party in the European parliament, Manfred Weber. His long-term vision is to give a free Interrail pass to each child in an EU country when they turn 18 as part of a way of promoting cultural and social ties among EU citizens. “I am convinced that the ‘18th birthday’ Interrail pass for Europe could become a true flagship project for the development of a common European identity in ersity,” he said. Interrail was launched in 1972 with £27.50 tickets offering unlimited travel across Europe as part of a scheme by rail operators to tempt young Europeans to explore their home continent.The European commission and the European parliament hope to give those with the least chance of travel the opportunity for what they believe will be a formative experience of their lives.“Emotions and links between people is something that is also worth investing in. This is what the DiscoverEU project is about. The point of the initiative is to give young Europeans, including those who are not students, the opportunity to travel, discover the beauty and richness of our continent and meet with other young Europeans from all over Europe. I believe it can contribute to create a feeling of common amongst Europeans,” Weber said.The EU has earmarked €12m (£10.6m) for the for the pilot scheme this year with a further €700m pencilled in for the next seven years in the proposed EU €1.25tn budget for 2021-2027.The first application round for 15,000 tickets will take place between 12 June and 26 June. If successful another 15,000 passes will be released in the second half of the year. About 1,900 tickets have been earmarked for British applicants, with 2,500 for Germany, 1,960 for France and 140 for Ireland. Sources say these allocations may change depending on take up from each member state. Participants will be able to travel up to 30 days to up to four EU countries with rail and ferries included. Their trip should be connected to a place with a specific value in terms of European cultural heritage, European sites, places of historic interest, specific social or cultural values and traditions. Applicants will have to give reasons for why they should be awarded the Interrail pass and agree to act as European ambassadors by posting about their experiences on social media.

Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergIrish Government expectations of a shift in the British position towards the customs union have been dashed in recent days, with senior figures in Dublin becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for a breakthrough in the talks before the June EU summit.Without movement in the British position the Government has been clear that it will block progress on further negotiations on an overall EU-UK trade deal and an agreement on a transition period.Officials are adamant that the EU strongly backs this position, raising the prospect of a collapse in the Brexit talks at or before the June summit.Several senior Irish sources have confirmed to The  during the past week that Downing Street had sent strong signals through back channels of an impending move in the British position, with sources mentioning cabinet office minister David Lidington and chancellor Philip Hammond as among those who had privately indicated to Dublin that a significant softening of the British position was imminent.However, the British also signalled growing problems with the “backstop” commitment, and hoped that a significant move on the customs union would lead to a easing of pressure from Dublin to enshrine the backstop into the withdrawal treaty.Under the backstop arrangement, which the British prime minister Theresa May gave in December and reiterated at the most recent EU summit in March, the British promised that in event there was no agreement between the EU and UK, it would ensure no ergence between customs and trade rules in the North and South.This has been interpreted by the EU as meaning that the North would remain in the customs union after Brexit – enraging some Conservatives and Northern Unionists.It is understood that the European Commission had also been informed of a likely shift in the British position and had signalled its approval.However, at a crucial cabinet sub-committee meeting in Downing Street on Wednesday Mrs May failed to garner support for her plan for a “customs partnership” with the EU, with Brexiteer ministers uniting to scupper the plan.According to high-level sources, Mrs May’s “customs partnership” plan did not meet the expectations in Dublin or Brussels, and instead resembled previous British suggestions that have been rejected by the EU side. In any event, Ms May could not generate sufficient support for the plan. Irish expectations that she was prepared to face down Brexiteer members of her cabinet – losing some if necessary – were left unfulfilled.There is now a high degree of pessimism in Dublin about the immediate future of the talks. Both the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney have said they will insist on significant progress on the inclusion of the backstop agreement in the legal text of the withdrawal treaty by the June summit or the trade talks cannot proceed.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

fundamentally unfair on parents who do pay.He said a child would always receive a meal and although he previously told parents it was bread, fruit and water, he accepted that statement lacked detail

selling 7 ebay picture jesse james 2m christies","story":"Justin Whiting with his Jesse James photo When Justin Whiting discovered a photograph of Jesse James on eBay he thought he stood to make the kind of booty the legendary Wild West outlaw would have been proud of.After buying the rare photograph of the 19th century bank robber for just £7 in July last year, two American experts told him it was genuine, making it worth as much as £2 million.But Mr Whiting’s dreams of riding off into the sunset, his saddle bags full of gold, have now been shattered.Christie’s auctioneers have refused to accept the 3.5 inches by 2.5 inches Victorian tintype photograph for sale, after concluding the man pictured was not in fact Jesse James at all.It told Mr Whiting: “This photograph would not be suitable for a forthcoming auction with Christie’s.”Justin Whiting\u0026#39 photo Jesse James (right) and an existing picture of the outlaw at a similar ageThe move came after a surviving descendant of James commissioned British expert Mark Bampton who, after closely examining the photograph, found there were too many facial differences for the person it it to be the outlaw.Mr Bampton compared an existing picture of James at a similar age to the man in the new photograph, using linear analysis of the two images to establish any differences in facial features.He found that, crucially, the young man in Mr Whiting’s photograph had a much thicker bottom lip than that of James, as well as a “much shorter neck”.Mr Brampton also compared Mr Whiting’s photograph with another accepted one of James, and found marked differences between the position of the two men’s ears and eyes.He concluded: “It is clear from my analysis that there are significant differences proving that Justin Whiting’s

accuser nick scotland yard","story":"Harvey is suing the Met and Nick Harvey Proctor, the former Tory MP, who was falsely accused of child rape and murder by a fantasist called Nick, is suing him and Scotland Yard for £1 million.The 71-year-old, who lost his home and his job, as a result of the malicious allegations, has launched a claim for damages in the High Court.His legal action could see Nick - whose real identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons - have to give evidence in open court for the first time about the extraordinary false claims that traduced the reputations of a string of high profile figures.Mr Proctor - who represented the constituency of Basildon between 1979 and 1983 and Billericay between 1983 and 1987 - was one of a number of well known men accused of being part of a VIP paedophile ring operating at the heart of Westminster.He was questioned by police over the alleged killing two young boys and assisting in the murder of a third.Harvey Proctor is seeking £1 million in damagesMr Proctor\u0027s home in the grounds of Belvoir Castle  - where he worked as a private secretary to the Duke of Rutland - was raided by police and as a result he was forced to leave job and home.He is seeking £1 million for loss of income as well as personal injury and damage to his reputation.In documents lodged at the High Court last night he launched action against Nick and Cressida Dick, the current Commissioner of the politan Police, claiming their actions were malicious.The papers were lodged with High CourtHe claims the ordeal has caused him to suffer a major depressive illness for more than two years.Mr Proctor has revealed that he doubts he will ever be able to reconstruct his life and has been left feeling suicidal on numerous occasions.Describing how the ordeal had left him feeling, he said: “I’ve got no money ...no savings, I’ve got no job...my life is in limbo. I’d be surprised if on the day that I die, I don’t think about this and I know it’ll be in my obituaries and that’s very hurtful.”Lord Hogan-Howe, who was head of Scotland Yard throughout Operation Midland could also be forced to appear in any civil trial.Lord Hogan-Howe was Commissioner of the Met at the time of Operation MidlandOperation Midland was launched in 2014, when Nick went to police to claim he had been abused by a cabal of powerful public figures between 1975 and 1984.Among the other alleged abusers were the former Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath the former Home Secretary, Leon Brittan the former head of the army, Lord Bramall and the former Labour MP, Greville Janner.In launching an appeal for witnesses to come forward, one senior Scotland Yard detective referred to his complaints as credible and true.Scotland Yard spent over £2 million on Operation MidlandBut despite spending more than £2 million and having 31 full time officers working on the case for more than a year, Operation Midland was closed in March 2016 without a single arrest having been made.Nick was subsequently investigated over perverting the course of justice and fraud and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is expected to announce a decision on whether he will be charged later in summer.In September last year the politan Police paid £100,000 compensation to Lord Bramall and Lady Brittan for the raids carried out on their homes during the investigation.But a similar offer made to Mr Proctor was rejected because of his loss of livelihood and home.He said he had brought the legal action with a “heavy heart” but felt he had been left without any choice.Operation Midland: How it unfoldedHawaii rocked by strongest quake in 40 years as Kilauea volcano sparks fountains of lavaDaily aspirin dose \u0026#39doubles risk of skin cancer in men\u0026#39Let children run around in class, headteachers toldDonald Trump says time and place decided for Kim Jong-un summitBread and water fed to pupils who forgot lunch moneyHow will Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis fit into the Royal WeddingKennedy cousin, Michael Skakel, wins retrial of 2002 murder conviction Collector stopped from selling his £7 eBay picture of Jesse James for £2m after Christie\u0026#39s call in experts Fellaini fails in bid to sue New Balance over \u0026#39defective\u0026#39 football boots Wife hits out at bigamist husband who called her every day for 17 years following splitFormer SNP member campaigning over uncle\u0026#39s suicide says \u0026#39vile\u0026#39 Cybernat abuse left her sobbing Donald Trump says London hospital \u0026#39like a war zone for stabbing wounds\u0026#39 as he defends US gun laws Steakgate: a blow-by-blow account of the \u0026#39fracas\u0026#39 that got Jeremy Clarkson firedWhite House denies it is reducing US troops in South Korea Donald Trump says his lawyer \u0026#39needs to get his facts straight\u0026#39 following furore over porn star paymentChris Packham calls for end to abuse of Scottish Natural Heritage chief over raven cull after death threatHairdresser Daryll Rowe sentenced in Scotland for trying to infect more men with HIVUS ambassador promises to \u0026#39spread the word\u0026#39 about bravery of Scottish island as ship disasters rememberedUK\u0026#39s Washington ambassador slaps down French counterpart over British burning down the White House NHS breast cancer scandal: victims and families open upWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts strongest quake 40 years rocks","story":"A series of fresh earthquakes on Friday, including a powerful magnitude 6.9, hit Hawaii\u0027s Big Island, where the Kilauea volcano has been spewing fountains of lava into residential areas and forcing hundreds to evacuate.The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the strongest tremor at 12.32 pm measured 6.9, the island\u0027s largest earthquake in more than 40 years.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said the quake, whose epicentre was on the south flank of the volcano, was not large enough to cause a tsunami although it generated sea level changes around the island of up 40 cm.It caused buildings to shake at the Community Centre in Pahoa town, one of two evacuation centres in the area hastily set up after lava started burbling up through fissures in the ground in neighbourhoods nearby.A new fissure opened up just before the latest tremor on Friday in one of those neighbourhoods, Leilani Estates, about a dozen miles from the volcano, the Hawaii County Civil Defence Agency said, making a total of four found so far.A fissure on Leilani and Kaupili Streets in the Leilani Estates subision caused by an eruption of the Kilauea Volcano following a series of earthquakes, in HawaiiKilauea, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes and one of five on the island, has been in constant eruption for 35 years. Lava flows from the volcano have covered 48 square miles, according to the US Geological Survey. Scientists say it is nearly impossible to predict how long an eruption will last.On Thursday, Kilauea began spewing lava into residential areas after a series of earthquakes over the past week, the USGS reported. Starting around 11 am on Friday, the island experienced a flurry of earthquakes, culminating in the massive magnitude 6.9 tremor. Residents in Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subisions, home to about 1,700 people, were ordered to evacuate in the early hours of Friday after officials reported steam and lava erupting from fissures in the road, the Civil Defence agency said.A fissure on Leilani and Kaupili Streets in the Leilani Estates subision caused by an eruption of the Kilauea Volcano following a series of earthquakes, in HawaiiNo injuries or deaths were reported, but Hawaii Governor David Ige activated the Hawaii National Guard to provide emergency help.Keone Kalawe, 58, a native Hawaiian who was volunteering at an evacuation centre in Pahoa, shrugged off the latest quake as just part of life over here.His family was forced out of the village of Kapoho, about 6 miles from Pahoa, after an eruption in 1960, and he\u0027s witnessed other eruptions over the past three decades. So he has lived with lava, which is not dangerous, he says.I tell people,\u0027You just have to sidestep.\u0027A plume of ash rises from the Puu Oo vent on Hawaii\u0026#39s Kilaueaa volcano A 492-foot-long fissure ripped open a road and spewed lava for about two hours in Leilani Estates at about 5.30 pm, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory said.Dale Miller, 58, a resident of Leilani Estates, said police knocked on his door at 4 am and ordered an evacuation.There are lava tubes on our property, he said referring to the natural tunnels underground that drain lava during an eruption. The whole thing is Swiss cheese.Lava overflows from the crater rimIt felt like there was something under the house -– like a big snake was moving under the house, said Lee Begaye, 61, Miller\u0027s partner and housemate. Lee added this was the first time in eight years of living by the volcano that they\u0027d had to evacuate.One resident, Ikaika Marzo, told Hawaii News Now he saw fountains of lava as high as 125 feet.Lava, which can reach temperatures of about 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit (1,150 Celsius), spread less than about 33 feet from the fissure, the observatory said.Aerial footage showed a curtain of fire snaking through a forest on the island, said resident Jeremiah Osuna.You could just smell sulfur and burning trees and underbrush and stuff, he told Honolulu television station KHON.Hawaii\u0027s governor has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard.The Kilauea volcano is one of five that make up Hawaii\u0027s Big Island, with a lake of molten lava at its peak and an eastern rift erupting near-continuously since 1983.However explosions along its two active rifts are rare. Asta Miklius, a geophysicist from the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said there is no way to know exactly how long the eruption will continue.One of the parameters is going to be whether the summit magma reservoir starts to drain in response to this event, and that has not happened yet, Mr Miklius said.There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably... so we are watching that very, very closely.The Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse on Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) down the slope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The USGS had raised the volcano alert in the area from a watch to a warning, reporting that new ground cracks were discovered in the late afternoon.White, hot vapor and blue fume emanated from an area of cracking in the eastern part of the subision, the agency wrote.It emphasised that the early stages of fissure eruptions are dynamic, and additional vents and new lava outbreaks may occur.At this time it is not possible to say where new vents could happen, it said.The affected area is part of the Big Island\u0027s East Rift Zone, in which the Hawaii Volcano Observatory had identified magma movement and warned residents that seismic activities and eruptions could take place without notice.All areas bordering East Rift Zone at high risk for eruption, Hawaii County\u0027s mayor Harry Kim said on Twitter.US Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was mobilising resources, as well as monitoring for forest fires, power outages and water supply issues.Hawaii Island, or the Big Island, is the largest of the eight main islands that comprise the Pacific US state, an archipelago that includes hundreds of smaller volcanic islands.Wei, who moved to Hawaii from California - known for its high earthquake risk - said the eruption was almost a relief.People live here - the Hawaiians and local people have lived here forever, she said. You know what\u0027s going on we have warning systems. Everybody should be prepared.An ash plume rises above the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii\u0026#39s Big Island Most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been non-explosive, but a 1924 eruption belched ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo\u0027s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring more than 1,500 feet high.In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes. Please review our commenting policyDaily aspirin dose \u0026#39doubles risk of skin cancer in men\u0026#39Let children run around in class, headteachers toldDonald Trump says time and place decided for Kim Jong-un summitBread and water fed to pupils who forgot lunch moneyHow will Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis fit into the Royal WeddingKennedy cousin, Michael Skakel, wins retrial of 2002 murder conviction Collector stopped from selling his £7 eBay picture of Jesse James for £2m after Christie\u0026#39s call in experts Former Tory MP Harvey Proctor sues accuser and Scotland Yard for £1mFellaini fails in bid to sue New Balance over \u0026#39defective\u0026#39 football boots Wife hits out at bigamist husband who called her every day for 17 years following splitFormer SNP member campaigning over uncle\u0026#39s suicide says \u0026#39vile\u0026#39 Cybernat abuse left her sobbing Donald Trump says London hospital \u0026#39like a war zone for stabbing wounds\u0026#39 as he defends US gun laws Steakgate: a blow-by-blow account of the \u0026#39fracas\u0026#39 that got Jeremy Clarkson firedWhite House denies it is reducing US troops in South Korea Donald Trump says his lawyer \u0026#39needs to get his facts straight\u0026#39 following furore over porn star paymentChris Packham calls for end to abuse of Scottish Natural Heritage chief over raven cull after death threatHairdresser Daryll Rowe sentenced in Scotland for trying to infect more men with HIVUS ambassador promises to \u0026#39spread the word\u0026#39 about bravery of Scottish island as ship disasters rememberedUK\u0026#39s Washington ambassador slaps down French counterpart over British burning down the White House NHS breast cancer scandal: victims and families open upWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"direct line beast east insurance claims annual weather budget q1 results","story":"Direct Line said the Beast From the East has already cost it £50m in additional claims, and will take up its entire £55m annual weather budget once all claims are processed.Freezing temperatures and heavy snow caused damage and disruption across the UK that caused a sharp rise in claims during February and March, the insurance company said.Despite the £55m hit, chief executive Paul Geddes said the company would hit financial targets for the whole year.Direct Line\u0027s results explain why insurance premiums are so highInvestors appeared less sure, with Direct Line’s shares falling 3 per cent on Wednesday morning.Mr Geddes said: “The freezing weather earlier this year hit many drivers, households and businesses hard, and I am proud of the way our people helped our customers during this difficult period, demonstrating the value of our insurance cover and service.“We estimate the claims associated with the major freeze event will utilise the group\u0027s full annual weather budget.”Gross written premiums fell 5 per cent to £769.9m in the first quarter, as partnerships with Nationwide and Sainsbury\u0027s ended.

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration. We have to change this.”A former student of the philosopher Hegel, Marx developed the theory of historical materialism which he argued explained the development of human society and the development of social classes. His work argues that capitalism’s creation of a mass of workers who owned no property will be its downfall. He argued for the establishment of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” through which workers would become the dominant class.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

These trials have been shown up to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted.“These findings are exactly what many feared: that this draconian measure would result in blameless iniduals being disenfranchised. It is vital moving forward that these draconian trials are not a fait accompli for a national rollout.”The figures did not take into account whether voters came back with the correct ID having initially been turned away. It is also impossible to know how many people were put off from entering a polling station altogether because of the new ID requirements.Democracy Volunteers, the UK’s largest election observer group, collated the figures while carrying out extensive observations of the ID checks in 243 polling stations across the five areas the scheme was being piloted.John Ault, director of the organisation, told The Independent 10 voters had been turned away within a 45-minute period at one polling station in Swindon, and that the issue appeared to disproportionately affect ethnic minority voters.British voters furious at being denied right to cast ballot over ID“Obviously there were always going to be teething problems, but I also think quite clearly that if you – whether intentionally or otherwise – exclude 1.5 to 2 per cent of the population, that is a significant problem,” he said.“The process was quite well run. Staff were welcoming and generally helpful, they tried to assist people who didn’t realise they were required to bring ID.“But the problem is some people clearly weren’t able to produce it, and we don’t know how many people didn’t come because they didn’t have it in the first place.”Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, clamed it was “impossible” for the government to justify rolling out the scheme.“After completely ignoring a number of serious warning signs, the government decided to pilot discriminatory measures which denied people their right to vote,” she said.“We cannot allow the Conservative Party to undermine our democracy, which is why Labour is calling on the government to scrap its voter ID plans as a matter of urgency.”Campaigners had questioned the evidence on which the trials were based. Figures from the Electoral Commission show there were just 28 allegations of impersonation in 2017 out of nearly 45 million votes – or one case for every 1.6 million votes cast. Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.Senior officials in trial areas expressed their concerns about the trials, while the government was criticised by the UK Statistics Authority for pushing misleading figures to support the need for the pilots.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsA government spokesperson insisted the pilots had been a “success”.“Voter ID is an important step to ensuring the public can have greater confidence in our democratic system and the success of yesterday’s pilots proves that this is a reasonable and proportionate measure to take,” he said.“The overwhelming majority of people cast their vote without a problem. We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally. As well as this, the independent Electoral Commission will conduct a planned evaluation of the pilots.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

It must be removed now.”Lucy Jones, of Doctors of the World, which works closely with undocumented migrants, said: “We regularly see patients, often in urgent need of medical care, who are too afraid to go to NHS services fearing their information will be shared across government. The exemption makes this fear an absolute reality.”And Adrian Berry, chairman of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, highlighted how lawyers for migrants would no longer be able to obtain their files using “subject access requests”.“The impact the exemption will have on curtailing access to personal data therefore goes to the very heart of access to justice and the preservation of the rule of law,” he warned.Amnesty, the Refugee Council, the National Aids Trust, the National Education Union, Privacy International and the trade union Unison are among the other organisations which have signed the letter, sent to Sajid Javid, the new home secretary.The Independent revealed last October that the exemption in the data protection bill would remove data privacy rights for immigration investigations.May should let parliament decide what to do about the customs unionVince Cable: ‘Theresa May will fight the next election’Theresa May ‘vetoed plan for overseas doctors to fill NHS gaps’Tory rebels vow to force May to reveal ‘tainted money’ in tax havensNew home sec says May’s ‘hostile’ immigration rhetoric not BritishHowever, the controversy has grown in the wake of the Windrush scandal – prompting the crucial amendment, put down by Labour and the Lib Dems, to be debated on Wednesday.The prime minister was accused of being in denial about the issue, when she told MPs recently: “It will be possible for people to access the information that they need.”In reality, the bill clearly states the rights to personal data “do not apply” where that conflicts with “the maintenance of effective immigration control” or “the investigation” of suspected immigration offences.Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, told The Independent: “This is completely against the British traditions of justice and the rule of law. It is an odious proposal.“If Theresa May doesn’t change her mind on this, no one will be able to take seriously a word she has said since Windrush. This is the first test.”The Home Office made “a lot of mistakes”, Mr Davey said – sometimes trying to deport “completely the wrong person” – which were only thwarted by the right to open up files.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said the policy was a “continuation of the government’s hostile environment policy”, adding: “Given the government’s track record in this area there no guarantee that it would exercise any exemption properly or proportionately.“Labour will support measures to delete this exemption from the bill when it returns to the Commons next week.”The Home Office has insisted the right to request data “will be met in all cases except where to do so could undermine our immigration control”.A spokesperson said: “They will have the right to complain to the information commissioner if they disagree with any use of the immigration exemption and we would always want to assist those whose claims are in question.”However, lawyers have rejected that right to appeal, warning a person would probably have been deported before a ruling came through.After his appointment last week, Mr Javid dropped the use of the “hostile environment” phrase – favoured by the prime minister – but has yet to say he will change the policies behind it.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesChinese President Xi Jinping speaks at an event to mark  Karl Marx’s 200th birthday at the Great Hall of the People in BeijingPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

But the more things change, the more they stay the same\u0026nbspLebanon is a colourful place at the moment. Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally. As well as this, the independent Electoral Commission will conduct a planned evaluation of the pilots.Labour suffered a massive election flop in key battlegrounds it had targeted in London, failing to wrestle away the key boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster from the Conservatives, while the Tories also unexpectedly gained the majority of seats in Nuneaton and Warwickshire.It also failed to capture Barnet, with some supporters attributing that to the anti-semitism row currently engulfing the party."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Royal-Wedding-2018-prince-harry-meghan-marble-955340.jpg","title":"royal wedding 2018 prince harry ex girlfriend girlfriends meghan markle","story":"The Royal Wedding is around the corner, but what does Harry\u0027s dating past look like?A dashing royal prince may well be on the wishlist for many women - but for Meghan Markle her dreams may have come true as she is set to wed her charming royal beau Prince Harry in just over two weeks.The couple will tie the knot in front of thousands - or even millions - at St George\u0026rsquos Chapel in Windsor on May 19.Their wedding plans were made public last November, when in their first televised interview together Prince Harry revealed he popped the question while they were roasting chicken fro dinner at their home in Kensington Palace.Prince Harry may be smitten with his American fianc\u0026eacute, however it hasn\u0026rsquot been an easy road to finding the one.

for me the equality of opportunity - and the issues that are really at the heart of what I think people want tackled.The Prime Minister is reportedly pushing for a Brexit deal which will include some form of customs partnership with the European Union.Her preferred model is said to be a \u0026lsquohybrid\u0026rsquo system which would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of Brussels.Justine Greening quit after a Cabinet reshuffle in JanuaryThe Conservative MP is known for his upper-class mannerisms and traditionalist views                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10But the mooted idea has been labelled \u0026ldquounworkable by EU officials, and Jacob Rees-Mogg has branded the plan \u0026ldquocretinous.A crunch meeting of Mrs May\u0026rsquos Brexit \u0026lsquowar cabinet\u0026rsquo this week met to discuss the customs union issue, but ministers were still deadlocked after hours of talks.The PM put off making a decision and instead ordered officials to go away and come up with \u0026ldquorevised proposals."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-news-theresa-may-hard-brexit-uk-leave-eu-eu-bloc-local-election-2018-corbyn-conservatives-labour-955516.jpg","title":"brexit news theresa may local elections 2018 jeremy corbyn conservatives labour","story":"Theresa May set for hard Brexit with no compromise after local election 2018 Theresa May described Thursday\u0026rsquos local election results as a \u0026ldquostrong night for the Conservatives after her party made ground across the country.High ranking Tories said the Prime Minister had a stronger authority than ever to press ahead with a clean break from the bloc.Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: \u0026ldquoLeave voters have stayed with her and that\u0026rsquos really important but they also have a demand and that is why messing around with these complicated models for Brexit is wrong.\u0026ldquoIf we end up making massive compromises and if we keep caving in we are going to lose these people.\u0026ldquoBut there is also an opportunity because if she gets this right she will have two clear years of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo politics before the next election, and Labour could be in cataclysmic meltdown by then.Furious Labour supporters call for Jeremy Corbyn to QUIT\u0026ldquoIf we get ahead of the game the Conservatives could secure a phenomenal victory in 2022.Jacob Rees-Mogg said the result showed that \u0026ldquothere is no margin for us in delivering a soggy Brexit.He added: \u0026ldquoThis is the electoral evidence we needed.\u0026ldquoWe have picked up the Ukip vote, our electoral prospects are now entirely tied in with ensuring that Brexit is successful.Lord Howard, who served as leader of the Tories between 2003 and 2005 said: \u0026ldquoI think the results show that Mrs May needs to do the right thing for the country and I believe the right thing for the country is a clean Brexit.Follow us for the latest pictures from the polling stations as Britons head to the polls to cast their ballots for their local councils.1 of 12\u0026ldquoFor me that means coming out of the customs union and the single market.The Liberal Democrats, who gained ground during the local election, are putting pressure on Labour to rethink its muddled Brexit policies by offering a stronger opposition to the Tory stance.Ms May\u0026rsquos party gained control of four councils largely thanks to a lack of turnout from Ukip.Paul Oakley, Ukip\u0026rsquos general secretary compared his party to \u0026ldquothe black death after its dismal performance.The UK is set to depart at 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019Boris Johnson said: \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn has been abandoned in many Leave areas -

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From that moment I knew I could never live like a normal person - I was now a daughter of the revolution.That same day as the violence in the square a Syrian army officer, loyal to Assad, was pulled from his car by armed men, and killed in front of his son and nephew.As the clock tower event had been a defining moment for Noura and the rebels, thousands of loyalists turned out at the officers funeral, showing their support for Assad and his government.Syria had been split down the middle.The anti-Assad rebels were united by their hatred of the president, but they were otherwise disparate, with different rebel factions clashing with each other as they pushed for their own kind of revolution.As tensions rose, and Assads army tried harder to suppress protesters, members of the movement started taking up arms to defend themselves.After six months of protests, a full-scale civil war broke out.Government tanks rolled into Homs, firing at ordinary Syrians and destroying buildings.Meanwhile, Western leaders, like then US President Obama, started calling for Assad to step aside.The United Nations arranged peace talks, but these went nowhere.Western leaders largely wanted Assad to step aside, but he had a powerful ally in Putin.The Russian leadership had long-supported the Syrian regime, with the USSR first establishing ties with the Syrian government in the 1970s.Assad refused to step down voluntarily, and his enemies decided they would have to make him resign.A rebel army, made up of civilians and led by soldiers who had decided to defect, was formed.They were called the Free Syrian Army (FSA) - and they set their sights on conquering the populous city of Aleppo.They thought that if they could liberate the city, they would quickly gain the upper hand, and be able to force Assad out by Christmas 2012.But it wasnt meant to be - the FSA were ill-equipped and struggled against the official Syrian troops.President Obama was reluctant to provide weapons to the rebels, but a clear line was drawn against the Assad regime - the use of chemical warfare.During this time, Islamist groups had also started forming their own armies, some funded by Gulf States like Qatar and some backed by terrorists like Al-Qaeda.By 2013, the rebels and government forces were stuck in stalemate, with some opposition groups fighting each other and Islamist groups fighting everyone else.Pro-Assad Iran and Russia stepped up their efforts to support the regime, fearing the US could sweep in and gain a foothold in the Middle East if the government fell.Hezbollah, the extremist Lebanese group backed by Iran, joined the Syrian Army, bolstering Assad - something the documentary describes as a turning point.As things became more tangled, the human cost was greater than ever, with six million Syrians displaced from their homes and many more trapped in Islamist rebel-held areas, slowly dying of starvation.Then - worst of all - that September saw destructive Sarin gas chemical attacks on civilians in Damascus.Many of the victims were young children - but although Assad had crossed a line, the West was reluctant to intervene, for fears of antagonising Russia and making the war worse.That would change with the arrival of a deadly new force – Islamic State.The group used the chaos to gain the advantage, fighting against both the government and the moderate Syrian opposition.On 4 March 2013, hundreds of people – a mix of radicals and moderate fighters - swept in to the city of Raqqa, driving out government forces.With nobody in control of the city, moderate rebels called for democracy while IS - which ended up getting its way - wanted Sharia law.The terror group tightened its grip, assassinating rival leaders and imposing their strict interpretations of Sharia law on the residents of Raqqa, making the city their de facto capital.Then IS began to take more areas of desert in the north of the country, also taking over the country’s lucrative gas and oil fields in these areas.Meanwhile, in the hotly-contested capital of Damascus, neighbourhoods became war zones.The Syrian army - fighting for Assad - was losing and desperately needed more men. With the help of Iran and Hezbollah, a new pro-Government group – the National Defence Forces (NDF) was started.In Aleppo, too, the rebels seemed to be winning.Government supporters controlled only a couple of streets, in a deadly tug of war with paramilitary groups. One told Doucet they were “living in a nightmare”.It was simply not just a Syrian war. With the interjection of these other groups, there were a lot of nationalities fighting. The front lines kept shifting for years while civilians gravely suffered.This lead to a major refugee crisis. People poured into neighbouring Turkey and Jordan, then headed to the West.The UN estimates 5 million people are refugees outside of Syria, while 6million have been displaced around the country.For three years, the US had held back from airstrikes against Assad – but they couldn’t sit by and do nothing while IS, plotting deadly terror attacks in the West, grew stronger.So in September 2014, they sent their first fighter jets to the country.Meanwhile, it looked as if the regime would lose control of Aleppo – many of the hard-line Islamist fighters joined the rebels there, and the rebels took the city of Idlib.This is when Putin came in to lend a hand to his ally, and by October 2015, the first Russian planes appeared over Aleppo.The UK was also pressurised into fighting - but against IS, rather that the regime.With a Commons vote under David Cameron, we vowed to launch targeted airstrikes against ISIS held territory and became one of the many nations involved in Syria’s tangled war.In total, the doc claims 75 countries have been affected by the crisis in some way: either by funding or supporting a group on either side, by taking part in strikes or through involvement with the displaced refugees.The whole time, the Syrian government had been bombing and besieging rebel-held areas, with many civilians caught in the crossfire.Aleppo was bombed heavily by the Syrian government, and by summer 2016, much of the city was in ruin.Russian and Syrian war planes pounded rebel areas of Aleppo, and the suffering of ordinary people was immense.“We expected death every day because of the huge amount of shelling,” one doctor tells Doucet.On 3 October that year, a chlorine gas bomb hit a hospital in rebel-held Aleppo in a targeted attack. “The smell of death was everywhere,” says one eyewitness.Three medical workers were killed, and many more injured. Witnesses blamed pro-regime airstrikes, and the same hospital was bombed four times in just a few weeks.The deliberate targeting of hospitals is a war crime – but the Syrian Government said Al-Qaeda terrorists were using it as a base in order to justify their attack. The medical staff at the hospital said this was untrue.By now, the Syrian army and its allies could sense victory.The rebels, fatigued and out-gunned, were losing ground - and on 22 December 2016 the four-year Battle of Aleppo was over, won by the regime.Clearly, Assad would not be brought down by military force.Yet, the war is not over. A new regime offensive launched earlier this year to take back the last of the rebel enclaves in Syria.And in April the suburban town of Duoma, on the outskirts of Damascus was targeted by a chemical weapon, killing 70 people.France, the US and UK launched a joint targeted airstrike against the regimes chemical weapons facilities in response - sucking the West deeper into the mire of a war which has cost so much already.Part 2 of Syria: the Worlds War airs tonight at 9pm on BBC2, and both parts can be viewing on BBC iPlayer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats the message of these local elections around the country - that Conservative councils deliver great local services at lower taxes.The PM added: We wont take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.Earlier Mr Corbyn held a rally in Plymouth, where Labour won the council in one of its few major victories of the local elections.He insisted that the story of the night was Ukip losing ground - and claimed theres much more to come from Labour despite their election flop.But elections expert Sir John Curtice said: The truth is there isnt really much for the Labour party to celebrate this morning.On a night of mixed fortunes for both main parties:A Labour shadow minister told The Sun last night: “Jeremy has not spent the 11 months since the General Election winning Middle England, and now never will.We’re not going to do as well as we should, and I suspect these results will show we are past peak Corbyn.”Speaking in Plymouth, the Labour leader was asked if Britain has reached peak Corbyn and replied: No, no, theres much more to come and its going to get even better.Asked why Labour had failed to make the predicted gains, Mr Corbyn said: The story of the night is that Ukip have collapsed across the country, that we have gained in Plymouth.We have also put up our vote in a lot of other places and gained wards weve never held before in some of the London boroughs.Were ready for a General Election whenever it comes.In a statement he added: Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections.We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.His deputy Tom Watson insisted the party was quietly satisfied by the result.Labours other big win overnight was in Trafford, held by the Tories since 2014, where Labour is now the largest party.But the Conservatives held on to Labour target Swindon, and took control in Peterborough and Basildon - while Labour lost their majority in Derby and Nuneaton.In Birmingham, a traditionally Labour-dominated city, the Tories did better than expected, prompting suggestions they could take control, but Labour ended up hanging on.Labour made gains in London, adding to its vote across the capital - but in an embarrassing blow, they failed to take control in the key target councils of Wandsworth, Westminster and Hillingdon despite pouring resources into the seats.Mr Corbyns followers also lost out in the North London seat of Barnet, where the anti-Semitism scandal appears to have an impact.Labour MP Jess Phillips took aim at her leader this morning, tweeting:  I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.Labour bosses appeared to admit they had made a mistake by hyping up expectations of huge gains in London and elsewhere.Campaigns chief Andrew Gwynne said the party was never likely to take the Tories flagship London councils and admitted Labour had seen disappointing results in many parts of the country.Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: Its clearly a good night for us, weve done better than expected.But its just stage one of the work we want to do over the next few years leading to the next General Election.Boris Johnson added: No one is going to be complacent about these results, we are going to work very, very hard... [but] it has been an encouraging night.With all but a handful of councils declared, Labour had gained 64 wards and the Lib Dems 61, with the Tories losing 20 - and Ukip almost totally wiped out.Overall, Labour won many more seats than the Conservatives because this years local elections mostly took place in urban areas where the left tends to be stronger.The pro-EU Lib Dems took Kingston and Richmond-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Tories, as well as holding on to the other councils they controlled.MP Christine Jardine told the BBC: Its a good night for us - and its a long time since we felt that.Leader Vince Cable added: Were very much on the way back.In Plymouth, one of Labours major bright spots, local Tory MP Johnny Mercer blamed the partys defeat on cuts to the military with defence being one of the areas major employers.He said: Ive made very public my concerns around the handling of defence at the moment and what the vision is.As well as council elections across England, there was one parliamentary by-election - Sinn Fein easily held on to the seat of West Tyrone, where the previous MP quit after mocking IRA victims.Counts are continuing throughout today, with the final results not expected until this evening in some areas.If todays results were replicated in a General Election, the Tories would lose a dozen seats with the Lib Dems making gains - meaning Theresa May would no longer have a majority even with the DUPs support.More than 4,250 council seats were up for grabs in more than 150 areas.It was the first electoral test for both Labour and the Tories since last years general election where Mrs May lost her majority and Mr Corbyn won an extra 30 seats for Labour.Both parties have experienced setbacks in recent weeks - with Mr Corbyns Labour being blasted with an anti-Semitism scandal, and the Tories being hit with the Windrush saga, which claimed the scalp of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.All parties were nervous ahead of today’s counts, having failed to see the shock 2017 election result coming when Theresa May threw away a massive poll lead and Mr Corbyn stormed to 40 per cent of the national vote.One Tory grandee said last night: “After 2017, we’ve all learned not to trust our very best instincts”.Local elections were held in all 32 London boroughs, 30 metropolitan districts, 17 unitary authorities and 67 district councils across England.Five council mayors were also up for election in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, as well as a metro mayor election for the new Sheffield city region.Yesterday scores of voters faces trouble casting their ballots and were even turned away, as a controversial new voting system which required ID was trialled in parts of the country.And Bradford Council apologised for demanding some voters present ID when they didnt need to.Meanwhile, voters flocked to the polls to take adorable snaps of their pet pooches too, as the #DogsAtPollingStations trend took off for the fourth year running."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000296276516.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ex army general lord richards defence spending","story":"The declining power of Britain’s military is giving off a signal of weakness, Lord Richards said yesterday.Issuing his siren alarm, the Army general insisted enemies such as Russia “will call our bluff” and mount an attack on the UK or our allies.The peer told The House magazine: “It’s got to be substantial amounts of money that the government must spend on the Armed Forces over the next ten years, if they’re to provide the influence on a day-to-day basis that we need in the post-Brexit era.“If there is any doubt about that, then the chances of conflict are increased because our opponents will call our bluff or seek to call our bluff.“Some of what I’m seeing suggests that we are getting perilously close to that.”Aggressive Russian president Vladimir Putin will pose the biggest test to Britain’s military resolve, he added.Lord Richards said: “If all countries continue not to invest in their Armed Forces over the next few years, then there will be a risk that Russian and other adventurism will catch us out.”While declaring he is “very pleased” with new Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s fight for more forces cash, the ex-Chief of Defence Staff said “the jury is out” on whether he will be a good forces boss.Lord Richards added: “He loses nothing by doing his job, which is to push the case for more spending on the Armed Forces.“It’s whether or not he succeeds that will determine one’s judgment.”Downing Street hit back at the general’s criticisms.The PM’s spokesman said: “We don’t agree. The defence budget is increasing to make sure we have the armed forces we need to defend the country”.More than 150 faced having to leave if they did not pay a £2,389 visas bill.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have proven that my work is not yet finished.Thank you for the invitation, however, your offer is precisely the reason why I am campaigning in the first place. You have proven that my work is not yet finished.Im really sorry but I find this really insulting. Im not here to go on TV to find love. I dont like it when people find love for me.Just because we have conditions or syndromes, we should not be called Undateable - Im very insulted by this.My campaign is raising awareness on bullying and facial disfigurements.The show is not the platform that Im looking to promote my campaign, I fully understand that youre doing your job but we are doing ours as well.We should not have named shows, if the show had a different name, I may reconsider the idea.I feel for the people who go on as I feel like they feel pressured into doing the show, they may not feel uncomfortable with doing the show, I certainly wouldnt feel happy with finding love on TV and someone doing it for me.Perceptions need to change and I think now is the time to do something about this.My campaign is raising awareness for bullying and raising awareness on Treacher Collins Syndrome.When were approached by researchers for shows and journalists for stories it can be an upsetting time.I might get snubbed by future production teams who make programmes for Channel 4, ITV and BBC.Couple of my friends have been approached and they dont like the program, nor do I due to the name.We are not and should not be called UNDATEABLE.We are all amazing and should be treated with care and love.Not for me this time, but if you could pass my details to other teams who might be working on programmes that suit my cause.Look forward to your reply.Im really sorry but I find this really insulting. Im not here to go on TV to find love. I dont like it when people find love for me.Just because we have conditions or syndromes, we should not be called Undateable - Im very insulted by this.He added: We are normal people living an amazing life.The programme claims to follow new singletons with a variety of conditions through the high and lows of finding love.However, critics of the show say it perpetuates stereotypes about people living with disabilities and other conditions.The show is not the platform that Im looking to promote my campaign, I fully understand that youre doing your job but we are doing ours as well.We should not have named shows, if the show had a different name, I may reconsider the idea.A spokesman for the show said: “When looking for contributors for this much-commended show the production team approach a wide number of individuals, experts and charities and nobody who is approached is assumed to be single or deemed to be ‘undateable’ but rather we hope they will help us spread the word reaching people who may like to take part.Those who have previously appeared have spoken overwhelmingly in support of the programme and have found it a really positive experience.”"},{"url":null,"title":"love stories consent apps","story":"It’s been reported that, in the era of #MeToo, some youngsters are using technology to help them get off.No, I’m not talking about rampant rabbits - consent apps are apparently the new thing among the younger generation to make sure they’re not raping each other.One of these apps, called uConsent, is “meant for communication about sex” creator Cody Swann claims.“This is like a digital handshake agreement” says Swann.Obviously anything that champions safety and awareness is a good thing – but with some apps suggesting that a couple takes a “state-of- mind test” to figure out who is drunk, and therefore unable to shag with consent, there’s a serious danger of creating something straight out of Black Mirror.What’s more, the apps – another is LegalFling - carry no legal weight in court cases so there’s a danger that these digital records arent as watertight as users may think.Not only does it denigrate the seriousness of rape (consent isn’t up for discussion with a rapist) but it completely undermines that vital spark in sexual relationships.What happens to romance when we trade the power of a wink or a glance for a QR code that’s been generated after you’ve ticked the Ts and Cs?We’re throwing away the most exciting part of human interaction, those few seconds where no one is sure what’s going to happen before someone goes in for the first kiss.As passion and spontaneity is yanked out from any potentially steamy moment, what might our favourite movie scenes if apps like uConsent were involved?It’s starting to rain.

Studies have revealed that children who get more rest at night perform better at maths, science and reading. Sleeping is essential to a child’s development. Most children need at least nine hours’ sleep every night to be happy and healthy.Yet 400,000 kids in this country currently do not have a proper bed of their own to sleep in.They are forced to share with parents, sleep on sofas or even the floor. That’s why The Sun has teamed up with the charity Buttle UK’s Chances for Children campaign, and Dreams Beds, to help solve Britain’s growing bed crisis. Our Beds for Kids campaign will help to donate beds to those kids who do not have one.In this special four-page pullout, The Sun chats to a sleep expert about your child’s sleep needs, and we answer all your questions on battles over bedtime.WE all need sleep. It’s crucial to the quality of our lives and our wellbeing.While we rest, our body repairs itself and builds proteins and hormones essential for us to use during the day.But how much sleep we need and the pattern of that sleep varies from person to person and changes throughout our lives.YOUR beautiful new baby is asleep more than they are awake.For the first two years of a child’s life, their brain and body are growing at a rapid rate – more than it will ever grow in the rest of their lifetime.A newborn baby needs to eat and sleep – this is what keeps them alive.Most wake every few hours to eat – and 95 per cent cry with a night awakening that will need a parental response.Tots spend most of their time in light sleep, known as REM.Their twitching bodies and jerky eye movements are a clear sign of this stage.A newborn’s sleep cycle is 40 minutes long and they wake regularly.This is an evolutionary function so that your baby can be roused easily to eat or be alert to danger.hours of sleep are lost each night in first year of being a parent – 3,330 hours by time kids turn threeAS your baby becomes older, they will begin to regulate their body rhythms and their busy little minds are learning so much about the world.Sleep is essential to an infant’s healthy development. They need sleep to absorb language, form attachments and learn behavioural cues.By this age, their sleeping patterns have changed and most sleep is happening at night.Night waking occurs among 50 per cent of children who previously slept through the night.Most sleep problems in children are temporary and do not have long-lasting side effects.By nine months, a baby’s sleep cycle has matured and your infant is able to sleep for longer periods.AFTER their first birthday, toddlers sleep for 11 to 14 hours. Their sleep cycle is still just 40 minutes but now they can self-soothe and go back to sleep on their own.They can cope with less sleep. Instead of having lots of broken periods, one-year-olds enjoy longer runs of deep sleep during the night.But with more independence, sleep problems such as anxiety arise. Toddlers can start to wake more often in the night, aware they are alone in the dark in a big bed – and some will feel afraid.Parents need to respond carefully. Nap strikes can occur as toddlers assert themselves, but if they don’t get enough sleep they won’t produce enough sleep-inducing hormones and could become sleep-deprived.Helping a child calm down before bed is key. Offer carbs and warm milk to encourage a good night’s rest.of us are unhappy with the amount of sleep we get each nightMOST children at this age will need about 12 hours’ sleep.As a child gets older, more slow-wave, non-rapid eye-movement sleep occurs earlier in the night, with an increase of REM later.During the day, a preschooler’s brain is worked constantly as they learn.You may find their little bodies will become tired more quickly and your child could start asking to go to bed earlier.Try to keep to your normal bedtime routine. Sleep problems with anxiety can occur as a child becomes more aware of risk and the dangers around them.Preschoolers are very visual and three-year-olds can start to experience night terrors as they begin to be exposed to more television programmes or books, causing worry.Night terrors typically show in the first few hours of sleep.of us manage to get between seven and eight hours of shut-eye a nightAS your child grows up, they need less sleep. But with their busy social life, exam revision and increasing homework, plus a drama or football class after school, they must not skip sleep.School-age kids who do can be irritable and have difficulty with memory, attention and reasoning.Research also shows that kids who don’t have a regular bedtime are more likely to have problems with hyper-activity and bonding with peers.Children are on the go 24/7, never switching off their computers, endlessly checking phones, in touch with a world that never sleeps. This is having devastating effects on sleep and wellbeing.Kids should not watch TV or use computers before bed as the bright light emitted suppresses production of melatonin – the major sleep hormone.YOUR teen’s brain is undergoing huge change during sleep – and they still need more kip than an adult.The chemical imbalances and changes that occur during adolescence are equivalent to having schizophrenia.Teens are impulsive and sometimes unable to think rationally or make wise decisions as their brain develops.They are useless at getting up in the morning, often feeling lethargic.This is down to a shift in their body clock which means sleep-inducing hormone melatonin will not be released until around 11pm, continuing until 8am.So your teen finds it hard to switch off until the midnight hours, and even harder to wake in time for school. This is why some schools are considering later start times for teens, to tackle sleep deprivation and improve education.of kids are more likely to become obese if they fail to get at least eight hours a nightWITH 69 per cent of kids under the age of ten affected by sleep problems, getting enough rest is the key to keeping children happy.Sammy Margo, author of The Good Sleep Guide For Kids, gives her top tips for helping your child get a good night’s rest.THINK PINK: Colours have a strong influence on our mood and feelings. While blues and purples can be calming, they can also be cold.Pinks will soothe and calm, and greens are thought to have a balancing and harmonious effect. The ideal colours to send your child off to sleep peacefully are pale shades of pink and green.KEEP IT DARK: We sleep better without light. Where possible, prevent natural light from peeking around the blinds or curtains.Some children may be afraid of the dark so using a green or yellow night light and something that doesn’t shine in your child’s eyes can help.BANISH SCREENS: Studies show that children who watch TV or play with tablets in their rooms get less sleep, with some even rising earlier in the morning to watch TV at the expense of sleep.We know that exposure to blue light interferes with the release of your sleepy hormone melatonin, so this can impact on the quality and quantity of your child’s sleep.Try setting a technology cut-off time and ensure that you limit their screen time.WEAR WOOL: Although expensive, wool is ideal for bed covers. Its heat-regulating qualities will keep your child warm in cold weather and cool in the heat.Children sleep better in a cooler room, so aim for around 16-18C. This can help everyone to get a better night’s rest and sleep for longer.FOOD FOR THOUGHT: To help your child feel ready for sleep, give them a bedtime snack. Porridge contains small amounts of melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep.Bananas contain melatonin and serotonin — another the sleep hormone — and muscle relaxant magnesium. Mash them with warm milk and a little honey for a super-sleep combination.EXERCISE IS KEY: Every child should have 60 active minutes of exercise a day. Divide the time into 15-minute slots throughout the day.Exercise in the daylight will help your child feel tired at bedtime and sleep well through the night. The combination of exercise and daylight works to regulate the body’s sleep/wake cycle.ROUTINE AT THE READY: A bedtime ritual can be hugely effective in making sure your child sleeps well every night.Children love rhythm and routine. Set aside time for a simple bedtime routine such as a warm, relaxing bath, followed by a bedtime story and a sleep-inducing glass of warm milk.Then dim the lights and watch as your child glides off into the Land of Nod.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s very important to her that both her parents have roles in her wedding.”Speculation had mounted for months over whether dad Thomas would attend on May 19.But as The Sun revealed last month it was always  his intention to be at his daughter’s side.He has now been measured up for his Royal Wedding suit by his local tailor in Rosarito, Mexico. He spent 15 minutes inside the small backstreet wedding and tuxedo shop — a short drive from his ocean-side home.Thomas was casually dressed in black trousers and a dark navy polo shirt, with a pair of glasses hooked on the front.A young shop worker was seen measuring his arm, neck, waist and legs with a roll of white tape. Sources said it is likely his measurements will be sent on to a top tailors in London.One source said “He was all smiles at the local tailors.“Thomas was just getting measured in preparation for his wedding suit. That store is the only one close to where he lives.” A spokesman for the Mexican  tailors refused to comment. Prince Harry, 33, is still to meet  his future  father-in-law who US actress Meghan is said to “adore”.They will get together for the first time in the days before the wedding. The source added: “Thomas cannot wait to fly to the UK to see Meghan and meet Prince Harry for the first time. He will be extremely nervous, but his family are backing him.“Despite some of the squabbles in the family, he is the one who joins them all together. He still has the respect of virtually everyone.”Thomas married yoga instructor Doria  in 1979. They divorced in 1988 and he now lives alone.It was also revealed yesterday that Meghan and Harry will follow tradition and spend the night before their wedding apart. Meghan will stay with her social worker mum at a secret location.She is only having children as her bridesmaids and page boys — including Princess Charlotte, three, and Prince George, four.She won’t have a Maid of Honour or chief bridesmaid.  A spokesman said: “She has a very close group of friends and didn’t want to choose one over the other.”It emerged that Kate will be at the wedding but new baby Prince Louis won’t. Prince Harry also wanted to remember his late mum Princess Diana  on the big day.So all three of her three siblings Earl Spencer, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale will be present with their families — and Lady Jane will give a reading.Harry and Meghan will live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OUR ten-year-old daughter just cannot sleep. She reads and reads, often until 11pm. We have tried asking her to switch off the light but she just wriggles around, making sure we are aware that she is still awake.She’s terrible in the mornings and we are sure she would be a happier person with more sleep but we have no idea how to make that happen. What should we do?A. As parents you are the best people to help your child learn to sleep independently. However, at times you may feel exhausted, stressed and worried about the amount of sleep your child may or may not be getting.Create a bedtime box that you make with your child. Put all the things she will need to feel safe at night into the box and do this every bedtime – maybe something soft to touch, pictures of you and safe books about sleep.Instruct her to go through these items at bedtime as a signpost toward sleep, helping to distract her from negative thoughts and feelings.The foundation of relaxing and habitualising her to her room and bed should be done by helping her feel that she is part of the process.Q. I HAVE just moved my 20-month-old toddler from a cot to a bed and he now ends up in my bed every night. What can I do to break this habit?A. Place different things under his pillow at night so he is excited about going to bed. Change the item on a daily basis.The idea is to create curiosity and surprise, encouraging a positive association with bedtime. Ground children in sight, sound, touch and smell, and use things they can see, hear, feel and smell to make them feel safe.Get your child used to his bed both day and night. The more time your child spends there, the more he will accept it. Do not leave him to cry unattended for a long period, as this will create a negative association, and try to not take him into your bed. Instead, lie next to him so he feels safe.Do this for each wake. It should take about two weeks to resolve.Q. MY daughter is 11 and struggles to get to sleep. She goes to bed at around 9pm and has to be up for school by 6.45am. But she becomes anxious about not being able to sleep.I tell her to read until she’s sleepy – or failing that, turn the lights out and listen to an audiobook. I don’t allow screens for an hour before bedtime, but other than that I’m clueless. How much sleep does she actually need?A. We hear a lot about getting your child into a good routine being essential for good sleep. But the interesting thing here is that routines are NOT the Holy Grail to sleep. Routine is just a small part of your sleep plan at night.Yes, a routine may be the only thing you need to do to help some babes sleep. But in my years of experience, it’s usually more than that.One key factor that most people miss is the environment. To get your child to sleep, you must ensure their bedroom is conducive to sleep. Would you sleep here? Help your child feel safe at night by ensuring their room isn’t too dark. Anxious children do not sleep. If it is too dark, then they will wake and call out for us. Also, do make sure they are not too cold or too hot.Most importantly, get her to write her worries in a worry book and place pictures of you around their room so she feels safe when you are not there.ASSESS: Analyse what’s happening, what you need to do and what your child’s needs are.UNDERSTAND: What is your child trying to communicate?SOOTH: Comfort your child appropriatelyEXIT: Leave the room and allow your child to sleep.Q. MY five-year-old wakes very early in the morning, about 5.30am, and it’s hard to convince him to go back to sleep. I can’t put him to bed later because he’s exhausted after school and begging to go to bed by 7pm. What can I do?A. Children are supposed to wake during the night and rise early but this is not ideal for us.Sleeping like a baby does not mean deep sleep. In fact, children are naturally light sleepers.They have more periods of light sleep than adults and these periods last longer.To combat early rising, you need to charm your child back to sleep. First think about your mental state. Are you calm and relaxed? A child can quickly pick up on your mood – if you are feeling stressed, so is your child.Focus on your breathing, by taking one breath at a time. This will slow your heart rate and relax any tension in your body. When you have focused on your breathing for two minutes, pick your child up, hold them close and breathe deeply in their ear steadily and rhythmically.The thought “my child will never sleep” is usually what most of my parents say crosses their mind – and when it does, it leads them to do all kinds of undesirable things, such as driving their child across town in order to allow sleep to happen, or rocking or feeding to sleep.These actions will not help your child to sleep independently. So by changing the way you think and having more helpful thoughts, you are more likely to act in a way that helps your child to sleep.Q. MY three-year-old daughter has just started having terrible nightmares. She wakes in the night and cries out for me and it takes her a very long time to calm down.What can I do to reassure her?A. Practise mindfulness. Sleep issues such as night terrors can make parents very anxious.At night, you want to be able to comfort your child in a way that means they are not dependent on you and also gets them back off to sleep.I use the “pause” method, which is popular in France and matches your response to the level of distress your child is in. It involves watching them for a few minutes to see if they go back to sleep, rather than rushing in and picking them up.GETTING your baby or tot to sleep, and stay asleep, is no easy feat.So here are some of the best aids to help exhausted parents . . .BEST FOR CUDDLING . . .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We hope the PM and her ­europhile backbench rebels realise it.Some half-baked customs compromise, or another forced on it by a ­Commons vote, will be a knife to the Government’s jugular and hand Ukip an unlikely route back from the dead.Some argue that voters couldn’t care less about the customs union. But wait till they realise that staying in one ends our newly-won independence as a  trading nation and locks us for ever into voiceless subservience to the EU.Brexit voters would be merciless.So Mrs May MUST heed her Cabinet Brexiters over her Remainer aides, dump her foolish “customs partnership” fudge and face her rebels down. She must then challenge the EU to get serious about solving the Irish border issue.Millions of Tory votes count on it.The party has a right to celebrate its election victories and improved  campaigning team. But it also has to recognise the precarious position it’s in.The ­Government is in a state of paralysis. It must start offering something positive to Remainers — especially those under 47 who lean towards Labour.Jeremy Corbyn’s vision is economically insane, but at least he has one. The Government must make the case for capitalism over socialism and give younger voters a real stake in it. A huge increase in affordable homes is vital.The Tories cannot survive on Brexit alone.AT long last voters have given Corbyn’s toxic party the bloody nose it deserves.Its rampant anti-Semitism killed it in Barnet. Maybe lefties’ racist barracking of new Home Secretary Sajid Javid online cost Labour elsewhere. Corbyn’s excuses for Russia and Assad didn’t help.Nor do voters like being hectored in public by arrogant young Corbyn cultists convinced of their own moral superiority.Brexit-backers, meanwhile, know Labour cannot be trusted. Especially not while it supports staying in a customs union.WHY did it take so long to reprieve brave Afghan interpreters from deportation and let them stay here without paying a penny?It was blatantly unfair on people who  served our country. Yet a simple decision took months. Why? Sajid Javid sorted it days after arriving at the Home Office.The Tories are too slow to right  obvious wrongs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Two homes have been burned down.The lava can reach temperatures of around 1,150C but some residents were taking the dangers in their stride, used to life on an island which has five active volcanoes.Keone Kalawe, 58, who is volunteering at an evacuation centre in Pahoa, described the latest quake as \"just part of life over here\".Regarding the lava, he said: \"I tell people - you just have to sidestep.\"One of the other concerns, however, is the high level of sulphur dioxide gas near the volcano, a major reason behind the evacuation orders.Dr Janine Krippner, volcanologist at Concord University in West Virginia, told Sky News: \"It\u0027s pretty much impossible at this time to tell how long this might go on for - specific fissures might stop or start with no warning.\"Unfortunately these fissures have opened up right inside an area where people are living, so the biggest risk right now is inundation of lava in people\u0027s homes...and the gases themselves can cause quite a bit of respiratory distress.\" When asked what evacuated residents might return to after the danger has passed, she said: \"Unfortunately with lava flows, sometimes you can\u0027t just move back."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-may-corbyn-theresa_4299966.jpg?20180503181846 ","title":"have jeremy corbyn and theresa may both passed their peak","story":"In 2017, Labour massively overachieved against expectations.In 2018 it has underachieved, and the problem for the Labour leader is that it might show a natural high watermark for his appeal.The party has a small town problem that blocks its path to a general election majority.But although a disaster did not occur, these results also confirm that we are past peak May, though we knew that already from the general election.The party has a big city problem that also blocks its path to general election victory, and it lost Plymouth, Richmond to the Liberal Democrats, and Trafford, its bastion in Greater Manchester.:: Local elections - the results as they happen The Conservatives won the expectations game, partly because they held onto Wandsworth in southwest London.Of greater concern now, is that Conservative critics of the Brexit plan, who had kept their powder dry until after the vote, will now take the gloves off.Indeed the most consequential decision of the day might well be the information smuggled out, as polls closed, on Brexit.As Sky News has pointed out over the past week, the Government is looking to push the Commons votes on stripping out Lords amendments past summer into the autumn.And that in a week when the PM promised Cabinet a \"robust response\" to the Lords\u0027 repeated defeats of the Government on the EU Withdrawal Bill.It shows that the Government is not confident of a majority on many of these issues, and complicates the negotiation.It means time is running out."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may_4300493.jpg?20180504122834 ","title":"labour and tories both ambling like zombies after local elections","story":"This speaks of a hyper-polarised politics.

We\u0027ve taken control in Basildon and Peterborough.\"And that\u0027s all the result of the really hard work of our councillors, our activists, our supporters and our revitalised campaign machine.\"But we won\u0027t take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.\" In the wake of rows over the Windrush generation and Brexit, with the former precipitating the resignation of Amber Rudd as home secretary, the PM will take some encouragement from her party\u0027s performance.The Tories gained Peterborough, Southend and Basildon, the latter a result of capitalising on UKIP\u0027s demise.In London, the Conservatives successfully defended Wandsworth and Westminster despite Labour hopes they could take both.Kensington and Chelsea stayed blue, despite anger over the Grenfell Tower fire.London Mayor Sadiq Khan had said before the vote: \"There is now no corner of London where Labour can\u0027t win - and with enough hard work we can challenge the Tories even in their crown jewels of Wandsworth and Barnet.\" Meanwhile, Dudley remained in no overall control, but the council\u0027s Tory leader was confident a UKIP councillor and independent Conservative would join their group to hand them effective control.However, the loss of a number of councils to the Lib Dems in pro-EU areas will cause concern among the party\u0027s Remain wing.He added: \"We were defending seats that were last won in 2014, which was a particularly good year for Labour in local government.\"Obviously, I am disappointed at any places where we lost a bit of ground, but if you look at the overall picture, Labour gained a lot of seats across the whole country, we gained a lot of votes in places we never had those votes before.\"Mr Corbyn said the party was \"ready for a general election whenever it comes\".Labour figures described their performance as \"solid\" and said the party had consolidated gains made in last year\u0027s general election.Many within the party also pointed out that by its calculations, close results in four wards meant they missed out on victory in Wandsworth by just 141 votes. But a number of disappointing results will give critics of the Labour leader fresh ammunition.In the Midlands, the party lost control of Derby and Nuneaton and Bedworth and failed to take the target council of Walsall.Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the party in the Midlands and North had \"some big questions to ask ourselves\".Streatham MP Chuka Umunna told Sky News that Labour should have been making \"much more progress\" given the Government\u0027s recent troubles - and called for a party inquiry into its performance.There had been fears Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism row would affect the party\u0027s performance in areas with a high Jewish population.The party failed to win control of the north London borough of Barnet, which, according to the 2011 census, is home to 20% of the Jewish population of England and Wales. Defeated councillor Adam Langleben said Labour had been \"punished\" by voters over what he characterised as the national party\u0027s refusal to confront the issue.Mr Langleben claimed Mr Corbyn did not even understand the problem and called on him to visit the borough and apologise.Deputy leader Tom Watson admitted the Jewish community had \"sent us a message\" and said Labour had lessons to learn.There was plenty to cheer for the Lib Dems, who gained Kingston, Richmond and South Cambridgeshire from the Tories amid signs of a Brexit backlash in some areas.The party, which saw a net gain of more than 70 councillors, also secured the Hertfordshire council of Three Rivers from no overall control."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/17/11/2048x1152/skynews-meghan-markle-father-tom_4168403.jpg?20171128092504 ","title":"meghans father to walk her down the aisle at royal wedding","story":"Explaining that both of Meghan\u0027s parents would have \"important roles in the wedding\", the palace said that \"on the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle\".The palace said it expected the journey to \"take them along part of the Long Walk, allowing members of the public gathered there to see the car as it passes\".It added that \"Mr Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel\".There has been speculation over whether Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas, would be performing the traditional role.Some reports said Meghan was worried about how her dad, who is said to value his privacy, would handle the pressure.Other reports said the 73-year-old was \"excited\" and looking forward to the big day.Prince Harry is \"keen to involve his mother\u0027s family in his wedding\", it continued, adding that \"all three siblings of Diana, Princess of Wales will be in attendance and Lady Jane Fellowes will give the reading\".Harry and Meghan \"both feel honoured that Lady Jane will be representing her family and helping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day\".While the wedding will be \"guided by tradition\", it will also reflect the \"personalities of Prince Harry and Ms Markle\".:: Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding dress and its place in royal fashion history In the week before the ceremony, more details about the bridesmaids and page boys, the florist and the baker making the wedding cake will be released.The full order of service will be published on the morning of the wedding.Members of the Royal Family will begin to arrive at 11.20am, prior to the ceremony at midday.Harry and his best man, Prince William, are likely to arrive by foot at the chapel\u0027s west steps.The palace said that would \"allow Their Royal Highnesses to acknowledge all of the people gathered in the Castle precincts, including the 200 charity representatives gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister at the bottom of the steps\".The service will take around an hour."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-jacob-rees-mogg-burley_4301071.jpg?20180505050549 ","title":"rees mogg just making sure govt keeps promises","story":"In an exclusive interview with Kay Burley, Jacob Rees-Mogg said they were simply encouraging the Government to keep its promises.He told Sky News: \"I have no authority to veto anything.\"I\u0027m a backbench Tory MP.\"The Conservative manifesto said that we would leave the customs union and we would leave the single market.\"I believe that politicians should implement the promises that they\u0027ve given in manifestos.\"So all I\u0027ve been doing -
