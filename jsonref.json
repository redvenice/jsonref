But for many people having a period is more than a slight inconvenience. When you consider that a woman has on average 450 periods in her lifetime and will spend up to £4,800 on tampons and sanitary towels alone, lack of access to period products is a real issue.Period poverty – the umbrella term used to describe lack of access to sanitary products due to financial restrictions – is worryingly common here in the UK.Homeless women, asylum seekers and refugees are particularly at risk, but a survey from Plan International reveals that one in 10 school girls in the UK have been unable to afford sanitary products, and 12 per cent have had to improvise using socks or newspapers. For generations women across the country have been living without access to sanitary products because they can’t afford them, but period poverty isn’t going away on its own. Access to period care is a basic human right, and considering that it affect half of the world’s population, it’s about time all women had access to tampons and pads. Here’s what you can do to help, whatever your income: The easiest and fastest way to drive change is by offering financial support to your local food bank, or charities and organisations like Bloody Good Period, who supply sanitary products to refugees and asylum seekers, If you’re not in the position to donate money directly, many brands have ‘give back’ schemes when you buy their products. Freda, an organic and eco-friendly period subscription service, donates a portion of their profits to initiatives worldwide tackling period poverty. Hey Girls offers a new type of sanitary pad which claims to be ‘leak free and comfortable’ as well as being chlorine and bleach free, and for every pack you buy they donate one to a girl in need. Since you have to buy pads and tampons on a regular basis, might as well help out women in need while you’re doing it.Boys should also be taught about periods (Picture: Ella Byworth for )The fact that period products aren’t free, let alone that they’re (still) taxed as a ‘luxury’, is infuriating, but being able to afford them is a privilege we often take for granted. There’s a slew of different sanitary products available, from pads and tampons to absorbent knickers and cups, all which can be donated (unused, obviously). You can search for your local food bank here and donate some products yourself, or go the extra mile and start a collection drive through initiatives like the Red Box Project, who provides free sanitary items to school girls, and The Homeless Period, which gives homeless women free access to period products. Want to make a morning out of it? Consider hosting a period brunch. Bear with me, it’s not as gross as it sounds. The initiative is called Bloody Big Brunch, and all you need to do is invite your friends over for brunch and serve Bloody Marys – that your guests have to pay for with a packet of period products, which you then donate.Period poverty ultimately requires political action, but luckily there’s plenty you can do help ensure that government have proper policy in place.You can start by joining the #FreePeriods campaign started by teen activist Amika George, which calls for girls from low income families to be given free menstrual products.  At the time of writing the online petition already has over 159,000 signatures, but more are needed.‘To me, as women, we face so many challenges in achieving true equality in society, and it seemed completely unfair that something as normal and natural as periods should hold us back further,’ says Ms George, who is currently studying for her A levels.‘I was really shocked that the government had refused to take action so I decided to try and lobby them so that these girls could be helped.‘Whether you flood your MP’s inbox with emails, or tweet incessantly telling them to make change happen, it does make a difference. ‘Campaigning is all about seeing a need for change, and then charging forward with every ounce of energy that you have to orchestrate that change.’Society’s inability to talk openly and honestly about female issues (or vaginas) not only ensures that periods remain a taboo, but also allows the patriarchy to prevent women from taking control of their own bodies. Menstruation is still often perceived as shameful, so much so that 48 per cent of girls aged 14-21 feel embarrassed by their periods, while 71 per cent have felt embarrassed buying sanitary products. The stigma underpins the real reason period poverty is so hard to talk about it – because most people feel like they can’t, or shouldn’t.Silence isn’t always golden, and talking about periods loud and proud is the only way to end the taboo surrounding them. ‘An important part of what I’m trying to achieve is to destigmatise periods,’ says Ms George. ‘We need to re-frame menstruation and stop being ashamed of our bodies. As women, we really need to start normalising conversations about our periods. Until that happens, it’ll continue to be a topic that has men running for the hills.Education about menstruation is also essential, and not just for girls, but young boys too. It’s vital that we’re all taught about periods in order to dispel myths and end the shame surrounding menstruation. It might seem like a small thing, but little by little proper knowledge about periods will lead to a society that recognises periods as a natural part of life rather than something disgusting or embarrassing.

King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/07/4BCB952700000578-0-image-m-15_1525327815445.jpg","title":"Chris Evans pays tribute mother Minnie returns air","story":"\u0027Mum was incredible, she needed to be at peace\u0027: Listeners...Share this article    Chris Evans, pictured with his mother Minnie at London\u0027s Chelsea Flower Show in 2000\u0027My mum was only supposed to last a month or two, but five months after this, seven months in all, she was still there.

He said he believes it was the same nerve agent type used to poison ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal (left) and his daughter Yulia (left)According to RT, Aleksey Pushkov said in a Twitter post: \u0027Novichok was produced and stored in the Czech territory in some small quantities. This fact is a crushing blow to London\u0027s theory that is already falling apart at the seams. \u0027London is confused: Its whole construct is crumbling.\u0027 Poisoned Russian spy Skripal and his daughter may have got...Fresh heartache for family of Sergei Skripal who say they...Russian pulls out of buying Margaret Thatcher\u0027s armoured...Share this articleRussian officials have previously suggested the nerve agent used for the attack may have originated in the Czech Republic, Sweden and Slovakia. Acting Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis called that claim a lie and the Czechs expelled three Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain.Neither the Czech agencies mentioned by Zeman nor the government have commented on the president\u0027s claims.          Czech Republic president Milos Zeman (pictured) is known for his pro-Kremlin viewsMeanwhile, the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said up to 100 grams of liquid nerve agent were used in the attack on Skripal and his daughter Yulia.Ahmet Uzumcu told the New York Times the amount of Novichok used - around half a cup of liquid - suggests it was created for use as a weapon rather than for research purposes.Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were left fighting for their lives in hospital after being found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4.The inquiry into the nerve agent attack in the Wiltshire city has involved 250 detectives who have gone through more than 5,000 hours of CCTV and interviewed more than 500 witnesses.Mr Uzumcu told the paper the Novichok could have been applied as a liquid or aerosol.He said: \u0027For research activities or protection you would need, for instance, five to 10 grams or so, but even in Salisbury it looks like they may have used more than that, without knowing the exact quantity, I am told it may be 50, 100 grams or so, which goes beyond research activities for protection.\u0027It\u0027s not affected by weather conditions. That explains, actually, that they were able to identify it after a considerable time lapse.\u0027He added the samples collected suggested the nerve agent was of \u0027high purity\u0027.          Moscow has denied accusations it was responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury but the incident plunged diplomatic relations between Russia and the West into the deep freeze. Army officers are pictured removing the bench where the Skripals collapsedMoscow has denied accusations it was responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals but the incident plunged diplomatic relations between Russia and the West into the deep freeze.The Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko previously suggested that Sergei and Yulia Skripal may have been injected by British authorities with nerve agent produced at Porton Down.However the UK has previously stated its conviction that only Russia had the means and motive to target the former spy.Karen Pierce, the UK\u0027s representative to the United Nations, told a meeting last month there was \u0027no plausible alternative explanation than Russian State responsibility for what happened in Salisbury\u0027, suggesting Russia had the ability, operation experience and motive to carry out the attack.          The UK has previously stated its conviction that only Russia had the means and motive to target the former spy.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

But scientists warned more vents would likely form and disgorge more lava.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea\u0027s summit.The University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses and a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, was closed because of the threat of sulfuric gas.Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes.

Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.The crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles  downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.Residents have faced lava threats before.In 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town\u0027s main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.From 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.Kilauea hasn\u0027t been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours\u0027 warning before it reaches their property.In the uncertainty, however, some residents found comfort in the abiding beauty of the Big Island.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point.

That ancient quince tree, whose fruit my mum turned into jam, is not only still alive, it has exploded into blossom!So the news last week that at least a million fewer people moved house between 2001 and 2011 compared with 1971 to 1981 is heartening. The change might be due to lack of social mobility and housing, or soaring stamp duty rather than not wanting to leave the location of your first kiss, but as someone who has moved house 14 times, that can only be a good thing.Like millions of baby-boomers I was seduced by TV shows such as Location, Location, Location (I actually hired Phil Spencer to find my farm in Somerset) and Grand Designs, and like many ambitious Londoners I thought moving to the country would be a breeze: just like staying in Babington House, but with no checkout time.But moving away from not just friends but the familiar – the florist that did your wedding and your mum’s funeral, the local art-house cinema where you snogged your future husband, even the basement kitchen where you found out he was cheating – is scary.Your past, like a tent caught in a gale, is ripped from its moorings, and disappears. Like many people, I moved house thinking, Ooh, once I’m there, in that dreamy location – I study new houses on Rightmove for hours, Google Earthing them, taking imaginary walks from the door and working out where my furniture will go – I will be happy.It never happens, because you take yourself with you.The most sorted person I know is my best friend.

But even in London – now, more than ever, a Labour city – the Corbyn revolution is the dog that refused to bark.The party I have worked for all my life catastrophically failed to win targets such as Barnet, where voters, at least in part, turned away from Labour in droves because of the anti-Semitism furore. Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhere. Election expert Professor Sir John Curtice pointed out there had actually been a swing to the Conservatives from Labour.Yet according to the leadership’s advance publicity, this was an election in which the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group was supposed to deliver grassroots campaigning and a seismic political breakthrough. How telling that one of Labour’s few success stories, in Plymouth, happened precisely because local activists insisted on running their own campaign and told Momentum to stay away.The lesson to be learned is simple and obvious: Corbyn’s project is leading the party away from victory.            Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhereLabour moderates have remained dutifully silent since he unexpectedly won more than 40 per cent of the vote in last year’s General Election. But it’s becoming clear that Theresa May was denied the mandate she sought for a whole host of reasons, not because Corbyn is some sort of modern prophet.Last June some voted for Labour safe in the belief that Corbyn would not be Prime Minister, others because they believed it was their best chance of avoiding a hard Brexit. There were, certainly, some true believers. But it has become increasingly clear that Jeremy’s leadership is going nowhere.Where, for example, is his vision? He could have cauterised the damaging anti-Semitism scandal by exposing it for what it was: the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader, and expelling those responsible. Instead he has fudged and prevaricated.His policy on the most pressing matter of the day, Brexit, is so vague that even the Shadow Ministers press-ganged to explain it on television and radio tie themselves in knots.And the parliamentary successes Labour has enjoyed in recent months have come because of the hard work and political nous of politicians the Corbynistas hatefully profess to despise as ‘Red Tories’ – backbencher David Lammy shaming the Government over Windrush Margaret Hodge forcing the Government into a U-turn on Commonwealth tax havens Yvette Cooper holding Amber Rudd’s feet to the fire over the ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, which resulted in her resignation. Keir Starmer and his team are the only reason Labour’s Brexit balancing act has lasted so long.We currently stand at a crossroads in British history, where if Tory hard-Brexit free marketeers have their way, workers’ protections could be shredded, countless jobs lost.This is precisely the moment where the Labour Party should be leading the national debate about our future, but all Corbyn and his acolyte John McDonnell have to offer are ideas that were promoted and rejected in the 1970s and 1980s. I’m not opposed to their ideas of social ownership of water and joint partnerships in rail. But these are not the policies of tomorrow. What does Corbyn’s Labour say to the millions who stand to lose their livelihoods to automation and outsourcing? How will it rejuvenate hollowed-out towns where shops are boarded up? What will it do about our deteriorating public spaces, where shared events and experiences should be enriching all our lives?What, after all, is the point of Labour as a party of principle if it doesn’t make a stand for the people it is elected to represent rather than peddle outmoded political dogma?I was part of a Labour ‘project’ that won three General Elections by appealing to people’s aspirations for a better future, not a return to the past. The lesson then, as now, is Labour can only be politically successful if it creates a clear agenda based on a positive alternative, rather than defining ourselves as being ‘anti’ everybody and everything.The parliamentary party – backbenchers, committee members and Select Committee chairmen – must pick up the cudgel and begin formulating ideas and policies. From among them, a leadership group must be formed from which a genuine alternative can emerge.It won’t be easy. I’ve seen the personal vitriol local activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from the likes of Unite’s Len McCluskey. I’ve seen how good Labour MPs are traduced and insulted, and admired the bravery of those who have been vilified for standing up to anti-Semitism.But it’s clear from the council election results that Corbynism is doomed to failure. Rebuilding a new, positive, Labour from the ground up is the only way forward. It’ll take time, which means there’s no time to lose.Whatever your views on Labour, our country and our democracy needs a proper, credible and electable alternative to challenge the Government. A renewed form of moderate New Labour needs to return.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/02/4BE615F300000578-0-image-m-19_1525568658997.jpg","title":"Photo series shows profiles men Tinder Bumble Happn sunsets backdrops","story":"The project explores human desire, self-perception, and the murky world of data-based love.In it, Middleton is asking the crucial question that bubbles under the surface of today\u0027s cyber-driven relationships: how much does a photo tell us? Who is this person, \u0027the swiped\u0027, who we see as nothing more than a beaming man with a setting sun?\u0027While using the widest search settings possible (on Tinder it was 100 miles max distance, age 18-55+, men) to browse through endless images of men, I noticed a formula for attraction, the most endearing trope of them all, the sunset,\u0027 Middleton told DailyMail.com.\u0027Each guy offered their own version of the same iconic sun. The relationship between the inidual, the sun, and how the two came together to attract the viewer, fascinated me. The project physicalized my overall feeling within today\u0027s culture of dating.\u0027Almost 50 million Americans have used online datings sites or apps, according to a recent survey by eHarmony.Of those, Pew Research found 66 per cent have gone on dates with people they met virtually - a huge leap up from 43 per cent in 2005.However, 33 per cent - approximately 16.5 million - go no further than swiping, messaging, and ultimately sidelining their matches.There are clear caveats. Even now that online dating is so ubiquitous and socially accepted, the chances of bagging a successful relationship remain slim - just 13 per cent of Tinder couples survive a month together.    For women, harassment is another deterrent to following through on a date: 57 per cent of women feel harassed online, including 39 per cent of Tinder users and 38 per cent of OkCupid users. But those factors aren\u0027t slowing down the industry\u0027s resounding boom which is rapidly transforming modern relationships.Taking stock of this dating revolution, Middleton was interested in the way the millions of singles used each app\u0027s strict visual format to sum themselves up.\u0027I\u0027m obsessed with the ways we represent ourselves to others,\u0027 Middleton explained.\u0027How do we curate the digital and physical world around us to represent a body others might desire? How do our choices create behaviors, both inidual and collective, that impact our everyday relations?\u0027Technological platforms, such as Tinder, Bumble, and Happn, offer a sensuality that lacks physicality. The desired body exists on the other end of a screen we touch. We feed ourselves the fantasy of partnering body in a warm sunset as we finger a flat surface and eat a bag of cheetos. Our body takes in an entirely separate reality from our mind and the disconnection causes a split of self.\u0027I believe this splitting has a micro affect on how we relate to each other in the physical world as the space for seeing and being seen has extended beyond our body\u0027s physicality and enabled new potentials for self-performance.\u0027I make work that questions this strange new relationship we have with ourselves and with others.\u0027  \u0027The video \u0027Guys with Sunsets\u0027 is the only interaction I have with these men,\u0027 Middleton said. \u0027It exemplifies the broken relationships we have with each other through our daily digital experiences.\u0027\u0027In the exhibition, a video is displayed in a small space that asks you to lie down and insert only your head. I wanted to cause a gesture that physically separates the head from the body, mentally taking you out of the world around you and into the one I have created for you.\u0027The installation emulates the experience of entering the connected world of our phones, while the sensations of our body in physical space pause and become a literal surface for those around us.\u0027The exhibition took place in the Tribeca neighborhood in Manhattan, New York, on March 24. In a choreography of images, set to Nina Simone\u0027s Either Way I Lose, Middleton playfully remarks on her personal feelings in the digital world of attraction.\u0027Searching for something real in an image-based system can be exhausting,\u0027 Middleton says.\u0027Mostly because our definition of real is continuously in flux.  People who visited the exhibition had to participate with the installation by laying down and sticking only their head in a small room (right) as the video played on loop  The installation (right) purposely detached participants from their body to emulate the artist\u0027s feeling of disconnection as she swiped for love with her body behind the confines of a screen\u0027As a member of this developing visual culture I find myself in a constant state of foreign and familiar. Both feelings happen simultaneously as I find difficulty in identifying the difference between the digital and physical worlds. \u0027The two worlds migrate closer to one another, within one another, on top of each other. Soon the sensation of difference will be gone and the rules of performance anew.\u0027Apps presented a new physicality of human desire. A longing funneled into a digital dating game. Their algorithms have presented a new data-based method for understanding relations and offer a distance between both the swiper and the swiped that turns another human into nothing more than an image of an idea.

There were lots of people who were, frankly, terrified of the Speaker.\u0027The former Black Rod accused Mr Bercow of making \u0027intolerable\u0027 personal insults and said the bullying claims risk bringing Parliament into disrepute.\u0027For Parliament not to investigate rigorously sets a poor example,\u0027 he said. \u0027This can no longer be simply swept under the carpet.\u0027He has spoken out strongly against the culture of bullying in Parliament, and this just seems to reek of hypocrisy.\u0027 John Bercow bullying allegations: Cabinet member to present evidence to watchdog | Politics | News | Express.co.uk‘Bully’ John Bercow reported to standards watchdog | News | The Sunday TimesTory MPs threaten to \u0027throw the kitchen sink\u0027 at John Bercow"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/09/4BE5883B00000578-5696311-image-a-14_1525594560616.jpg","title":"Nudists descend Paris museum gallery city","story":"    The Palais de Tokyo museum in Paris opened its doors for the first time to nudist visitors on Saturday - giving them special visiting hours to tour an exhibit in a one-off naturist event          The tour at the contemporary art museum was attended by around 160 visitors - and sold out in under two days.

For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.True, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’          The couple set off on the 4,000 mile trip on board the Hazana across the Pacific OceanA disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.

But scientists warned more vents would likely form and disgorge more lava.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea\u0027s summit.The University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses and a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, was closed because of the threat of sulfuric gas.Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes.

Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.The crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles  downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.Residents have faced lava threats before.In 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town\u0027s main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.From 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.Kilauea hasn\u0027t been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours\u0027 warning before it reaches their property.In the uncertainty, however, some residents found comfort in the abiding beauty of the Big Island.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

But even in London – now, more than ever, a Labour city – the Corbyn revolution is the dog that refused to bark.The party I have worked for all my life catastrophically failed to win targets such as Barnet, where voters, at least in part, turned away from Labour in droves because of the anti-Semitism furore. Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhere. Election expert Professor Sir John Curtice pointed out there had actually been a swing to the Conservatives from Labour.Yet according to the leadership’s advance publicity, this was an election in which the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group was supposed to deliver grassroots campaigning and a seismic political breakthrough. How telling that one of Labour’s few success stories, in Plymouth, happened precisely because local activists insisted on running their own campaign and told Momentum to stay away.The lesson to be learned is simple and obvious: Corbyn’s project is leading the party away from victory.            Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhereLabour moderates have remained dutifully silent since he unexpectedly won more than 40 per cent of the vote in last year’s General Election. But it’s becoming clear that Theresa May was denied the mandate she sought for a whole host of reasons, not because Corbyn is some sort of modern prophet.Last June some voted for Labour safe in the belief that Corbyn would not be Prime Minister, others because they believed it was their best chance of avoiding a hard Brexit. There were, certainly, some true believers. But it has become increasingly clear that Jeremy’s leadership is going nowhere.Where, for example, is his vision? He could have cauterised the damaging anti-Semitism scandal by exposing it for what it was: the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader, and expelling those responsible. Instead he has fudged and prevaricated.His policy on the most pressing matter of the day, Brexit, is so vague that even the Shadow Ministers press-ganged to explain it on television and radio tie themselves in knots.And the parliamentary successes Labour has enjoyed in recent months have come because of the hard work and political nous of politicians the Corbynistas hatefully profess to despise as ‘Red Tories’ – backbencher David Lammy shaming the Government over Windrush Margaret Hodge forcing the Government into a U-turn on Commonwealth tax havens Yvette Cooper holding Amber Rudd’s feet to the fire over the ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, which resulted in her resignation. Keir Starmer and his team are the only reason Labour’s Brexit balancing act has lasted so long.We currently stand at a crossroads in British history, where if Tory hard-Brexit free marketeers have their way, workers’ protections could be shredded, countless jobs lost.This is precisely the moment where the Labour Party should be leading the national debate about our future, but all Corbyn and his acolyte John McDonnell have to offer are ideas that were promoted and rejected in the 1970s and 1980s. I’m not opposed to their ideas of social ownership of water and joint partnerships in rail. But these are not the policies of tomorrow. What does Corbyn’s Labour say to the millions who stand to lose their livelihoods to automation and outsourcing? How will it rejuvenate hollowed-out towns where shops are boarded up? What will it do about our deteriorating public spaces, where shared events and experiences should be enriching all our lives?What, after all, is the point of Labour as a party of principle if it doesn’t make a stand for the people it is elected to represent rather than peddle outmoded political dogma?I was part of a Labour ‘project’ that won three General Elections by appealing to people’s aspirations for a better future, not a return to the past. The lesson then, as now, is Labour can only be politically successful if it creates a clear agenda based on a positive alternative, rather than defining ourselves as being ‘anti’ everybody and everything.The parliamentary party – backbenchers, committee members and Select Committee chairmen – must pick up the cudgel and begin formulating ideas and policies. From among them, a leadership group must be formed from which a genuine alternative can emerge.It won’t be easy. I’ve seen the personal vitriol local activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from the likes of Unite’s Len McCluskey. I’ve seen how good Labour MPs are traduced and insulted, and admired the bravery of those who have been vilified for standing up to anti-Semitism.But it’s clear from the council election results that Corbynism is doomed to failure. Rebuilding a new, positive, Labour from the ground up is the only way forward. It’ll take time, which means there’s no time to lose.Whatever your views on Labour, our country and our democracy needs a proper, credible and electable alternative to challenge the Government. A renewed form of moderate New Labour needs to return.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/12/04F7EBE8000003E8-5686649-image-a-2_1525346288011.jpg","title":"Cabinet minister hand evidence against ailing Speaker John Bercow","story":"    A Cabinet minister is prepared to give \u0027first hand\u0027 evidence against Commons Speaker John Bercow in any bullying probe, it was claimed today           David Leakey, the former Black Rod, drew the comparison between Weinstein\u0027s alleged sexual harassment and claims of Mr Bercow\u0027s bullying as he stepped up a campaigned against the Speaker  Mr Bercow has denied the allegations against him and it is unclear exactly how he can be investigated. The claims may be outside Ms Stone\u0027s remit and an independent inquiry into bullying in Parliament will not investigate and rule on specific cases.Mr Leakey told LBC Radio yesterday: \u0027\u0027John Bercow is not an altogether bad Speaker.

There were lots of people who were, frankly, terrified of the Speaker.\u0027The former Black Rod accused Mr Bercow of making \u0027intolerable\u0027 personal insults and said the bullying claims risk bringing Parliament into disrepute.\u0027For Parliament not to investigate rigorously sets a poor example,\u0027 he said. \u0027This can no longer be simply swept under the carpet.\u0027He has spoken out strongly against the culture of bullying in Parliament, and this just seems to reek of hypocrisy.\u0027 John Bercow bullying allegations: Cabinet member to present evidence to watchdog | Politics | News | Express.co.uk‘Bully’ John Bercow reported to standards watchdog | News | The Sunday TimesTory MPs threaten to \u0027throw the kitchen sink\u0027 at John Bercow"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/09/4BE5883B00000578-5696311-image-a-14_1525594560616.jpg","title":"Nudists descend Paris museum gallery city","story":"    The Palais de Tokyo museum in Paris opened its doors for the first time to nudist visitors on Saturday - giving them special visiting hours to tour an exhibit in a one-off naturist event          The tour at the contemporary art museum was attended by around 160 visitors - and sold out in under two days.

The project began in June 2017 in Grover’s church, where a parishioner invited him to see the clubs where he played “bones” or dominoes. “It was a revelation to me,” says Grover. “I had no idea that Caribbean migrants met three times a week for dominoes in Clapham, where I’ve lived for 30 years.”Intrigued, he began to visit domino clubhouses in Clapham, Croydon and Wandsworth. At first, people were wary of the stranger with a camera, but soon Grover was welcomed into homes, community centres, places of worship and even funerals.Grover discovered a much more important story waiting to be told: “I wanted to capture a Caribbean way of life that most likely won’t be around for ever.” He adds: “I feel so privileged to have been able to photograph the distinctive lives of this lovely community.”Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush at Tilbury in June 1948, the exhibition incorporates a number of interviews Grover conducted with Caribbean-born UK residents. “I knew I had to track down at least one surviving ‘Windrusher’ if I were to do justice to this story,” he says.His research took him to 92-year-old Alford Gardner in Leeds, who served in the RAF during the war as a motor mechanic. Having paid the standard £28 to cross the Atlantic on the Windrush, Gardner found work in Leeds with commercial engineers. Inevitably, as a Caribbean “room-seeker” back then he experienced racism (“Room to Let: Regret No Kolored”, ran the typical advert). Usually, though, there was no violence, as any aggressors fled once challenged. “I’ve lived a brilliant life here,” he told Grover. “It was supposed to be tough, but I never really had tough times.”In migrating here, the Windrush citizens believed they were exercising their birthright. “UK – Right of Abode” was stamped in their Commonwealth-issue passports. Teachers, lawyers, writers, artists and field labourers came in response to a recruitment drive and because they hoped for a better life. Not all of the Windrushers had intended to remain “in foreign”, but gradually it dawned on them that the dream of return was just that: they were here to stay. Curated by Katy Barron, the exhibition combines personal stories from first- and second-generation Caribbeans with a series of 12 themed photo-stories that, together, seek to describe the “totality” of their lives today. It explores the community, faith, love, death and friendship it looks at the lives of metalworkers, engineers, churchgoers and former NHS nurses.With his genial manner, Grover was granted access to photograph a Jamaican funeral and its Nine Night mortuary custom, where friends and relatives gather at the deceased’s house for food and drink. The tradition is fast disappearing among the young, but there is life in it yet. (As they say in Jamaica: “No call a man dead til you bury him.”)“Jamaican spirituality is such a beautiful thing,” says Grover, who wanted to capture Caribbean religious respect for a life well lived.His previous photographic exhibitions have documented a year in the life of a Clapham vicar, called Of Things Unseen, and the busy life of a neighbourhood, in last year’s 48 Hours on Clapham High Street. He shoots with a wide-angle lens: “That means getting in really close. At the Jamaican funeral I was literally standing at the grave’s edge. It required a good deal of trust.”For this project, Grover took photographs on 70 occasions. “In order to capture a dominoes match and its after-party, I sometimes had my camera out for long stretches – seven or eight hours. At other times, I just sat and listened to stories and watched life unfold in front of me.”The photographs are poignant and intimate. We see calypso-mento dancers in their “felts” (fedora hats) and domino hotshots banging down tiles. At crowded festive dance parties, or “bashments”, he photographed the elderly moving and flexing to jazz-tinged ska, rock-steady and reggae. The dapper Bockie, a regular at the Cosmo club in Wandsworth, told him: “Our generation… we’re rocking our bodies in our chairs.”Between 1948 and 1969, the formative years of the NHS, an estimated 5,000 Jamaican women came to the UK to work as nurses, while many others worked in different NHS roles. Monica Blair, one of Grover’s 12 photo subjects, arrived from Jamaica in 1964, aged 21, to marry Soney and worked as a cleaner at St Thomas’ hospital near Westminster, before becoming a seamstress. With her deep religious faith, Monica attends the same Anglican church in Clapham as Grover. In his photographs, she ministers communion wine and pores over a well-thumbed Bible, a gift to her as a teenager in Jamaica.By his own admission a “perfectionist” as a photographer, Grover scoured the south London streets in search of one of the famed “front rooms” and found one in Brixton. Once a part of every Jamaican home, front rooms typically contained framed family photographs, a picture of Jesus walking on water, sofas covered in protective plastic, leopardskin rugs and bouquets of artificial flowers. Often, a gold, plastic model of Big Ben or some other shooting-gallery prize graced a giant cocktail cabinet with a Formica top. The rooms are nearly all gone now. “They speak of a bygone era,” says Grover. “Sadly, to the second- and third-generations they’re just clutter.” Towards the end of his project, Grover was invited to photograph a Friday “open house” typical of Caribbean life. In the Brixton home of Hermine Grocia, as many as four generations gather each week for food, chat, a quiz or a game of Scrabble. “I wasn’t even sure I had space for it in the exhibition,” he says, “but I am so pleased to have spent the evening with Hermine and 21 of her family. It was so moving to see this wonderful family be so loving, relaxed and connected… they get together every Friday. It was the last thing I shot, and it ended the project for me on such a high.”Hermine met her future husband, Lester, on the Kingston wharf in 1959, just as they were about to sail for “Missus Queen’s” country. Like most of the Windrush generation, she had come to the UK determined to work. Grover’s moving and often beautiful photographs show the other side of the current Windrush scandal: they celebrate a community and a generation that contributed immeasurably to our cultural life.“The more I immersed myself in this project,” Grover says, “the more I realised that I was capturing living history. As this generation passes away, and the successive generations pursue their own lives here, some of these traditions will inevitably weaken. It felt imperative to document this way of life and to record these stories before it becomes too late.”Windrush: Portrait of a Generation is at gallery@Oxo, Oxo Tower Wharf, London SE1, 23 May-10 June.

The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David KellySeventy kilometres, three days, two canoes, one unforgettable adventure. The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David Kelly“A land bridge connected Minjerribah (Stradbroke Island) to Kombumerri country (Southport) and Goories also came in canoes to Minjerribah trading bunya for eugarie, amongst other things.” – History Life and Times of Robert Anderson, Gheebelum, Ngugi, MulgumpinReading this four years ago, I realised I knew nothing of the Indigenous history of my home on the Gold Coast – the land of the Saltwater people. I felt a responsibility to my young son to learn the story of the place we live, so that when he grew up I could teach it to him.But who was going to teach me? So I embarked on a voyage of discovery that carried me further than I ever expected, into a cultural story that is rarely offered to outsiders. What started as an attempt to educate myself became something far bigger – The Saltwater Story.Anderson’s account gave me an idea – why not make canoes and re-establish these ancient routes of connection? The Bundjalung, Yugambeh and Quandamooka were accomplished seafarers with complex maritime routes plied by bark and dugout canoe (gundal) – the former for short trips, the latter for longer voyages like the one described in Anderson’s book. The bark canoe in particular illustrates how to sustainably take what you need from your environment – the bark is removed but the tree remains alive and over time new bark grows. Very few still possess this knowledge – thanks to veteran paddler Mark Matthews I met Bundjalung canoemaker Kyle Slabb, who does. We quickly realised that this was more than just an opportunity for a whitefella to engage and educate himself – it was a chance to ensure cultural continuity in the next generation of Saltwater people. We decided to document the experience in a film, a book and an exhibit of David’s amazing photographs. As it happens, there was a suitable bark canoe tree in my backyard but the year was too dry to make a viable gundal. Nevertheless, Kyle’s demonstration of the crafting techniques to the younger generation was invaluable. We then made dugouts from hoop pine and paulownia the latter wood repels seawater, which prevents it from becoming waterlogged. Even when the temperature rose to 45 degrees, the young mob were interested in chipping in with (and away at) the canoe.We departed from the middle of Surfers Paradise on Australia Day weekend, surrounded by huge modern vessels and glittering towers. Maori, Dragonboaters and the general boating community joined us on the first leg in a wonderful flotilla – a celebration of all maritime histories in this country.Over the next three days and 70km through shark-infested waters we watched the young men grow into their roles, assume the mantle of leadership for the voyage. When we reached Dunwich (Goompi), a lot of the Quandamooka welcomed us. It was an emotional experience for many, especially as Robert Anderson himself, 88, was the elder who welcomed the paddlers … and with whom we exchanged bunya for eugarie. It had been 150 years since this journey had been made. There is talk now all along the Sea Eagle songline of canoe making, of connecting through the canoe over the saltwater again.So what will I tell my son? A story of connection – between the Saltwater people, between generations, between black and white, between land, sea and sky. A story of collaboration – whether it is made from bark or dugout, no one makes a canoe alone.A story of co-operation – paddlers working together to get to their destination, through rough seas and shark-infested waters.A story of continuance – of ancient knowledge held by just a few, of ensuring that tomorrow’s elders are brought along for the journey today. That is the Saltwater stories"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69baa5dba8ea25c414d186edfbbeb0d0c667bf40/0_191_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3c8021204c9322f0b575c8a6100ecc8","title":"interest rates stay low long time","story":"Bank of England governor Mark Carney has already faced accusations of behaving like the Grand old Duke of York and he will probably do so again should Britain’s central bank opt to keep interest rates on hold.Since he joined the Bank in 2013, he has marched borrowers and savers up the hill with heavy hints about the imminent prospect of a rate rise, only to march them back down again. Last November’s restoration of 2016’s emergency rate cut hardly qualified as a major move, whatever the Bank said about its\u0026nbspsignificance.And it wasn’t just Carney dropping hints. Almost every member of the committee who had previously blocked a rise had gone on the record arguing that the time for a rate increase was near at hand.Speeches by external member Jan Vlieghe constituted the most startling intervention. During 2016 and much of 2017, the former hedge fund economist turned interest-rate setter was one of the most vociferous opponents of a rise.His former brethren in the Square Mile considered him an arch dove who might never vote to increase rates, such was his downbeat view of the economy’s growth potential. Yet, towards the end of last year, he was one of the most optimistic proponents of the economy’s resilience and the likelihood of a rate rise.Just as before, a moment of central bank exuberance looks like becoming a non-event – which is strange given Vlieghe’s reasoning for backing an increase last year. Then, he said that ultra-low unemployment, steady growth and the probable end to a long period of declining real wages was enough to justify tighter monetary policy.There is no doubt that the prospect of wages outstripping inflation this year and next was a key element of Vlieghe’s and Carney’s argument.And it looked as if their resolve would be stiffened by a piece of the Bank’s own analysis that argued Brexit was having a bigger effect than previously thought.Surveys last week of the construction, manufacturing and services sector showed them all expanding, but at a snail’s pace.If Bank of England officials were truly dedicated to the cause of higher rates – if only to have something to cut in the event of a downturn – they would see through the spring dip and press ahead.So a reasonable conclusion must be that their hearts were never in the project – and that rates will stay low for a very long time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"against such a shambolic government labour should be doing better than this","story":"Stalemate is a result which a prime minister at midterm can live with. Tories have been left feeling more cheerful than they deserve to beOne way of assessing who has done best at a midterm election is by computing vote shares and measuring swings. If we do politics by calculator, then the local elections were pretty much a dead heat. Both Labour and the Tories enjoyed gains they could trumpet both suffered losses they’d prefer not to talk about. Like First World War armies, they have fired their shot and shell, only to end up in a trench warfare stalemate. Labour can pray in aid the projections that this result, translated into a general election, would make the party the largest in a hung parliament. Tories can retort that that’s worse than Ed Miliband managed when these council seats were contested in 2014. The projection then had him in Downing Street with a majority. So much for projections.If you want to know how the parties really feel about how they performed, forget the swings, the shares and the misleading extrapolations. Get out of the psephologists’ playground and use your ears to measure the frequency and quality of the excuses coming out of the spinners and spokespeople. In that regard, Labour has been on the back foot since the polls closed it is Jeremy Corbyn’s team that talks like the deflated party.In the early hours of Friday morning, at a time when all but political nerds have put themselves to bed, I watched Dawn Butler, a member of the shadow cabinet, trying to put a brave face on disappointment by saying: “We always knew it was going to be a difficult election.” This is normally the alibi you hear rolled out by a government minister explaining why midterm elections nearly always go badly for whoever is in power at Westminster. You do not anticipate hearing the defensive “always knew it was going to be a difficult election” excuse from a senior spokesperson for the principal party of opposition.Still less do you expect to hear it from the main challenger to the government, when the incumbents have fouled up so atrociously in the run-up to polling day and have been in office for a long and torrid stretch. The Conservatives are entering their ninth year in power. Economic growth is anaemic and many people are still not seeing real increases in their wages. Public services, especially many local services, have been pinched by the protracted grip of austerity. Mrs May has just lost another cabinet minister, the fourth forced departure from her top table in six months. From the national picture to the local one, from the shameful Windrush scandal to the record number of potholes breaking wheels and bones on the roads, the Tories went into these elections facing strong headwinds. They thought that they’d be the ones having to scrabble\u0026nbsparound for the excuses on election night. The Tories were on the ropes and flinching before an expected thumping by Labour that didn’t materialise. Some say that Labour has got the rough end of the stick in the post-election assessments because the party was poor at playing “the expectations game”. Anticipation of what could be achieved became overblown, with the consequence that a reasonable result would then be interpreted as failure.There may be some truth to this when we examine what happened in London. Labour had a result there that confirms its dominance in the capital, but it was not quite powerful enough to knock the Tories out of control in Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea, Wandsworth or Westminster. You can say that Labour lost the expectations game or you can be a bit less polite and observe that the party’s leadership and its admirers have been guilty of hubris. They went on about seizing the “Tory crown jewels” in the capital because they really thought there was a chance this was going to happen. They have so taken it for granted that Britain is inexorably embracing Corbynism that it has come as a bit of a shock to find that many voters still have the gravest reservations about giving their support to Labour even when the main alternative is Mrs May’s party.In some places, Labour was punished for specifics. The failure to deal with antisemitism in the party’s ranks clearly hurt the party and badly in Barnet, where it failed to win a part of north London it should have taken. Jeremy Corbyn’s broader problem is the same one he had at the election last year. Under him, the party does extremely well in large urban conurbations. One of Labour’s advances was to deprive the Tories of control in Trafford in Greater Manchester.Labour also has increased support by historic standards among more affluent professionals. It is one of life’s ironies that Mr Corbyn has made Labour a more middle-class party than Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson managed to do. We also know that Labour is popular among younger generations. It may be that Labour’s performance at the locals was somewhat suppressed compared with a general election because younger voters are less likely to turn out for council elections. Where Labour made insufficient progress at the general election, and continues to struggle, is beyond the big cities and university towns. The party is doing particularly badly among older and less affluent voters in provincial England. It underperformed in areas such as Basildon, Bolton, Derby, Dudley, Nuneaton, Swindon and Walsall. These are places with key parliamentary constituencies where the opposition has to be winning well at this stage of the electoral cycle to look credible as a government-in-waiting.One Labour alibi for this is to blame the implosion of Ukip, which has become the “Black Death” party in the estimation of its own general secretary. For every three former Ukip voters, two went to the Conservatives and just one to Labour. It seems to me that Labour has been a bit too ready to accept this as inevitable, rather than to ask itself why it can’t appeal to more of these voters. That boosted the Conservatives as they enjoyed the bigger helping from the carrion of Ukip. But this feast contains a poison pill. Because a large chunk of Tory support was provided by Leave voters, the hard Brexiters have been emboldened to clamour for more concessions to their demands. The price of catering to that constituency is that it will further alienate the Tories from the younger and more liberal voters that they will need to attract if they are ever to assemble a decent parliamentary majority.Forward-thinking Tories will also be worried that the Lib Dems are flickering back to life. The gains made by Vince Cable’s party will lift morale and encourage them to think they can rebuild the traditional base in local government that was devastated during the coalition years. As importantly, the evisceration of Ukip re-establishes the Lib Dems as the third party in England, which ought to give a boost to their presence in the media. They will be helped by voters being reminded of their existence more regularly. Experience suggests that a Lib-Dem revival will hurt the Conservatives in parliamentary contests more than it damages Labour. That is for the future. Theresa May, a prime minister who measures success by whether she gets to the end of the week, is simply glad that she avoided a Tory meltdown. For her, survival is a kind of triumph.Local elections are a highly imperfect guide to general election success or failure, the more so when the next national contest could be as much as four years away. That said, we should not make the opposite mistake of pronouncing that they are entirely meaningless. The voters are always telling us something about the present and a bit about the future when they cast a ballot. On these results, there is no clear path to a parliamentary majority for either of the big parties. The Labour MP Jess Phillips got it right when she drolly observed: “I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.”Failure is always relative in politics. Stalemate is a result that a government at midterm can live with. Tories have been left feeling more cheerful than they deserve to be and more optimistic about their prospects than they have been for a while. A draw is not good enough for the main opposition party. “We should have romped home,” remarks one senior Labour MP. More of them would be saying that publicly if they did not feel intimidated into silence. Against a shambolic and ided government presiding over a weak economy, Labour has not put in the level of performance necessary to make it look like an opposition party striding confidently towards national victory.Deep down, at least some of Labour’s leadership know this. Just listen to the excuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6bcd2e1d83535d0974c1560e36f3bcd6371997/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf4433fd69131d2a60cbb46c86d1d9b","title":"even when the likes of macron foul up multilingual politicians get it right","story":"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, never ceases to surprise his audience, especially when he speaks in English. While some of his compatriots were shocked that he should address the US Congress in its native tongue, it pleased a large number of French people who appreciated how he engaged directly in version originale.A few days later, however, when President Macron thanked the Australian prime minister’s wife, Lucy Turnbull, for being “delicious” – conjuring up images of cannibalism and Hannibal Lecter – some commentators suddenly thought of Macron as creepy. It was hours before somebody thought to tell the Australians that the word “délicieuse” actually means delightful.Speaking a foreign language is a minefield for anyone who ventures there but also a source of constant wonder, joy and fun. The rewards are manifold and it is even thought to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.The smartest leaders either know many languages or understand the power of words enough to play with them to their advantage. Perhaps Macron used the word “delicious” on\u0026nbsppurpose perhaps, even, the secret behind the strangely warm rapport between Macron, Trump and their wives is built on such deliciously faux amis?The fact is that multilinguists rule the world. That Angela Merkel is trilingual (she speaks German, Russian and English) should be no surprise. If David Cameron had not been a monoglot, maybe Britain would not have found itself in a Brexit nightmare. Just a thought.I will always remember when Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, on a visit to Paris in 1989 declared in French on French television that the PLO’s charter was “caduque!” What a stroke of genius. The world reached for their French dictionaries and discovered Arafat had just buried the 1964 Palestinian charter (since “caduque” means out of date), which had so far insisted that armed struggle was the only possible way to win back the homeland. This tiny word paved the way to the Oslo accords of 1993 and the famous handshake between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin in Washington.In 1940, Parisians owed a big favour to Louisa Gross née Horwitz, the mother of the then American ambassador to Paris, William Christian Bullitt Jr. A German Jew, she made sure that her son was perfectly trilingual, as fluent in German and French as in American English. When the French government fled Paris, in effect making Bullitt the provisional governor of the city, there were only a few hours left to save the city from the fate shared by Rotterdam and Warsaw. Bullitt managed to persuade two French officials to meet their German counterparts at Écouen, 12 miles north of Paris, to settle terms for the handover. With the document signed, the German Field Marshal Georg von Küchler called off the bombardment of Paris.In everyday life, multilingualism and potential linguistic gaffes don’t carry such catastrophic potency, and faux amis leading to faux pas are part of the learning process. When I first arrived in Britain, aged 22, I found out that, more often than not, French words in the English language don’t actually mean a thing. I recall an awkward evening when an Englishman whispered some slightly salacious things to me. He winked and apologised for the “double entendre”. Double entendre? It took me some time to realise he meant “sous-entendre” – meaning implication.It is, however, always better to make small mistakes like Macron did in Australia than to rely on poor translators. The writer Oliver Kamm, the son of one of the greatest living British translators Anthea Bell, reminded me this week that in 1977, the translator Steven Seymour, accompanying Jimmy Carter on an official state visit to Poland, had to be fired after a disastrous first evening. President Carter had begun his speech saying: “I have come to learn your opinions and understand your desires for the future.” His translator told the Poles, in Polish: “I\u0026nbsphave a carnal desire for Poland.”• Agnès Poirier is the author of Left Bank, Arts, Passion and the Rebirth of Paris 1940-1950"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/994987035c7426025dc4392f5f1e5761e260419a/0_0_2237_2237/master/2237.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f29c9d134b2e79b86c6dfbffdfab5ea9","title":"nick offerman interview parks and recreation","story":"Best known for his role in the US sitcom, the actor talks about his love of tools, being a Londonphile, and his proposal to Megan MullallyNick Offerman is best known for his portrayal of libertarian local government worker Ron Swanson in the US sitcom Parks and Recreation. He also runs the carpentry collective Offerman Woodshop and has written the foreword for a new manual The Tool Book. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, comic actor Megan Mullally, best known for starring in Will \u0026amp Grace, and their two rescue dogs.How did you come to be writing the foreword for a book about tools?Word had gotten out that I know how to use a shovel. When they asked me to do it, I leapt at the chance. The publishers sent me an early draft and I felt like a kid in a candy store. All these magical implements.When did your love of tools begin?My mom’s family ran a pig farm in rural Illinois, where they also grew corn and soya beans. There was a touch of Little House on the Prairie. My earliest memories are of my dad splitting firewood. As soon as we could swing an axe, he’d have me and my siblings out there. It was a carnival of tool use – gardening, repairing barns, maintaining machinery. I always looked up to my two uncles, who reminded me of Han Solo. They might not have had the newest, flashiest spaceship, but with their acumen and tools, they kept their particular Millennium Falcons running in top shape.Do you give your tools names?Not as a rule, although there are certain hammers and crowbars that I might call “the Persuader”. And there’s a newish tool called a powder-actuated nailgun which I’ve nicknamed “Boom Boom”.Do you think tools are back in fashion?I’m excited that we’re reawakening to our own handiness. It’s charismatic to be self-sufficient, to be able to mend our own bicycles. For decades, we’ve been taught to be sheep-like consumers. “The handle’s fallen off the toaster. Let’s throw it away and get a new one.” That’s not frugal living nor respectful of the planet’s resources. Using tools makes you a good citizen.You’re soon co-hosting a new NBC show with Amy Poehler. Tell us about it.It’s a crafting contest called Making It, starting in July. Crafters of all different disciplines compete in challenges to make things, while Amy and I clown around, tossing out as many painful puns as we can muster. I’m thrilled with . It’s good-hearted and optimistic, the sort of medicine the world could use right now. After you’ve spent the day shaking your fist at your Twitter feed or grinding your teeth at the political situation, you can switch on Making It. The comfort food of television.Sounds a bit like The Great British Bake Off…Funnily enough, that was one of our influences. The Bake Off’s warmth, camaraderie and joy in creativity was really inspiring to us.Amy Poehler was one of your Parks and Recreation co-stars. Do you stay in touch with the others?The whole cast just got together for a reunion dinner, which was wonderful. We still have a group text thread, which started when we were shooting and has never stopped. It’s like a great sports team or your college years, whatever your glory days were. In some ways, you’ll always miss it, but with maturity, you realise it can’t last for ever. We’re grateful we got to experience it for seven years but it came to a natural end and wrapped up at the right time.Devoted carnivore Ron Swanson became a hero for meat lovers. Do people assume that’s the real you?There are several areas in which people conflate me with Ron’s cartoon physicality. Sometimes in a restaurant, if the chef is a fan and hears I’m dining, they’ll add an inch-thick layer of bacon or send over an extra steak. At first, it was amazing. Who doesn’t love free meat? But my cardiologist pointed out that a real digestive system can’t eat like that. Or indeed drink scotch in Ron’s quantities and hope to lead a productive life.You’ve slimmed down in recent years anyway, right?I have. My Parks and Rec boss asked me to “stay beefy”, which is one of the best things you can hear from your employer. But as the show ended, the parts coming my way fell into a similar trope: “An ex-sportsman, 30lb past his prime, standing in his briefs, crying in the mirror.” I decided I’d like to live as long as possible and get a wider variety of roles, so I cleaned up my diet and trimmed down. Maybe now I’ll be cast as a thinner version of that depressed, gone-to-seed sportsman.Do you miss Ron’s trademark moustache?I love having a healthy faceful of whiskers. Facial hair is a boon for a character actor. In any given year, I can sport a full prospector’s beard, all the way down to clean-shaven. It’s another tool in my thespianic toolbox, as it were.You’re quite a Londonphile, aren’t you?London is our favourite city on the planet. Much like Fortnum \u0026amp Mason’s Beef Extract spread, it’s simply moreish.

Magically, the ducks on the water and birds in the air began to furiously copulate all around us. Something made the moment bigger than the two of us. It was fated by Mother Nature.Haven’t you and Megan co-written a marriage guide too?It’s called The Greatest Love Story Ever Told, out this fall. It’s a sincere memoir of our romance, but, as always, shot through with humour and lots of filthy references to what we do in the bedroom. Eighteen years into the relationship, I’m constantly grateful she continues tolerating me. When I wake up and look over at her, I still think: “You lucky bastard, you better be on your best behaviour today.”What else is in the pipeline?I have a film coming out in June called Hearts Beat Loud. It has a crackerjack cast and it’s the beautiful, touching, funny story of me and my daughter’s little rock band in Brooklyn. I’m proud of it.

On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912.

It is this latter quality, initially seen by many as a good thing, that has become an acute concern for safety campaigners, who fear that the rising number of electric vehicles constitutes a silent menace.When they travel at under 20mph the vehicles can barely be heard, especially by cyclists or pedestrians listening to music through headphones. “The greatest risks associated with electric vehicles are when they are travelling at low speeds, such as in urban areas with lower limits, as the noise from tyres and the road surface, and aerodynamic noise, are minimal at those speeds,” said Kevin Clinton, from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.But the days of silence are numbered. From July next year, all new electric and hybrid vehicles sold in Europe will have to emit a noise when travelling at low speeds. All existing ones will have to be retrofitted with a device by 2021.The law has been welcomed by campaigners. James White, at the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, is worried about the risk the cars pose to people with sight loss. He said that for people who struggle to see them, the vehicles should indicate their presence in other ways.In Japan there was a national outcry when a guide dog and its owner were killed by a reversing electric vehicle whose driver had used a pause control to deactivate its sound emitter. The new standards, which in Europe will be introduced via an EU directive, will bar their use.About 140,000 electric vehicles are now registered in Britain compared with just 3,500 in 2013. By 2030 the National Grid predicts there could be as many as 9 million electric vehicles on Britain’s roads.Chris Hanson-Abbott, whose firm Brigade Electronics is a distributor of vehicle safety products, is an adviser to the UN working group on quiet road transport vehicles that came up with the industry standards now being introduced across the world as electric cars become mainstream. “The object is to have warnings which are audible but which are not the least bit environmentally disturbing,” said Hanson-Abbott, who introduced the reversing alarm to the UK in 1976.Battles have raged over what sort of sound the vehicles should emit and when they should emit it, Hanson-Abbott said. The agreed standard is a mix of tonal sounds, or white noise, that will cut out once the vehicle gets to about 20mph and the sound of the tyres becomes sufficiently audible. “White sound is very pleasant. It’s the sound of falling water,” Hanson-Abbott said. “It has two unique characteristics. One is that it’s very pleasant on the ear and the second is that the source direction of that sound is instantly recognisable. The moment you hear white sound you can point directly at where it’s coming from. This is an incredibly valuable quality.”In contrast, “tonal” sound emitted by diesel or petrol cars can bounce off hard surfaces, making it difficult to judge its source. “It’s a huge improvement on the noise emitted by petrol or diesel vehicles because its sound source is directional,” Hanson-Abbott said. “That’s a massive safety factor.”Politicians promoting electric cars as the future of urban transportation have welcomed the move to make the vehicles noisier.“It’s something manufacturers are already looking into and we understand from previous tests that the main risk is lower-speed driving – such as reversing when manoeuvring around a car park – when the car is most quiet,” said Sally Longford, who is in charge of neighbourhood services and local transport at Nottingham city council. It wants to support the use of 8,000 more electric vehicles in the city by 2020.“We are fully supportive of calls for manufacturers to look at how this can be addressed to ensure the increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads doesn’t create an unnecessary risk to pedestrians and other road users,” she added.Number of electric cars in UK, up from 3,500 in 2013.Predicted number of electric cars on UK roads by 2030.Date all electric cars in EU must fit a noise emitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d1ebc99fa0eebca93e813c70e372bbed6766ed/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1151eff6e6dc8953792193dfa402650","title":"lean on pete review andrew haigh modern american odyssey charlie plummer","story":"British director Andrew Haigh’s modern American odyssey sees Charlie Plummer excel as a teen fleeing grim realitiesA performance of remarkable depth, candour and vulnerability by rising star Charlie Plummer lies at the heart of this terrifically moving fourth feature film from British writer-director Andrew Haigh. Adapted from the 2010 novel by Willy Vlautin, Lean on Pete blends timeless American myths with pin-point portrayals of modern urban hardship, as its lonely teenage lead heads east from Oregon with a horse on its last hurrah. The travails are tough but there’s an unsentimental tenderness at the centre of Haigh’s movie – a melancholic counterpoint to the grim realities of life from which our young hero flees.Plummer plays Charley Thompson, a lanky 15-year-old (he lies about his age) who has moved home umpteen times with his single father, Ray (Travis Fimmel). With dreams of playing for the high-school football team blighted by a nomadic lifestyle, Charley has become a loner who has learned to fend for himself. Running past the Portland Meadows racetrack, he meets Steve Buscemi’s trainer, Del Montgomery, who offers him a few bucks to change a tyre and help with his horses. “Never let go of the rope,” Del tells Charley an instruction that seems to double as a diehard life lesson.A diffident yet attentive presence, Charley has a trusting nature and finds a kindred spirit in the eponymous quarter horse, a former short-sprint winner (“Don’t blink or you’ll miss it”). The endearingly named Lean on Pete is showing signs of age, and Del is getting ready to send him, euphemistically, “to Mexico”. “You can’t get attached to a horse,” says Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), a jockey who has suffered her fair share of injuries, and who observes tellingly that “there’s only so many times you can fall down, right?” But when all hope seems lost, Charlie hits the trail with his one true friend, heading for Wyoming and searching for somewhere to call home.Vlautin’s novel has been described by critics as a distant descendant of Walter Farley’s The Black Stallion, with shades of Salinger and Steinbeck. There is a quote from the latter at the start of the novel that Haigh has clearly taken to heart. “It is true that we are weak and sick and ugly and quarrelsome,” Steinbeck wrote, “but if that is all we ever were, we would millenniums ago have disappeared from the face of the Earth.” Haigh paints sympathetic portraits of all the characters the good, the bad and the ugly. Ray may not be an ideal father, but there’s a tangible tenderness in the scenes with his son, and a sense of closeness that persists even during his frequent absences. Del is a world-weary chancer who dopes, exploits and then dumps his horses, yet there’s a gruff paternal affection in his advice to Charley to “do something else before there’s nothing else you can do”. Even Steve Zahn’s drunken drifter Silver has a child-like quality that is counterposed with a violent tinderbox temper.After the tight focus of Weekend and 45 Years (which the director described as “companion piece” pictures), Haigh widens his canvas as Charley heads into the desert, embarking upon an American odyssey to which Danish cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof Jønck responds with lyrical grandeur. While the narrative may be read as a coming-of-age story, there’s something more elemental in Charley’s search for a beloved aunt, who comes to represent his idealised yearning for a lost family life. Crucially, Charley remains at the centre of the picture, with the oblong 1.85 frame lending a human dimension to these expansive vistas, ensuring that we don’t get distracted by the scenery, or lose sight of the true focus of the story.Unsurprisingly, Lean on Pete is a film in which gestures are more important than words. Having declared in passing that “You won’t see me again in California”, Del shoots Charley a glance that speaks volumes about his shady past. As for Charley, he may have been schooled in Sam Shepard-style manly “truths” (“The best women have all been waitresses at some point,” Ray tells him between beers), but his voice has a lilting softness, which matches the expressiveness of his face. At times, there’s a touch of James Dean in Plummer’s plaintive delivery, along with echoes of Jon Voight’s marooned hustler in Midnight Cowboy. Having made a splash in Felix Thompson’s 2015 indie-pic King Jack, Plummer has proved a mercurial presence in films as erse as Oren Moverman’s The Dinner andmore recently Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World. In Lean on Pete, this rising star proves his mettle in a role for which he is simply perfect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e26312de5796b74321ace09adb5e3ed8df31679/0_146_4448_2669/master/4448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d363e4f40cc78c6738e536fcc95eb155","title":"les herbiers coupe de france final psg","story":"Singularity has always been ingrained in the Coupe de France and this season is no exception. The centenary final, to be held on Tuesday, pits Paris Saint-Germain against Les Herbiers, who hail from a small town in western France of 16,000 people and have an average attendance of 1,400.In financial terms, too, there is no contest: PSG’s budget is 275 times that of Les Herbiers (around £1.7m), who turned professional only three years ago and play in the third tier of French football, where they sit just above the relegation zone. Their squad, mostly made up of free transfers and a few loanees (with three players having briefly experienced Ligue 1), has cost nothing to assemble and the average monthly wage is £2,200.But one secret weapon the rich Parisians may envy the club from the Vendée region for is their No 1 supporter Philippe Katerine, a local who is France’s most eccentric singer, thanks notably to his madcap hit Louxor J’adore, the offbeat clip of which was shot in a village near Les Herbiers. The humorous provocateur, famed for his surrealist and irreverent lyrics, has released a trademark unconventional cup final anthem, an odd call to arms titled 85 rouge et noir.In the semi-final, the Vendéens eliminated another small third-tier club, Chambly, who have racked up 11 promotions since their inception in 1989 in the 14th ision, a feat achieved without benefiting from the largesse of a wealthy benefactor. Chambly, modelled on a defensive Internazionale by the French-Italian Luzi family which has run the club for the last three decades, had dispatched Ligue 1 Strasbourg in the quarter-finals but were no match for Les Herbiers’s all-attacking style. Sadly, the founder of the club, Walter Luzi, died on the day of the semi-final, played at Nantes’s La Beaujoire stadium in front of a capacity crowd of 35,000. Last season in the last 32, Chambly had held Monaco to a pulsating 3-3 draw in normal time before losing 5-4 in extra timeAlthough no team below the second tier have won the trophy (second ision Le Havre and Guingamp achieved this in 1959 and 2009, respectively), giantkillers – les tombeurs de gros – such as Chambly hold a special place in Coupe de France lore. Calais shot to national prominence in 2000 when, as a fourth ision side, they reached the final. “Calaismania” swept the country and they lost 2-1 to Nantes only because of a dubious stoppage-time penalty.Similar exploits are fairly commonplace in the Coupe. The first petit poucet (minnows) were arguably the Algerian amateurs of El Biar who, in 1957, knocked out two second-tier clubs before defeating Reims, the European Cup runners-up the year before, 2-0 in the last 32. In 1996 and 2001 third ision Nîmes and Amiens toppled five top-flight clubs between them on their way to the final. In 2012 third ision Quevilly battled to the final, where they fell 1-0 to Lyon after putting out Ligue 1 Marseille and Rennes. Quevilly are no strangers to “cupsets”: most notably, in 1927, they lost to Marseille in the final.Over the past five years alone 15 amateur or semi-professional clubs (fourth ision and below) have reached the last 16. The difference in level between the top three isions and the rest is relatively small in France and the gradual introduction of a series of rules designed to protect teams in the lower leagues, such as home advantage, perhaps explains the phenomenon. The absence of replays also favours underdogs who, over time, have grown in confidence.French cinema consecrated plucky minnows in the 1979 box-office hit Coup de Tête, a satirical comedy centred around the fictitious AS Trincamp. The film was inspired by the rise of Auxerre and Guingamp’s heroic cup feats of 1973 when the then fifth ision team beat four second ision clubs. Guingamp used the cup proceeds (£90,000) to mount several promotion campaigns that took them to the top flight in 1995, where they have largely remained, an astonishing achievement for a town the size of Totnes.The Coupe de France was founded in 1917 on the initiative of Henri Delaunay, chairman of the forerunner of the French Football Federation, who was impressed by the vibrancy of the FA Cup. Delaunay felt the Coupe could play a unifying role in a country torn asunder by the first world war and decreed that it should be open to all French clubs, irrespective of level. More than 8,000 teams enter each year, including hundreds in the French overseas territories, and the tournament kicks off with regional rounds some 13 months before the final in May the following year, making it the most inclusive and largest domestic competition in world football.The 11 best overseas clubs – les ultramarins – enter at the seventh round in November (there are 14 rounds 15 in the larger regions) along with Ligue 2 clubs. The FFF covers expenses for clubs drawn to play in mainland France or overseas. As round-trip distances can exceed 20,000 miles, clubs usually make a mini holiday of it.However, for the first time in four years no ultramarin got past the preliminary rounds and, although this may be a blip, it could also reflect the parlous financial state of French overseas football. Many clubs are in effect bankrupt and the FFF is increasingly having to bail out local leagues as they struggle to retain promising players keen to relocate to mainland France for football or professional reasons.Exceptionally, for various reasons, the final will be played on a Tuesday – a bank holiday. That may take a few fans by surprise but this mismatch between PSG and Vendée Les Herbiers is unlikely to deter lovers of the rebellious and unpredictable spirit of the Coupe de France: the most watched Coupe final of the past decade is Lyon v third-tier Quevilly in 2012 with nearly seven million viewers, twice as many as last year’s final between PSG and Angers.Kevin Quigagne is a former football writer for Les Cahiers du football"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e27372d67218c742060199eb84e5339b025ca84/253_20_2931_1759/master/2931.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=172265d91d4ca0cdd497a47146b58e82","title":"carlo ancelotti arsenal manager","story":"Apparently, Arsène Wenger does not want too much fuss. Wenger has not even held a press conference before what Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal’s chief executive, promised a couple of weeks ago would be a “send-off the world will take notice of”. Somehow, I wonder whether Gazidis was getting a little carried away. Arsenal have not even decided yet if they want a statue of Wenger when, frankly, one should have been announced on the day the abdication was announced. They will give away 60,000 “Merci Arsène” T-shirts but nobody should\u0026nbspexpect a helicopter to whizz Wenger away, à la Kevin Keegan at Newcastle in 1984, or the crowd to genuflect in his direction. Wenger, sad as it is, just doesn’t inspire that kind of worship. Not any more,\u0026nbspanyway.If that sounds a little downbeat on the day he says adieu to the Emirates, perhaps it is a legacy of being there for the game against West Ham, two days after the news that Wenger was being cut free, and the unshakeable feeling on that occasion that it was not going to be an easy separation. Arsenal’s supporters did not have the energy for a love-in and, overall, it was a rather sad business. It was blandness the crowd feared the most, not saying goodbye. Anyone\u0026nbspexpecting to see petals thrown at Wenger’s feet was badly\u0026nbspmistaken.Today should be a more poignant\u0026nbspoccasion, with the great and good of the Wenger era added to the guest list for the game against Burnley, a guard of honour and all sorts of choreographed tributes. Equally, it already feels like a long, complicated goodbye and, unfortunately for Wenger, nothing can sugarcoat the fact that his final\u0026nbspseason at Arsenal has been a dismal one, or that Gazidis should\u0026nbspnow think very carefully about his strategy for choosing the next man.First and foremost, presumably Arsenal are aware that a man who has won the Champions League on three different occasions is available? Do they recall that the man in question, Carlo Ancelotti, won the Premier League and FA Cup Double in his first season in English football? Have they been made aware that he is eager, to say the least, to return to the industry in which his collection of trophies and inidual awards could fill an aircraft hangar?The questions feel relevant because it seems strange to me that Ancelotti – at 58, 10 years younger than Wenger – is not attracting more attention. Have Arsenal checked his CV recently? And, if so, are they really in any position to pass up someone of the Italian’s class and achievement?At least if they prefer Luis Enrique’s credentials a reasonable argument can be made that they have chosen somebody else who knows what it takes to win at the highest level. It was Pep Guardiola who made Barcelona great. Yet Luis Enrique made them even better in that season, 2014-15, when he won the treble with a front line of Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar. His record is not so hot elsewhere but it should be obvious why he is occupying Arsenal’s\u0026nbspthoughts.At the same time, Ancelotti has outdone Guardiola, Sir Alex Ferguson, José Mourinho, Ottmar Hitzfeld, Arrigo Sacchi and everybody bar Bob Paisley when it comes to European Cup triumphs. He has won major trophies in England, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, including league championships in four of those countries. He lives in London, as well as having properties in Milan and Vancouver. His Canadian wife, Mariann, is another Londonphile and the fact his last spell of work in England ended with the sack probably says more about Chelsea than it does him.Just consider the story Ancelotti tells of being summoned to Roman Abramovich’s house after a game against West Brom to be informed that the performance was not good enough. It was the first day of the new season and, in fairness to Ancelotti, Chelsea had just won the first Premier League and FA Cup Double of their history. Yet Abramovich wasn’t happy and Ancelotti was given a dressing‑down. Chelsea, for the record, had won 6-0.Ancelotti was fired at the end of that season for the heinous crime of finishing second and, against that kind of backdrop, it comes as a slight surprise to learn he would be tempted to put his head back in the noose and work for Abramovich again if, as is widely assumed, Antonio Conte leaves Stamford Bridge. Arsenal, in other words, might need to get their skates on.For the time being, however, it isn’t easy to know if they find the idea particularly attractive and, judging by some of the reports coming out of the Emirates, it may be that they will prefer to go in another direction anyway. Arsenal, we are told, are exploring a range of “younger head coach-style options” and want to be bold in their thinking, as they were in 1996 with the man London’s Evening Standard famously introduced as “Arsène\u0026nbspWho?”Fair enough, in an ideal world. But is this really a job for someone at the start of their managerial career? Wenger does not just run the first team at Arsenal, he has an input in everything, right down to choosing the boutonnières for Wembley appearances and arranging the staff’s fuel cards. Whoever replaces him will be inheriting a club about to finish with the fewest points of his 22 years in charge, as well as their lowest league position, and having just posted their worst sequence of away results since 1966. This is a big, scary job. It needs someone with the kind of bone‑deep composure that is born to only a few men and, if Arsenal want to be bold, surely it makes sense to go for the candidate with the superior credentials.It is certainly perplexing that Mikel Arteta, for instance, is being\u0026nbspmentioned more prominently, other than the fact English football is always a sucker for a sentimental choice. Arteta once played for Arsenal and now has a background role at Manchester City (though it’s Guardiola who takes the coaching). Is that really enough to take the leap into managing a club of Arsenal’s size? Would his name even be on the betting-shop chalkboards if he didn’t have an Arsenal past?Similar questions can be applied to Patrick Vieira. The link with Zeljko Buvac, Liverpool’s estranged coach, is another bewildering one and Mourinho even popped up in the last few days to give oxygen to the view that his assistant, Rui Faria, might be a serious candidate, calling his assistant “a good fit”. Well, it’s an idea. But seriously, can an argument be made that any of these have a superior case than a man with Ancelotti’s durable\u0026nbspcompetence?The only argument I have heard against Ancelotti is that he prefers to inherit a ready‑made team rather than one needing restoration work. Well, which manager doesn’t? In truth, Ancelotti has improved virtually all his teams, starting with Reggiana’s promotion and Parma’s highest-ever Serie A finish even before the years when he built his reputation as a trophy\u0026nbspmachine.He is not the only candidate with impressive credentials – Massimiliano Allegri and Conte, to name but two, would surely have the coaching knowhow to improve the late-Wenger Arsenal – and nobody is asking Gazidis to operate with a closed mind if he is absolutely convinced that, say, Julian Nagelsmann, the 30-year‑old manager of Hoffenheim, is the outstanding option.Alternatively, Arsenal cannot afford to get this one wrong. It would set them back years and that would feel even more reckless if, in the process, they have passed up someone who has already demonstrated, over nearly a quarter of a century, that he is the real deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2bc9ed4d450c6aec96dfa929f4e4a7f1bcfb3dd/0_157_2753_1651/master/2753.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d808087fedbe62bfb8bdd93b292aa0","title":"azzedine alaia design museum couturier darling designer","story":"A stunning show at the Design Museum presents the master couturier’s own vision – although sadly he won’t see itWhen Azzedine Alaïa, the Tunisian master couturier, died of a heart attack in Paris last November, aged 82, the Design Museum in London was seven months into preparing a big show dedicated to his work. It was to be the first fashion exhibition in the museum’s new building in Kensington and the choice of Alaïa had been carefully made. “The museum has very special architecture,” says Alice Black, co-director. “What Azzedine Alaïa created over his career is also striking sculpture. We felt that his work against the backdrop of the museum would be amazing.”Black had come to know the tiny and charismatic designer over the previous few months. The team had been working closely with Alaïa himself, a man known for his perfectionism and hands-on approach. “Azzedine was the heart and soul of his label. For a while I wondered if the exhibition could still go ahead,” says Black. “But because he had really wanted it, everyone took it on themselves to make it happen. It was his concept, his idea, so we hadn’t been left to second guess.”Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier, curated by Alaïa’s long-term collaborator and friend, Mark Wilson of the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands, opens this Thursday. The museum has resisted the temptation to turn it into a retrospective and has stayed with the designer’s original vision for it to be a study of technique and craft, with more than 60 examples of couture pieces. It is the first-ever UK show dedicated to Alaïa, who is less well known here than in his adopted France. But those who know fashion revere Alaïa almost like no other. The industry loves a secret and there has been a cult surrounding Alaïa for five decades, inspired not only by his unique – although much-imitated – style but by his desire for perfectionism (a dress could take five weeks or five years), his refusal to be dictated to by commercialism and his personal style of business, largely conducted in his atelier-cum-apartment in the Marais around a kitchen table, where Alaïa served guests with his own cuisine.The Alaïa aesthetic is so powerful that, to those who know it, merely uttering the name will summon up a vision – a living, breathing woman, her form enhanced by fabrics that sculpt and mould, clinch and cling. “He’s the master of cut and fit, a sculptor, ” says Wilson. “He didn’t do drawings that somebody else translated. He designed everything directly on to the body. That’s how he made things.” In both his couture and ready-to-wear collections his materials were Lycra bandages, smooth velvet, stretch wool and leather – lots of it, moulded or cut like lace by laser or riveted with silver eyelets. Wilson is showing the couture garments, chosen with Alaïa, in themed clusters – velvet, African-inspired, bandage dresses. “You get to see everything in 360 degrees and the groupings mean the viewer gets a better understanding of the craft and the technique,” says Wilson, who has now curated six Alaïa shows. “If you looked at these pieces separately, you would see less how each of them is very special in its own way. You can really see the cuts and seaming and construction, which in other exhibitions you might not be able to appreciate.”Alaïa saw the exhibition as an installation and asked artists to make screens as a backdrop to his work. “I came up with the idea and Azzedine selected the artists, who include Marc Newson, Tatiana Trouvé and the Bouroullec brothers. Wrapping around the walls is a series of pictures taken by Richard Wentworth, who spent two years documenting Maison Alaïa.“I make clothes women make fashion,” the designer said. For Black, the magic of the Alaïa look is that it is timeless. “They are garments that you look fantastic in today, much as you would have done 20 years ago, or will do in 20 years’ time,” she says. “It’s that craftsmanship, the perfection. In the exhibition you do see patterns and dresses that he’s been working on and reworking throughout his career, but in parallel you see very interesting variations of fabric. He’s always bringing innovation in there – the laser-cutting or working with a glass powder that gives fabric an iridescence. There’s innovation as well as a respect of a certain tradition.”When Michael Jackson made the 1992 video for In the Closet – directed by Herb Ritts, co-starring Naomi Campbell and with a voiceover by Princess Stéphanie of Monaco – Alaïa provided Campbell’s barely there clothes, white crop top and flippy skirt. This was the glitzy stratosphere he inhabited. The designer was made more famous by a line in the 1995 film Clueless when Alicia Silverstone’s fashion-obsessed Cher is robbed at gunpoint and refuses to get to the ground with the immortal words: “You don’t understand, this is an Alaïa!”But Alaïa himself was not a flashy person. The word most used about him is “humble”. He was kind and empathetic, a friend and guide to many people, including Mark Wilson who knew him for 22 years. “Oh, he was a sweetheart. I loved him,” says Wilson. “We were family. He was my favourite artist and he also opened his home to me.” He was a father figure for Naomi Campbell, who knew him as Papa, and moved into his apartment in Paris when she was 16. The model made a compassionate speech about him at the British Fashion Awards after his death last year: “Back in the day, our fridges weren’t stuffed with food: we bought what we ate on a daily basis and if there was one egg left in his fridge, Papa would offer it to me to make an omelette.”Born in Tunis, the child of wheat farmers, he studied sculpture before transferring, self-taught, to fashion. He moved to Paris in 1957 and got a job at Christian Dior, but was dismissed after five days for not having the correct papers. After working with Guy Laroche and Thierry Mugler he set up on his own, but it wasn’t until 1979 that he opened his own atelier, where he dressed Greta Garbo and Marie-Hélène de Rothschild.He is perhaps most recognised for dressing the supermodels who bestrode the 1980s and 90s – Elle Macpherson, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell – as well as the awesome frames of Grace Jones and Stephanie Seymour. The height of these women and his lack of it often proved irresistible to photographers images of the 5ft 3in Alaïa, towered over by some 6ft super-beauty, possess something of the fairytale. But his clothes were not only for Amazons. The Kardashian sisters, with their curves and gloss, look like they were conceived to wear Alaïa and are devotees. So, too, is his friend the gallerist Carla Sozzani, as was her late sister Franca, who was editor-in-chief of Italian Vogue. Pale blonde Italian waifs, they slipped their slim frames into wide-tiered skirts with flat black shoes so that the architecture of the dresses swung around them like kinetic sculpture.“He was at the service of women,” says Black. “Some have been his couture clients for a lifetime – once you start wearing Alaïa you just never stop. But even with his ready-to-wear he put so much attention into the structure. They don’t crumple and don’t fall the wrong way. A lot of the women we’ve talked to mention this feeling of empowerment they have while wearing his clothes. When you feel so beautiful, you feel confident and you can go out and take on the world.”The museum will exhibit a few dresses in the public foyer, alongside photography, as a taster for a wider audience. With a new flagship three-storey Alaïa store recently opened on London’s New Bond Street, this is perhaps the biggest year ever for the once tiny label. Alaïa may have left us, but his legend will endure.Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier is at The Design Museum from 10 May to 7 October (designmuseum.org)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/634b7105cc55f09cdfade43729354030f0a89e9c/0_20_2245_1346/master/2245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d61d397945bb6dc64d143315af578e","title":"good time girl memories of a super groupie","story":"Pamela Des Barres had the giants of rock’n’roll in the palm of her hand, as her candid memoir revealsBarely 30 seconds in and Pamela Des Barres has not so much name-dropped as chucked her diary on the table. I compliment the author of I’m With the Band – one of the all-time classic rock’n’roll memoirs – on her ornate necklace, and she says it used to belong to Psycho actor Janet Leigh. When I ask if she still has the jewellery gifted to her by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, she replies, bereft: “No, it was stolen, by a kleptomaniac married to one of the Beach Boys.”Then, as we scan the menu in the rapidly busying Friday night dining room of an in-crowd Hollywood hotel, I idly enquire as to her dietary habits. “I haven’t eaten red meat for 45 years. I went with Don Johnson, one of my dudes,” she says of the then-future star of Miami Vice, “to the first vegetarian restaurant in LA. And I saw on the back of the menu how we get the red meat. And I was so appalled that I stopped that day.”I’m With the Band, the classic confessional of Des Barres’s sexual and romantic escapades with a cacophony of rock stars, is republished in a 30th anniversary edition this month. In bracing detail, the woman born Pamela Miller in Reseda, California, details her high jinks on the Sunset Strip of late-60s and early-70s Los Angeles.Led Zep, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, the Kinks, the Who… These were many of the greatest acts of the cultural revolution, and Pamela – who turned 20 in 1968 – knew them all. She alchemised adolescent Beatles fandom into a new type of ardour: that of the groupie.“A groupie is someone who loves the music so much she wants to be around the people who make it,” she explains. “A fan is content with an autograph or a look from the stage, or a selfie. A groupie takes the next step. And that takes a lot of courage. But they do so totally willingly, sometimes hoping for a romance, or a one-night stand – or sometimes hoping to marry them,” Des Barres hoots.If groupie behaviour was judged then – the loose morals of silly girls, exploited by lascivious rock stars – it can appear even less savoury today. But before we get into that – and the still-no-holds-barred Des Barres, now 69, will happily get into that – let’s view a highlights reel.As depicted in the book, the gateway crush for the teenager who Robert Plant and Mick Jagger would come to call “Miss Pamela” was the singer with San Diego band Iron Butterfly. But her relationship with Who drummer Keith Moon was considerably more important, even though she was simultaneously seeing renegade country singer Waylon Jennings. “I was Keith’s LA girl, and there was no doubt about it. I knew that whenever he came to town he’d call no one but me,” Des Barres recalls, wistful even now for the tragic Moon the Loon, who died in 1978 aged 32.“I was the muse,” she adds, “and I don’t care what people say about that. Groupies enhanced these people’s lives in a huge way. And if it weren’t for us, they would not be who they are.” Page was more meaningful still. “I was in love with Jimmy and I was gonna be true to him. At this point I had only slept with four people people think I was this wild insane maniac!” But then along came Jagger, whom she’d lusted after since her school days. “Mick was number five. He convinced me that Jimmy wasn’t being true to me on the road. So I decided, ‘OK, I’ve wanted this guy forever, I might as well do it.’ And we had this long-term fling that was really awesome.”Her love of English rock stars eventually propelled Des Barres to Chelsea, in the heart of Swinging London. When two American tourists mistook her for Jagger’s girlfriend she thought she’d attained some kind of nirvana. “Fucking Mick on his pillows in the middle of his living room, listening to Dylan,” Des Barres sighs now, wistful once more. “There was nothing better on earth.”What was Jagger’s reaction when I’m With The Band was originally published? “He was asked once in Rolling Stone what he thought of the book. He said: ‘I was there.’ It made me feel good. He had no problem with it, in other words. No one has.” So no one tried to sue her? “Absolutely not. Because I was telling the truth, in a sweet way. I was telling my truth.”Of course, there’s truth then, and there’s perception now. We discuss her friend and fellow groupie Lori Maddox. She’s been dragged into social media “debates” in the #MeToo era from those who decry her losing her virginity to David Bowie at the age of 15. “I’m very proud of Lori for the way she’s handled this whole thing. She’s very proud of her history. She has no regrets at all. A lot of people have come after her and she just doesn’t rise to it.”Do they come after her because, as she was 15 she was, by definition, abused? “She was not abused,” is Des Barres’s firm conviction. “Because that’s what she wanted. Yeah, she was young. And nowadays 15 is not what it used to be. And prior to that era, 15 was not what it became. It was just a period in time when things like that happened and it was OK! It was a short period in time. But it was our reality, and everyone was OK with it.”In 1977, Pamela married English rock star Michael Des Barres. He was a raging cocaine addict so she vowed, on the spot, to give up drugs. They had a son together, but orced in 1991. She’s had a few relationships since then, but is currently single. Today she finds strength in her faith, something that has deepened over the years. As to how she squares her sexual escapades with Christian morality, she acknowledges that, “I fought with it. Until I finally realised that the orgasm – la petite mort – is godly. The orgasm is when you actually forget everything else but that. So you are actually one with all that is. And when the orgasms continued, I came to realise that sex is so good, so important, so connecting with the ine.”Putting her CV where her soul is, she’s also an ordained minister. Pamela Des Barres can officiate your wedding and throw in, too, eye-popping anecdotes about Jim Morrison getting her off gorilla anaesthetic Trimar, and why she only went to third base with the Kinks’ Ray Davies.These days, Des Barres still lives for the music. She throws gigs in her backyard, and hosts rock’n’roll tours of “her” LA for tourists. “I’ve become this historical person,” she smiles, “which is so weird.”But don’t go mistaking that for sadness, an elegy for an era whose time’s up, for a youth wasted. Pamela Des Barres was her own woman then and she’s her own woman now.“I miss a lot of people who didn’t make it,” she says quietly, “but there are plenty people who did. So, no, I have no sadness about it at all.” I’m With The Band: Confessions of a Groupie by Pamela Des Barres is published by Omnibus Press at £14.99.

From then until 2011, I hadn’t set foot in the other side of the park. There are an awful lot of stories like\u0026nbspthat.”The three-metre fence, one of scores of so-called “peace walls” that still ide loyalist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland, was erected in 1994. Yet thanks to work by cross-community workers such as Shannon, and after a lengthy consultation exercise, the gate was added in 2011.“We were having people coming from all over the world to look at our gate,” he says. “It was the symbolism. People started moving freely through it. Gradually we opened it later and later. Now we’re in the position where it’s open all day, every day.”Twenty years on from the Good Friday Agreement, similar cross-community projects are under way with the aim of taking down peace walls across the city. The fact that so many remain in place is evidence of the often glacial pace of progress. As the painstaking work continues, however, it is not lost on those labouring to bring down physical and sectarian barriers that the vote for Brexit has led to the threat of new ones being erected.The British and Irish governments and the European Union have all said that they do not want the return of any border infrastructure on the island of Ireland. Yet London’s determination to leave both the EU’s customs union and the single market has created a policy problem that is proving perhaps the most challenging aspect of the Brexit fallout.When Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, visited border communities and businesses last week, he was told in no uncertain terms about the strength of feeling involved in even the most innocuous border equipment.“I’m 60 years old, I’ve lived right along the border all my life,” says Declan Fearon, a kitchen maker who is part of a border group that met Barnier. He used to be able to see a border watchtower from his house near Jonesborough. “I remember the days when some people who came to mass on a Sunday used to have to park at the barriers and walk to the chapel. The last watchtower to be taken away was the one right behind my home.“I’ve lived through all of that and I really fear the return of any of that for my grandkids and the psychological impact on a community here that lived with it for so many years. It’s reopening a wound. It is quite clear that no one wants a return to the border, but are the British government being genuine on proposing how to do that? No, they’re not. There was palpable anger felt here when Boris Johnson compared this issue to the London congestion charge. Come along and meet the people who are worried about this.”One official who has been working on cross-border trade since the Good Friday Agreement recalls that, at the start of the process, he had to attend all meetings with the text of the legislation piled on the table, because there were inevitable arguments about interpreting the level of cooperation it stipulated.Now the meetings have become reassuringly boring, focused on how to help economies both north and south. “When we started, we were looking at barriers,” the official explains. “Now we look at opportunities. With Brexit, there’s the potential that you could be going back to dealing with barriers, and I think everyone is agreed that that isn’t what we want.”In Belfast, as with so many issues, many fear that Brexit and the border issue is already adding another sectarian strut to community politics. In Tigers Bay, the loyalist community on one side of Alexandra Park, a new mural appeared during the referendum campaign that reads “Vote Leave EU” and is accompanied by a reference to a biblical verse: Revelation chapter 18 verse 4.The verse states: “And I heard another voice from the heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye not be partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” Rab McCallum, a former republican prisoner who now works to remove peace walls through the North Belfast Interface Network, is among those with concerns. He is sitting in a coffee shop in the Houben Centre, north Belfast, another cross-community project. It has an entrance on either side of the building, in effect connecting the loyalist and nationalist parts of what he describes as “one of the most notorious interfaces in all of the Troubles”.“There have been more people killed here than all other areas, so it has been hugely impacted by the conflict,” he says. “We had the success of taking down the first peace wall in 30 years, just across the road, at a time when there were problems. Despite the lack of political progress, the people on the ground seemed to be in front of the political process.The everyday impact of the border dilemma is being missed in the Westminster debate, warns Deirdre Heenan, professor of social policy at Ulster University, who is also from a border community near Newry.“I was in London last week and there was discussion about the trade and the economy and the customs union and the single market, but absolutely no discussion of the psychological and social impact of a border – whatever it may look like,” she says.“Most people believe that the British government don’t understand the problem. It’s not only that they haven’t come up with a solution, it’s that they can’t come up with a solution to a problem they don’t understand.“Clearly in the referendum, the fact that we would be the only land border to the EU wasn’t thought about. We were an afterthought. Yes, we have a peace, but it is a fragile peace. It is a journey we are on and we haven’t reached the final destination.“Sometimes it sounds like overstatement, but borders have an emotional meaning and they are symbols of difference. That just seems to be dismissed, but it is hugely significant for people here.”Of the Irish officials and ministers the Observer consulted last week, all said that the British government had failed to provide any confidence that it had a solution to resolve its promise of a frictionless border. As a result, all pointed to the so-called “backstop” agreement signed by Theresa May last year, which dictates that, should the UK government fail to provide a solution, Northern Ireland would remain in a “common regulatory area” with the EU.“The UK government signed off on a backstop arrangement,” says Michael Creed, the Irish agriculture minister. “That’s the fail-safe. For reasons that transcend economics, there can be no resiling from that commitment. If the UK comes up with a better arrangement, obviously the Barnier taskforce and the Irish government are quite open to seeing the colour of that and how it would effectively operate. There can be no resiling from that backstop arrangement.”For all the concerns, however, supporters of Brexit warn that the issues around the border and the impact on the peace process are being inflated as a negotiating tactic\u0026nbspby both Ireland and the EU. Refusing to give any ground could ultimately force the UK to remain inside the bloc’s customs union and single market.“The border is perfectly solvable,” says Lee Reynolds, the DUP director of policy and former Vote Leave coordinator in Northern Ireland. “Things that were presented as insurmountable have already been surmounted. The EU is offering a no-tariff deal already. There are a lot of things that were part of Project Fear that have been dealt with and resolved. They were legitimate things to raise, but it doesn’t mean they were impossible.“The border has got wrapped up in much bigger negotiating politics. It isn’t true that there is no solution. It’s that some people would prefer there not to be one. The best thing that ever happened for Vote Leave was when Tony Blair and John Major came over to threaten the peace process. That’s when unionists drifting to Leave became like snow off a ditch.”He adds that, far from undoing cross-community work, Brexit could be an opportunity for more. “Brexit is not an event, it’s what we do with it,” he says. “We can rethink regional policy and try to do better things. There will be potential for more resource – we have money coming back to us. People are talking about keeping existing money, when they should be asking if there is any scope for more. A new round of peace funding has also been secured.”This sunny optimism cuts little ice with people such as Fearon. He believes that feeling on the issue is so strong, and the determination not to return to the bad old days so deep-rooted, that people might take matters into their own hands should any border infrastructure pop up.Leading Brexiters argue that new technology can be used to find ways of allowing frictionless trade across the Irish border - and the technology would not have to be placed on the border itself. However, details have been thin on the ground and many warn that no such solution currently exists.A special dealThe European Union would allow Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and the single market, but that would mean checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain - an outcome fiercely opposed by unionists. It would also lead to demands for a similar deal for Scotland, putting Scottish Tory MPs at loggerheads with the leadership.A customs partnershipThe UK would collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf, easing the need for border checks. Problems remain, however. The idea is opposed by Brexiter cabinet ministers and dismissed by the EU. A partnership would also have to be accompanied by a degree of alignment with the EU’s single market to eliminate checks completely.Soft BrexitOpting to keep the entire UK fully inside the EU’s customs union and single market would provide a solution to the Irish border, but would also require Theresa May to rip up her red lines of leaving both. It would also mean Britain could not strike its own trade deals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5856f4e08293a52c6f59ed5bcab026615425099b/312_995_5624_3374/master/5624.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=472400abf7495f26ec498aa7cbb35b3a","title":"african express how bright textiles brought one london home to life","story":"Eva Sonaike’s Nigerian heritage inspires the vibrant colours and patterns at her family houseEva Sonaike’s journey to becoming a textile designer began when she realised she could no longer stand the bland character of the small flat she and her husband used to share. “I was on maternity leave and I felt the need to make it warm, welcoming and more ‘us’,” she says. Eva headed to London’s Petticoat Lane market and bought bolts of bright African wax fabrics to make into cushion covers, throws and curtains.“As a quick fix, it worked,” she says. “Of course, I now know that those materials aren’t right for upholstery – too flimsy, not colourfast and so on. But it made me see very clearly how vibrant fabrics can bring joy into a space.”Ten years later, Eva has moved on – both career-wise and to a new home. She’s designing full time, working from a studio in the garden of her 1930s house in north London, where she lives with her husband Kola Sonaike, a barrister, their son Lolu, aged 10, and daughter Lola, eight.“When we bought this house it was a typical semi and the downstairs rooms were fairly dark,” says Eva. The couple knocked through the ground floor rooms and extended it to create one large split-level space. “My wish list was simple: white walls, dark floors and lots of light,” says Eva. “I knew I was going to add colour and pattern. And I think that works best with a light, clean backdrop.”Inspiration for her fabric designs comes from the regular trips she has made to west Africa since she was a child. While Eva was born in Germany and lived there until moving to London in her 20s to work as a fashion editor, her heritage is Nigerian. “I grew up knowing that fabrics were held in high esteem in Yoruba culture,” she says. “Thickly woven aso oke cloth was once a form of currency and is still given as a special gift. Or the embroidery on clothing could hold meaning – it might ward off evil, bring wealth or attract a spouse. Fabrics were never just pieces of cloth . They always told some kind of story.”Eva still travels to Africa each year with her own family, trips that now provide the stories for her own designs. “When I’m there, I’m like a sponge,” she says. “I soak up visual stimuli, the scents and the atmosphere. I see patterns in everything, from architecture to nature.”The motifs she sketches are later scanned into Photoshop, where she refines them and adds colours. Eva points to her Ijoba cushion, featuring lush leaves arranged in a stylised 50s-feel pattern. “This one came about after a trip to Ghana for a wedding. Afterwards we took the children up into the mountains to visit an old botanical gardens,” she says. “Everyone said: ‘Don’t bother, it’s so run-down’ – but that just made me want to go even more. When we arrived, the place was shrouded in mist and it felt as if nature had been left to run wild. The gardens were teeming with life – plants unfurling and exploding into flower.”Another design, Ojo, was inspired by the tropical modernism-style walls and balconies of Lagos, reimagined by Eva into an elegant grid of golds and reds. “That post-colonial architecture is an everyday feature of Lagos life,” she says. “I wanted to bring out its beauty.” Other prints feature zebra stripes recast in neon shades, a softened version of batik and shapes inspired by Yoruba embroidery.In her home, Eva’s patterns are complemented by African artefacts that have been in her family since the 1960s and 1970s. “My father was an art historian, so he had a very good eye,” she says. Eva and Kola have added carved figures bought more recently in Lagos’s craft markets. “Look beyond rows of statues darkened with shoe polish and sanded to ‘age’ them and you’ll always find beautifully crafted objects,” she says.Other pieces in Eva’s home include German antiques, a table from north Africa (by way of a Fulham dealer) and high street buys from Habitat and Ikea. Eva also confesses to a bit of a HomeSense habit for vases and lamp bases. “My daughter used to do a gym class near a branch, which was fatal. Luckily, she’s just switched to a ballet class further away.”Back in the dining room, a painting by Damola Adepoju from Nike Art Gallery in Lagos reminds the couple of trips to the city, with its streets rammed with yellow buses. And in the living room, above the cushions depicting her own African-inspired designs, Eva has hung a photograph of a Sudanese girl by Eliot Elisofon. It was taken in 1947 for Life magazine. “It dates from a very different era,” she says. “But as a celebration of African culture and beauty, it still feels very relevant today.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb6309ab10502e4af8081efa72929851171374a/57_116_3344_2007/master/3344.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23906d04518224daf85a6b386207147f","title":"fish and chip shops economy brexit digital disruption national dish","story":"Brexit, online delivery services and bans on plastic threaten Britain’s national dishAnyone wanting to understand the economic problems facing Britain in the early 21st century need only consider its national dish.Chippies are confronting a long list of issues that threaten to send the price of their product rocketing as the holiday season approaches. Brexit, the popularity of online delivery services, freakish weather and concerns about the pollution caused by plastic are all putting pressure on the nation’s 10,500 fish and chip shops.“I’ve had to hold price increases back so I’m taking quite a hit on things because rival shops are undercutting,” said Andrew Crook, president of the National Federation of Fish Friers. At the moment, a cod and chips at Crook’s chippy in Lancashire costs £5.90, but he intends to put his prices up in the summer.“I think summer’s a good time to put prices up. People go on holiday, buy fish and chips and see that some areas are more expensive than back home so that does help.”Six months ago a kilo of haddock or cod frozen at sea cost around £4 and £5.20 respectively. Today haddock costs about £5.60 a kilo and cod almost £5.80. There is little respite closer to home. Costs of cooking oil, rent and rates and labour are rising.Now there is a growing fear that potato prices could soon go the same way. The wet start to the year has delayed the potato planting season. According to Rob Clayton, strategy director for potatoes at the Agriculture \u0026amp Horticulture Development Board, farmers are between two and four weeks behind where they should be. This could bode ill for the future if the summer turns out to be a damp squib like the spring.“The holy grail for potato growers is to get the maximum possible leaf cover by the longest day of the year,” Clayton said. “If we were to get a couple of months of warm and sunny weather the problem would go away. If what we end up with is something that’s dull and cool over the next few months then that would retard the development. That is the scenario when you would start to worry about the volume of the crop.” The good news is that there are considerable supplies of potatoes in storage – but these cannot last for ever. “Once you get into August, September that is where those stocks will have run out and the new crop won’t necessarily be as speedy as we thought it was going to be,” Clayton said. “If you’re going to Blackpool in August that’s when you might be expecting a bit of a pinch around chip shop prices.”Another issue is packaging. Crook said there was pressure on the industry to do away with its polystyrene cartons, which cost around 2p each, and introduce compostable alternatives, made in China, that cost five times as much.“We don’t think it’s a solution,” Crook said. “It’s been dictated by Blue Planet and the government’s reaction to it. As an industry we try to do the right thing but people don’t know what the right thing is.”In the 1920s, there were about 35,000 fish and chip shops in Britain. But the number has fallen by two thirds as a huge variety of new cuisines has arrived on the high street. “We’ve been worried for the last 30 years because we’ve had McDonald’s come in and lots of ethnic cuisines and I think people have been scared to put up their prices,” Crook said.Now the popularity of online delivery services like Deliveroo and Just Eat poses another conundrum. “It’s naive to think deliveries aren’t the way to go,” Crook conceded. “But I don’t think the perfect packaging is there for it right now. With fish and chips you’ve got to keep it crisp. You can’t do five deliveries and come back to base. You’ve got to do each one inidually and the margins are not there for that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ebea6650a93cdd76c7cb9d7d9b6f3a06a3a12a5/495_511_4625_2775/master/4625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d70ae44cdfa44e546b135441abd78bb","title":"is is weird to write to say sorry to my ex three years on","story":"Do it! Says Mariella. Keep it simple, keep it brief, write it from the heartThe dilemma Three years ago, I split up with my girlfriend of seven years. I felt very unhappy and put it down to the relationship. She was devastated and wanted to resolve things. But by that stage I’d made my mind up. I’ve lived a quiet, celibate life since, which has given me time to reflect. It struck me that I’d been very selfish – after an initial romantic period where I pulled all manner of stunts to impress her, my effort as a boyfriend tapered down to the bare minimum. Secondly, I realised they had been the best days of my life. We went on amazing adventures which we probably wouldn’t have done otherwise, and had very different skills sets, which complemented each other. After we split up, I made little effort to maintain our friendship, maybe because I felt guilty. Now I’m ashamed of how I treated her and can’t forgive myself. I want to write and apologise, but it sounds weird and inappropriate. It’s hard to write without it sounding like a rapprochement, which it isn’t. Is writing such a letter an appropriate thing to do?Mariella replies Hell, yes! We should all be writing letters to our lovers, ex or otherwise whether it’s just to say hello, to expand on our feelings, because our behaviour has been less than exemplary, or perhaps, as in your case, to say thanks for a union that may be long over but in hindsight appears so much more precious than you realised at the time. There are few things more soul enhancing than knowing that you’ve had a positive impact on another person’s life, that you were appreciated and that whatever may have led to your parting, a residue of love remains scattered over the debris of the relationship.I’d argue we should be writing more missives of the tangible and non-electronic variety. Otherwise when we’re old and grey how will we know that anyone cared for us at all, or remember the names of those who have long since slipped from our lives, emotionally, geographically or permanently? Searching your inbox just isn’t the same as dragging a box from the loft and having your life leap out to meet you. I recently found a folder full of a jumble of past correspondence, covering old love letters and fractious disputes, baffling postcards of some importance at the time and notes from luminaries whose attention I briefly captured for one reason or another – and it proved an emotional couple of hours sifting through those faded but still legible scraps.A message to my hotel room in Morocco in the 1990s read like a title for a novel: “Mr Miss You from Rabat” had called, hurling me back to memories of Robert, the gentleman caller, who’d obviously challenged the translating abilities of the Mamounia operator with his note. On another sliver of near-translucent paper was the marriage proposal I received three decades ago via a switchboard operator at the Parker Meridien in New York who’d hastily typed it up and slipped it under my door with a squashed red rose! There were sexy letters from a lover that made me blush, extolling my “eyes as green as Eastleach water meadows” and a letter from my mother with her overview on the chronology of my peripatetic childhood. There was huge pleasure in revisiting those moments, the words belying the heft of the emotions they bore while the paper carried sensory messages from a past age.Communication today is functional, and deleted within seconds of receipt. Like the photographs that linger in devices that become obsolete faster than we can learn to use them, it seems that the next generation will have to trawl Facebook to take their trips down memory lane. It certainly lacks the romance of a battered box, but since Facebook seems to know more about us than we do ourselves it may nonetheless prove a riveting archive. What a sad loss though to be unable to sniff the leaf, puzzle over the smudges or feel your heart leap at the loop of familiar handwriting decades after it was last viewed. As a regular performer for the brilliantly conceived Letters Live project, I’ve had the pleasure of exposure to some of the finest letters ever written and whether they’re slapping you down, or building you up, they’re a much undervalued art form.So, your heart is in the right place and your compulsion a good one. I’m wondering if your reluctance to write and let her know it wasn’t her fault is because what you are secretly after is a rapprochement. If that’s the case I’m not in a position to judge whether it’s right or wrong, but it does slightly temper my enthusiasm. The greatest gift in the world is a letter that wants nothing but offers a loving thought, or apology, or simply a hello.Keep it simple is my advice don’t try to channel Shelley. If all you want is tell her you regret your behaviour and think of that period with fondness, do just that. Keep it brief, don’t overload the memories, write it from the heart and don’t go into detail about your current state of mind. This letter, if your description is an accurate one, is not about you. So don’t dally another moment, put pen to paper and get your sense of gratitude off your chest and into her heart.

What does gathering that much data actually involve? And what does that data tell us about ourselves?The Cambridge Analytica scandal has raised question after question, but for many, the technological USP of the company, which announced last week that it was closing its operations, remains a mystery.For those 87 million people probably wondering what was actually done with their data, I went back to Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica employee who blew the whistle on the company’s problematic operations in the Observer. According to Wylie, all you need to know is a little bit about data science, a little bit about bored rich women, and a little bit about human psychology... Step one, he says, over the phone as he scrambles to catch a train: “When you’re building an algorithm, you first need to create a training set.” That is: no matter what you want to use fancy data science to discover, you first need to gather the old-fashioned way. Before you can use Facebook likes to predict a person’s psychological profile, you need to get a few hundred thousand people to do a 120-question personality quiz.At the other end, you need your “target variables” – in Wylie’s words, “the things that you’re trying to predict for. So in this case, personality traits or political orientation, or what have you.”If you’re trying to use one thing to predict another, it helps if you can look at both at the same time. “If you want to know the relationships between Facebook likes in your feature set and personality traits as your target variables, you need to see both,” says Wylie.Facebook data, which lies at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica story, is a fairly plentiful resource in the data science world – and certainly was back in 2014, when Wylie first started working in this area. Personality traits are much harder to get hold of: despite what the proliferation of BuzzFeed quizzes might suggest, it takes quite a lot to persuade someone to fill in a 120-question survey (the length of the short version of one of the standard psychological surveys, the Ipip-Neo).“Quite a lot” is relative, however. “For some people, the incentive to take a survey is financial. If you’re a student or looking for work or just want to make $5, that’s an incentive.” The actual money handed over, Wylie says, “ranged from $2 to $4”. The higher payments go to “groups that were harder to get”. The group least likely to take a survey, and so earning the most from it, were African American men. “Other people take surveys just because they find it interesting, or they are bored. So we over-sampled wealthy white women. Because if you live in the Hamptons and have nothing to do in the afternoon, you fill out consumer research surveys.”The personality surveys use those 120 questions to profile people along five discrete axes – the “five factors” model, popularly called the “Ocean” model after one common breakdown of the factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.That model clusters personality traits into distinctions that seem to hold across cultures and across time. So, for instance, those who describe themselves as “loud” are likely to also describe themselves as “gregarious”. If they agree with that description this year, they’re likely to agree with it next year. That cluster is likely to show up in responses in every language. And if a person responds to it negatively, there are likely to be real, noticeable differences between them and people who answer it positively.Those features of the model are what make it actually useful for profiling iniduals, says Wylie – in contrast to some other popular psychological profiles such as the Myers-Briggs system. In the testing phase of the research, Facebook was barely involved. The surveys were offered on commercial data research sites – first Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, then a specialist operator called Qualtrics. (The switch was made, Wylie says, because Amazon has the issue that “people are overfamiliar with filling out surveys” – so much so that it starts to affect your results.)It was only at the very end that Facebook came into play. In order to be paid for their survey, users were required to log in to the site, and approve access to the survey app developed by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University academic whose research into personality profiling using Facebook likes provided the perfect access for the Robert Mercer-funded Cambridge Analytica to quickly get in on the field. (Kogan maintains that Cambridge Analytica assured him they were using data appropriately and says he has been “used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica”.)To a survey user, the process was quick: “You click the app, you go on, and then it gives you the payment code.” But two very important things happened in those few seconds. First, the app harvested as much data as it could about the user who just logged on. Where the psychological profile is the target variable, the Facebook data is the “feature set”: the information a data scientist has on everyone else, which they need to use in order to accurately predict the features they really want to know.Second, the app did the same thing for all the friends of the user who installed it. Suddenly the hundreds of thousands of people who you’ve paid a couple of dollars to fill out a survey, whose personalities are a mystery, become millions of people whose Facebook profiles are an open book.That’s where the final transformation comes in. How do you turn a few hundred thousand personality profiles into a few million? With a lot of computing power, and a massive matrix of possibilities. “Even though your sample size is 300,000 people, give or take, your feature set is like 100m across,” says Wylie. Every single Facebook “like” found in the data set becomes its own column in this enormous matrix. “Even if there is only one instance in the entire set, it’s still a feature.”“All that data was then put into an ensemble model,” Wylie says. “This is when you use different families or approaches of machine learning, because each of them will have their own strengths and weaknesses... and then they sort of vote, and then you amalgamate the results and come up with a conclusion.” This is where data science becomes more of a data art: the exact input of each approach to the overall model isn’t set in stone, and there’s no right way to do it. In the academic world, it’s sometimes called “training by grad student” – the point where the only thing to do is move forward through laborious trial and error. Still, it worked well enough, and in the end, Wylie says, “we built 253 algorithms, which meant there were 253 predictions per profiled record”. The goal was achieved: a model that could effectively take the Facebook likes of its subjects and work backwards, filling in the rest of the columns in the spreadsheet to arrive at guesses as to their personalities, political affiliations and more.By the end of August 2014, Wylie had the first successful outputs: 2.1m profiled records, from 11 target US states, the plan being that they would be used to communicate and refine messages in Mercer and Steve Bannon-backed Republican campaigns leading up to the 2016 primaries (Wylie left before these). “What that number represents is people who not only have their Facebook data, voter data, and consumer data (which was all matched up), but also had an additional 253 predictions or scores that were then appended to their profile.”Those 253 predictions were the “secret sauce” that Cambridge Analytica claimed it could offer its customers. Using Facebook itself, advertisers are limited to broad demographic strokes, and a few narrower algorithmically determined categories – whether you like jazz music, say, or what your favourite sports team is. But with 253 further predictions, Cambridge Analytica could, Wylie says, craft adverts no one else could: a neurotic, extroverted and agreeable Democrat could be targeted with a radically different message than an emotionally stable, introverted, intellectual one, each designed to suppress their voting intention – even if the same messages, swapped around, would have the opposite effect.Wylie brings up the anodyne political statement that a candidate is in favour of jobs. “Jobs in the economy is a good example because it’s a meaningless message. Everyone’s pro-jobs in the economy. So in that sense, using just the message of ‘I am in favour of jobs in the economy’, or ‘I have a plan to fix jobs in the economy’, you cannot differentiate yourself from your opponent.“But one of the things that we found was that actually when you unpack what is a job for different people, different people engage with constructs with different motivations and value sets that are interrelated with their dispositions.”What that means in practice is that the same blandishment can be dressed up in different language for different personalities, creating the impression of a candidate who connects with voters on an emotional level. “If you’re talking to a conscientious person” – one who ranks highly on the C part of the Ocean model – “you talk about the opportunity to succeed and the responsibility that a job gives you. If it’s an open person, you talk about the opportunity to grow as a person. Talk to a neurotic person, and you emphasise the security that it gives to my family.”Thanks to the networked nature of modern campaigning, in theory all these messages can be delivered simultaneously to different groups. Towards the end of the campaign, once the messaging has settled in, they can even be automated, Mad Libs-style, with an algorithm churning through a thesaurus to find the perfect combination of words to win over different subgroups.Of course, it isn’t all blandishments. One message used to boost rightwing turnout attacked same-sex marriage. “It’s funny, because this is so offensive and implicitly homophobic, but it’s a team of gays that created it,” Wylie says. “It was targeting conscientious people. It was a picture of a dictionary and it said ‘Look up marriage and get back to me’. For someone who is conscientious, it is a compelling message: a dictionary is a source of order, and a conscientious person is more deferential to structure.”At a certain point, psychometric targeting moves into the realm of dog-whistle campaigning. Images of walls proved to be really effective in campaigning around immigration, for instance. “Conscientious people like structure, so for them, a solution to immigration should be orderly, and a wall embodied that. You can create messaging that doesn’t make sense to some people but makes so much sense to other people. If you show that image, some people wouldn’t get that that’s about immigration, and others immediately would get that.” The actual issues, for Wylie, are simply the “plain white toast” of politics, waiting for the actual flavour to be loaded on. “No one wants plain white toast.” The job of the data, he says, is to “learn the particular flavour or spice” that will make that toast appealing.While this was undoubtedly a highly sophisticated targeting machine, questions remain about Cambridge Analytica’s psychometric model – ones Wylie, perhaps, isn’t best placed to answer. When Kogan gave evidence to parliament in April, he suggested that it was barely better than chance at applying the right Ocean scores to iniduals. Maybe that edge is enough to matter – or maybe CA was selling snake oil. And even if iniduals were correctly labelled with the five factors, is advertising to them based on that really as simple as slightly hokey-sounding appeals to love of order, or fear of the other?That said, there’s clearly something in it. Take a look instead at a patent filed in 2012 on “determining user personality characteristics from social networking system communications”. “Stored personality characteristics may be used as targeting criteria for advertisers ... to increase the likelihood that the user … positively interacts with a selected advertisement,” the patent suggests. Its author?

You’ve had Windrush, you’ve had Grenfell, you’ve had the Brexit negotiations going from bad to worse, you’ve had the National Health Service under more pressure than it’s been for a long, long time, serial incompetence day after day after day, yet the public do not seem in nearly sufficient numbers remotely interested in supporting the Labour party.”Campbell, who backs a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal, said Labour should not be seen as supporting Theresa May’s plans for leaving the EU.Referencing a Blair-era soundbite, Campbell said Labour should be “tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit”, fighting against the UK’s departure from the EU while addressing the concerns of those who voted to leave.He said that if Labour’s Brexit tests were to mean anything the party could not support May’s strategy. “If they do, then though the Tories will be seen as Brexit’s architect, Labour will be its bricklayer, and history is harsh when the house comes tumbling down,” he said.“My Labour tribalism is being pushed to the limit by the return of militant-style nastiness in local politics, by my revulsion that any antisemitism has been allowed to fester, by the feeling that some in the leadership and their supporters feel much greater animus against other Labour supporters than against Tories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f28de778168e3273ae15696d6faeb9e20498fac/0_218_4310_2586/master/4310.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8bb7e6d6e80c76420ab81bd716e3bb0","title":"thousands scottish independence supporters march through glasgow","story":"March was organised by All Under One Banner coalition, which aims to run regular events until ‘Scotland is free’Tens of thousands of independence supporters marched through the streets of Glasgow, aiming to bring Scotland’s largest city to a standstill.Marchers draped in Saltires waved flags and played bagpipes and drums as they walked from Kelvingrove to Glasgow Green on Saturday. The event is one of a series being held across Scotland by All Under One Banner. The pro-independence organisation aims to march at regular intervals “until Scotland is free”.“Glasgow city centre will be brought to a standstill as our independence march traverses through en route to George Square,” one member of the organisation said on a fundraising page before the event.The march achieved a high turnout. Police Scotland estimated that 35,000 people joined the procession, which ended with speeches and music on the green.A small number of pro-union campaigners met the procession to counter its message. Stuart McMillan, a MSP for the Scottish National party, wrote on Twitter that he had received abuse including “a azi salute and the middle finger” from pro-union campaigners. Amanda McGinley took part in the march with her daughter Ellie Casson, with both women sporting Saltire bows in their hair. “We’re just basically fighting for the cause. We’re serial marchers,” she said.Lesley Crawford said she had come to show support. “There is still a lot of people who are still campaigning for a vote for independence, and we’re not going away,” she said.He said that level of support for Scotland leaving the UK was “a good place to start from” and that backing for independence was edging up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28e8f6a58a86a60dace9dcfd3ef93b7b7c0bc21f/368_0_3103_1862/master/3103.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2f9968a51cae0c175abadc8cf16bed2","title":"tony bellew david haye","story":"There will be no more false dawns, no more bragging or bruises, no victory speeches either, for David Haye. Knocked down and out of boxing in five rounds by Tony Bellew, the former world champion at cruiser and heavyweight can leave now at 37 knowing, on balance, he has taken as much from the fight game as he has\u0026nbspgiven.“Take nothing away from David Haye,” the winner said in the ring. “He just got into a slug-fest tonight. The speed and timing go with age. I’ve done it, that’s all. Style makes fights, I’ve always said it.”As he had conceded in their first fight, Haye said: “He was the better boxer tonight, a great champion.” Bellew did not signal the definitive end to Haye’s career, but there is diminishing hunger to watch someone who was once one of the biggest and most exciting hitters in the ision.The whistles and boos that greeted his entrance for this rematch were replaced by predictable if subdued rumbles of sympathy and maybe appreciation of his bravery at the end. Down three times in all, he probably would have carried on had there been no referee – or paying customers. The fighters’ antipathy was genuine, although it melded into mutual respect afterwards.Bellew was a brutally magnificent finisher, biding his time, taking the odd hard head shot and pouncing like a cat when the openings came as Haye’s legs slowed.Haye admitted in his dressing room beforehand he needed to be “a lot better” than he was here 14 months ago, when his achilles snapped in round six and he did well to reach the 11th, his corner throwing in the towel as he struggled to right himself from a tangle on the ring apron.It is not quite right that a former world champion should be booed by sections of a 20,000 crowd just a few miles from where he was born but Haye feeds off any sort of energy, good or dark, and ignored the crowd in a lively opening.Bellew looked to land his chopping right over Haye’s jab but his opponent was similarly disposed as they shared the second.Haye’s jab, once his spear of choice, was cocked more than delivered in the third and Bellew seized the moment with a cracking right that sent him to the floor, followed by another that had him over again and up on wobbly legs. This time there was no injury to blame – just his own intemperance, as well as the weight of the years that had gone before.The fourth descended into a thrash but Bellew was in total control, stalking and firing bombs. Haye, hurt and disoriented but still there to have the argument, looked as if he could go at any moment, his head a dart-board now.Haye needed to make a statement even to get past halfway but the narrative was out of his hands. Bellew, so emotional outside the ring, had turned into a cold-eyed predator, wary of his wounded foe but ready to strike again. There was a lull in the fifth, then another teeth-rattling left hook to put Haye down in the centre of the ring. As proud as any British fighter of recent years, the Bermondsey man knew the end was near but he did not want it, surely, to be at the intervention of the referee while he was still standing with his back to the ropes.Then again, very few boxers get to choose the manner and time of their leaving. This had to be Haye’s.The Olympic silver-medallist Joe Joyce, who is in Haye’s stable and shares his new Cuban trainer, Ismael Salas, stepped up a few levels in just his fourth professional bout earlier to win the Commonwealth heavyweight title by stopping the seasoned but bewildered Jamaican champion, Lenroy Thomas in two rounds. Joyce, still learning his trade at 32, had the champion down three times and was landing at will. A left hook to the jaw finished the job. He will harder nights than this from now on.Rio bronze medal light-heavy Joshua Buatsi – one of the few pros with a university degree - racked up his sixth paid win, stopping the Frenchman Stephane Cuevas in the fifth of six.There was woe for the fancied Martin J Ward, who was beaten and stopped for the first time in his 22-bout career, when he found the heavy hands of the Belfast super-feather James Tennyson too much to cope with in the fifth round of their Commonwealth, European and WBA International title fight. He had Tennyson on the floor in the second but was drawn into a brawl and sank to the ropes twice at the end, dazed and hurt.Paul Butler, who lost a challenge for the world super-fly title three years ago, overshot the bantamweight limit by more than 3lbs on Friday, and had nothing to fight for but a pay cheque and pride. The latter was dented in the first round when the unbeaten Puerto Rican, Emmanuel Rodríguez, felled him with a wicked left. Butler, 29, regrouped and had his moments but not enough to dominate a round and the visitor was a convincing winner of the vacant IBF title, by two cards of 120-106 and one of 118-108."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c31a77c5b5acf23d66cbf112879d978af7ef73/898_1009_4759_2855/master/4759.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a9a9578ca035d078778e8c6d94a524f","title":"david hare james graham drama politics labour party","story":"David Hare and James Graham are close neighbours in London’s West End. Hare’s The Moderate Soprano is on at the Duke of York’s theatre, St Martin’s Lane, and Graham’s Quiz is just a few doors along at the Noël Coward. Graham is, in his mid-30s, a theatrical dynamo, while Hare, at 70, could now qualify as a grand old man of theatre, continuing on his own extraordinary marathon. Each of them has written more about British politics – and in particular the Labour party – than any other playwright alive.Hare’s The Absence of War (1993) was about an opposition leader, based on Neil Kinnock. In the ensuing decades, he has been an interpreter of political and private lives, writing contentiously about everything from education (Skylight, 1995) and the railways (The Permanent Way, 2003) to the West Bank (Via Dolorosa, 1998) and the Iraq war (Stuff Happens, 2004). His new play, I’m Not Running, opening at the National Theatre, London, in the autumn, will return to the subject of Labour. James Graham’s This House (2012), set in the whips’ office, was a virtuoso piece about the hung parliament battles of the 70s. The Vote, at the Donmar, was broadcast live on television during the 2015 election, and Labour of Love (2017) at the Noël Coward, a look at the party over 25 years – for which he has just won an Olivier for “best new comedy” – sealed his reputation.Hare is tall, dashing and potentially ready for friendly fire. To be combative comes naturally but today he is amused and receptive – though never pointlessly compliant. Graham shows up late, with the look of a bright, flustered student. He is empathetic and modest in the way people with no need to boast sometimes are. And there is no mistaking that Hare is a hero to him – the admiration unfeigned. Our conversation kicks off with an argument about the relationship between politics and theatre. In The Absence of War, George Jones implies there is an affinity, saying to another politician: “You don’t go to the theatre, you’re missing out there, everyone in politics should.” In Quiz, Paul, a TV producer, comments: “Some people say that politics is just performance.” But Hare declares that the list of theatregoing politicians is short: “Neil Kinnock was exceptional in being a theatregoer. George Osborne, in a way that was incomprehensible to me, was a theatregoer. Tony Blair was a theatregoer.” He adds: “There is a strongly philistine tradition in British politics, isn’t there?”James joins in cautiously, suggesting theatre and politics are places to “ask questions” – before getting into his stride.James Graham: Theatre is one of the last long forms – there is something about institutions that is intrinsically theatrical. When I described politics as a performance, I was exploring the symbolic shift when the chief whips were kicked out of Downing Street and replaced by a PR machine – government becoming an exercise in public relations rather than a search for truths and solutions.It could be argued that politics involves relentless auditioning. Which of today’s politicians would you cast as actors?David Hare: Colin Powell at the UN, in 2003 – claiming there was irrefutable proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We now know he was not altogether in good faith but he did appear sincere – it was a barnstorming performance.JG: I’m fascinated by the idea that Margaret Thatcher was a fictional character invented by Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi – the voice, the outfit – even the philosophy. Theresa May is, we assume, acting – we are told she has to sell something she does not believe in with Brexit. What does that do to you when you have to keep compartmentalising?DH: People tend to ask: do politicians know they’re lying? Are they sincere or insincere? Politicians don’t think in those terms. They think: this is the case I have to put – almost like a QC – whatever I privately feel.I’m interested in the idea of the official script. The complaint in The Absence of War is that Labour politicians “all have to say the same thing”. Is political theatre about departing from the script?DH: Yes – I never joined a party because, as a writer, you have to be free to investigate the thing itself. When you write about the Labour party, you are neither pro nor against, you’re just trying to describe the phenomenon. Your freedom is your power.JG: I’m not a member of a party, although I’ve started to question whether this is right. The state of the national conversation is depressingly poor and the stakes so high. You’ve only to look at the burning tower at Grenfell or what happened in the European referendum. I find myself sympathising when I watch squirming politicians on Andrew Marr’s Sunday show. They don’t have the freedom we have to interrogate properly, be curious, listen, respond. Our talking-point culture is so vacuous. The campaign Theresa May led was a flight from conversation. “Brexit means Brexit” was saying: “We cannot talk about this.” I was glad to see that kind of politicking fail. The British public rejected it.DH: It has become difficult for politicians. I went on the Today programme recently and the interviewer was terribly nice and assumed what I was going to say was interesting. They didn’t take up a hostile attitude because I’m a writer and it’s assumed I’m speaking the truth. But the minute they go to a political interview, they’re all over it, saying: why are you lying to me? That’s the assumption the politician has to endure. So there’s a conspiracy of distrust between the public and politicians – it’s not all one-sided.You each wrote five-minute films about Brexit. Is there more to be written about Brexit or are we suffering Brexit fatigue?JG: Brexit is going to be in the DNA of everything, including writing that is not about that vote. The Moderate Soprano, for example, is a metaphor for Englishness… And isn’t satire also essential to a dramatist’s armoury?DH: You have to have a joke. Jokes are clarifying. A good joke is what makes you realise what you think and feel. Yet I cannot explain why certain subjects attract me. It’s like understanding what is photogenic. The “dramagenic” is mysterious.What seems less mysterious is your preference for subjects about which people do not already know…DH: That’s why the current laundry list is of no interest to me. Everyone says: “Will you write about Trump? Will you write about Brexit?” And you just go: “Why would I?” Why would I be behind the dustcart instead of in front of it?You, DH, have been writing about Labour for more than 30 years. What has changed in Labour and what will your new play I’m Not Running reveal?DH: Like James’s Labour of Love, I’m Not Running is about a relationship between a man and a woman that has lasted 20 years, but, unlike James’s play, one of them is in the Labour party and the other isn’t and is trying to do good through a single issue. We’re licensed in society to admire people who fight on single issues, identity politics, people who stand for their own group, be they women, black, Jewish, Arab. If you stand for your group, you are an unalloyed hero. In joined-up party politics, it is harder to be a hero. I wanted to write about why positive feelings about politics are now principally focused on single issues. This seems to me the most interesting phenomenon of our time. And if any movement has had vitality in my lifetime, it has been feminism. In the western world, feminism has been the most transformative political movement.Rereading The Absence of War, I thought the description of George Jones could be applied to Jeremy Corbyn: “the man who made victory possible. But unless we do something quickly, he’s the only thing standing in victory’s way.”DH: They’re very different characters. Neil Kinnock, to make Labour electable, had to jettison a great deal of what he believed. Jeremy Corbyn’s views have not significantly changed about anything in the last 50 years and are not changing now under pressure. Trident is the exception – for party political, working-class vote reasons. Union reasons.In This House, politics itself, not policy, becomes the subject – something separate from what anyone believes…DH: This House is one of the best definitions of the process of politics I have ever seen.JG: It was surprising to realise what has to go on behind the scenes for the business of government to take place. What is the tone when what is openly unsaid is: “You are going to try and pass that law and I am going to try and stop you.”What makes you both angriest about the state of the nation?DH: The detention system. I was, in Collateral, trying to throw light on this unbelievable thing whereby, when you’re waiting for an appeal, you are held in a place of detention. The 300-400 women who are at Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre say: “We’re here and we don’t know when we’re going to get out.” At least in prison you know when you are going to get out. What also really gets me is camp – when people like Boris Johnson or Amber Rudd pretend not to understand what the problem is Rudd knew perfectly well there is no legal justification for these people to be held behind bars. And yet it is somehow meant to be the game that you camp it up. I remember Willie Whitelaw walking through Brixton after the riots, saying: “The police have done marvellously.” Right? And it was a catastrophic failure of police-community relations. There is this camping your way through everything. If you are totally incompetent, like Boris Johnson, or immoral like Amber Rudd… I am not amused by that joking in English behaviour – it makes me angry.JG: I’m not angry, I’m worried. I’ve mentioned the quality of national discourse and that extends to the way we speak to each other on social media, share ideas or don’t. I’m worried about the way we block each other. I wonder how solutions are going to materialise if the tribalism that seems to exist isn’t bridged. We’re all responsible.What role does social media play in political theatre?JG: Tech and technology are changing us emotionally and politically. We’re in a wild west period. We forget that the internet is really young, it is the equivalent of no lanes on roads, no seatbelts. We don’t know how to use it well enough. I’m sure our grandchildren will look back shocked and baffled that we didn’t wear the equivalent of seatbelts. I try not to get distracted by social media but it’s hard – because you want to be tuned in.DH: Do you?JG: I want to be tuned in to the current anxieties and obsessions.DH: But do you think you can read them on the internet?JG: No.DH: Do you feel social media presents an accurate reflection of the current state of things – I mean, the people you are talking about in Mansfield are not tweeting are they?JG: And they’re not on Instagram – that’s a good point. Yet Twitter must reveal something – especially given it now guides all political conversation in all media.What can political theatre do that political journalism can’t?JG: Journalism’s responsibility is to respond – quickly and urgently. The joy of writing a play is that you can take a bit longer, you can take a step back and ask a bigger question about what this means and why it matters and what it says about us that this is happening?DH: For people of my age, the plays Athol Fugard did with John Kani and Winston Ntshona were the best political theatre we ever saw. It was the sense that they had lived through what they were describing, so you felt, however erroneously, that you had some feeling of what it would have been like to be black and live under apartheid. I have never read a book or an article that has got anywhere near what those actors brought to their work. You were left shattered.Have either of you ever had your minds changed by a play?DH: I saw a David Mamet play that made me realise I’d been swindled in the street. I went: “Oh I see, it wasn’t out of the generosity of my heart that I gave that person $10, they swindled it out of me” – and now I understand the trick. This is what theatre does. It makes you open up and say: “I see because the model of what was happening has now been explained.”JG: Every play accesses a world of thought or opinion I wouldn’t have otherwise had access to, and I’m sure that changes me on a microscopic level… What have audiences taught you over the years?JG: You sit there as a writer and I think you can feel the moment when you just slightly lose an audience. The collective experience is hard to understand or define and hard to control. But you become very aware – as if the temperature had changed in the room and you just know… you might not know what the problem is, or how to fix it, but you know when it is there.Do you agree with that?DH: Yes, I’m hysterically aware and, in theory, committed to believing in the wisdom of the audience. It’s like democracy – they must make the right decisions. Yet sometimes you see some great masterpiece and the audience is bored stiff. And so audiences – whether they are wise or not – confuse me.Would either of you describe yourself as cynical or is it essential, as writers, to keep an open mind?JG: What I worry about for myself is that I can already feel myself being exhausted by the world.DH: The difference between what you’re describing and what I feel (I read your article about courtesy and the public discourse ) is that I was brought up to be adversarial. If you were brought up in the 60s, then you thought that the charade of British life was so ridiculous and you were against the Vietnam war, and it was such an outrage that you had to be adversarial in your thinking. When my generation of playwrights first went into the theatre, the critics tried to destroy us. They hated us. I had Bernard Levin on my case for 20 years. He ended one review saying: “I just wish David Hare would go away.” There was this feeling of these horrible young men are coming to take the theatre over and destroy it, whereas now when a young person writes a play, they’re welcomed – there is a feeling of: “It may not be very good, but I’ll give it three stars.” The new play culture is broadly approving.You have grumbled about “quietism” in our society now. What should replace it?DH: Things have changed a great deal. I share James’s fear of a predictable culture war in which everyone takes up adversarial positions that are crass. That I tend to attribute to social media I am afraid.JG: I absolutely agree. I perhaps overemphasise the desire to return to politeness and courtesy, but what I really feel is the fear of a retreat into simplicity and fake fundamentalism in political debate.Have you found politicians are willing to talk to you?DH: People will happily talk to playwrights because they know their views will not be attributed and so they can be honest and not just politicians – I am talking about people in all walks of life.Do politicians ever respond badly to your plays?DH: Oh yes.JG: All the time. Not about stuff that would excite me. People have complained about ties, shoes and wigs – I don’t think Michael Heseltine liked his wig in This House. But they’ve never come to me to say that I misrepresented their worldview.Have you had that?DH: Oh yes. I don’t think Jack Straw was a natural fan of Stuff Happens. In fact, there were a lot of politicians who were not fans of Stuff Happens.What is coming next, James?DH: Yes – what are the next three plays, James?!JG: The truth is, I actually don’t know – for the first time – and it is glorious.

Now we can all dip a toe in, writes Joanne O’Connor, who tries it out in NorfolkOne pine tree looks very much like another. This is my first thought as I wander into the forest looking for a tree to “connect with”. When I find this special tree, I’ve been instructed to greet it like an old friend, to share what’s on my mind, maybe even give it a hug. I’m hoping to find a gnarly old oak, a mournful willow perhaps, but this is a plantation forest, the arboreal equivalent of “Pines R Us”. Oh well. This one will do. Self-consciously, I wrap my arms around a spindly sapling. We both know it’s not right, but the clock is ticking. And then I spot it, glowing in the bosky gloom – a ghostly silver birch. I make my excuses – “Sorry, I’ve just seen a better tree over there” – and make my way over to the birch. As I get closer I notice that its papery bark is covered in some kind of green fungus. I look around. I’ve lost sight of the rest of the group and my allocated 10 minutes are up. It occurs to me that this is some kind of clunky metaphor for my life: I’ve spent so long looking for the perfect tree that I’ve run out of time.When I eventually rejoin the rest of the group, our guide invites us to share any insights gained from our tree encounter while passing around a pine cone. One of the women describes feeling a profound sense of peace. I decide not to share that none of the trees were good enough for me.Forest bathing is the latest health and wellbeing craze to hit the UK. An import from Japan, it’s been greeted with equal parts enthusiasm and scepticism, much like sushi when it first arrived on British shores. No swimming is involved the bathing part simply means using all of your senses to soak up the special atmosphere of the forest. And it’s big. From self-help books to Center Parcs (which has incorporated forest-bathing principles into its new Sherwood Forest spa), the healing power of trees is suddenly everywhere. The Forestry Commission, which manages almost 1m hectares of woodland in England, plans to launch a nationwide forest-bathing programme next year. And even city dwellers can get their tree fix with guided forest-bathing “experiences” popping up in parks from London to New York.But isn’t this just a marketing ploy to repackage the simple notion of going for a walk in the woods as a new alternative therapy? Apparently not. Japan is the most densely populated country on earth, with correspondingly high stress levels. It’s also one of the most heavily forested. In the 1980s the Japanese government carried out extensive scientific research which found that a two-hour forest-bathing session could reduce blood pressure, lower cortisol levels and improve concentration and memory. Their findings went beyond the usual correlations between fresh air, exercise and wellbeing. They found that the chemicals released by trees, known as phytoncides, could have an anti-microbial effect on our bodies, boosting the immune system. As a result of this research, forest bathing, or shinrin-yoku, was introduced as a national health programme.The first designated forest-bathing location was the beautiful Akasawa forest in Nagano prefecture on the old Samurai Trail, where groves of Japanese cypress trees tower 35m high. I’m trying it out in Thorpe Forest in Norfolk, just a few miles from Thetford, on the Dad’s Army trail (the TV series was famously filmed in and around the town). Forest Holidays, which offers accommodation in luxury woodland cabins at 10 locations around the UK, was among the first in the UK to spot the trend’s potential. Alongside more conventional ranger-led woodland activities, guests and day visitors to its Norfolk and Hampshire sites can now book a three-hour guided forest-bathing experience.“This is not a hike, it’s not exercise, it’s not a nature walk,” explains our ranger Charlie, who attended an eight-day residential course in France to qualify as a forest-therapy guide. “It’s much closer to mindfulness.” She leads our small group to a large clearing in the forest and invites us to close our eyes and awaken our senses, feeling the ground beneath our feet, inhaling the scent of pine and listening to the wind in the trees. It’s the first of a series of “invitations”, or gentle guided meditations, which are designed to quieten the mind and deepen our connection with our surroundings.Charlie calls the next exercise “What’s in motion?” This involves walking very slowly and attentively through the forest and noting the things that are growing or moving around us. It proves surprisingly difficult. My preferred way of being outdoors is to go for a long, strenuous walk. To creep along at a snail’s pace, noticing every leaf that quivers, is a challenge and I find my mind strays and my pace involuntarily picks up. But eventually the stillness of the forest on this cold spring day starts to work its magic. I slow down. I stare at the hypnotic swaying of the pines. Charlie spots a muntjac disappearing into the undergrowth. The spell is unceremoniously broken by a blast of Snow Patrol from the portable speakers of a group of teenagers marching past on some kind of adventure training exercise. Then it’s time for our “meet a tree” bonding session (enlightening) and Charlie asks us to finish by getting into pairs and swapping stories about trees that have meant something to us. The session ends with a Japanese tea ceremony – the tea infused with foraged nettles, pine needles or blackberries depending on the time of year – the first cup being offered to the forest as a way of giving thanks.The day finishes with my own interpretation of forest bathing – a long twilight soak in the hot tub on my cabin deck with a glass of wine, staring up at the trees above. After a long winter – most of which was spent huddled in front of a computer screen, or scurrying, head down, between the school run, train station and office – it feels like the first time in months that I’ve actually taken a deep breath, allowed my shoulders to drop and just enjoyed the feeling of being outside. Call it shinrin-yoku, forest bathing, a walk in the woods, call it whatever you like, but it feels good.A three-night stay in a Forest Holidays Silver Birch cabin with hot tub, sleeping four, costs from £610.

So many cold cases are being re-examined by broadcasters that any hitherto unspotted did-he-or-didn’t-he women-killers must feel left out. There can barely be one out there that hasn’t been interrogated – or, at least, mythologised – by a fry-vocalled, mic-wielding intellectual.Anyhow. There’s no denying that this next podcast has death as its theme. The Making of a Massacre (told you) is a new AudibleProPublica production, featuring Pulitzer prize winning journalist Ginger Thompson, exploring what led up to the 2011 mass killings in Allende, Mexico. Thompson herself grew up in Texas, near the border with Mexico, and she understands that there is not much that ides the people on one side of the border from the other. In the first episode, she describes Eagle Pass, in Texas, and Allende, in Mexico – just 40 minutes’ drive apart – as rancher towns. She emphasises their similarities: “The people are almost the same … Everyone on one side of the border has family on the other side of the border. I didn’t meet anyone who didn’t in all the months I reported there … The people in Allende, Mexico, shop on the weekends at the mall in Eagle Pass, Texas. The people in Eagle Pass go to the dentist or buy their meat in Mexico because it’s cheaper. They’re crossing the border all the time.”What Thompson and the podcast argue – very convincingly – is that it was a US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) decision (“a deadly miscalculation”) that directly sparked the mass murder of many innocent citizens of the Mexican town. The DEA was on the trail of the terrifying drug kingpins who controlled Allende’s narcotics business and managed to get the phone numbers of the two brothers at the top, via one of the brothers’ associates. But the brothers got wind that one of their own had betrayed them, and so they rounded up suspects, as well as random locals who got in the way, then shot them and burned their remains. The Allende law enforcers did not step in to stop the murders and hundreds of Allende people died. And how did the drug leaders know they were under investigation? Because the US DEA had contacted the notoriously leaky Mexican police force and told them that they were. This, after the DEA were warned specifically not to do this. The massacre was the result.God, this is incredibly depressing stuff. But Ginger Thompson is great, and the story is told well. There are many interviews with Allende locals, done in Spanish and then voiced by English-speaking actors. And the podcast is a necessary one: no authorities in Mexico have ever been held to account, and Trump is spouting his usual OTT rubbish about going in hard on other Mexican drug cartels. I recommend The Making of a Massacre, if you’re of a type who doesn’t take such terrible stories to heart. I could only do this podcast in small doses.If you like small-dose podcasts, then you may well enjoy Double Bubble, the five-part drama series about prison life that came out on Monday to Friday last week. Produced by the Prison Radio Association, in association with Stop Loan Sharks, Double Bubble is written and voiced by ex-prisoner Carl Cattermole. It tells the story of a man in prison forced, through tricky circumstances, to borrow money off one of the scariest inmates. He has to pay back twice what he borrowed (“double bubble”). Everything goes wrong, as you might expect. This is a great story but it’s very short: each episode, other than the final one, is only around four minutes long (Friday’s stretches to seven). You’d think it would be hard to tell a gripping tale in such a brief time but Cattermole manages it. If I were a telly company, I’d snap up this story, add another couple of threads and make it into a TV series.You, Me and the Big CbbcThree immensely empathetic and upbeat young women tell of their lives with cancer.

As polling day has drawn nearer, however, it has become increasingly likely that the result will reaffirm the status quo of a powerful, elite-run patronage network with entrenched channels of influence.For opponents of prime minister Saad Hariri’s government, this spells trouble. “The country is going through serious social, economic and political challenges that will translate into disastrous consequences if the same elite runs the country, with the same mindset that it did the last 30 years,” said Gilbert Doumit, a candidate in Beirut for a new list, Kulna Watani. A complicated electoral law drafted for the vote was supposed to give more room for plurality and merit-based candidates to emerge in a political scene that has taken root around civil war-era former warlords and sectarian leaders. Established political blocs, however, rather than newcomers, look set to benefit from the high threshold required to win a seat.The result could continue to marginalise candidates standing on civil society platforms. One such campaign, Beirut Madinati, emerged during municipal elections three years ago but has since made little impact away from the capital. Lebanon’s large working class population remains wedded to the traditional structures, analysts say. That means a showdown, in some form, between two rival blocs that emerged after the assassination of the former prime minister Rafiq Hariri in February 2005. Dubbed March 8 – a pro-Syria and Hezbollah movement – and March 14 – a pro-western counterpart – the two movements have dominated Lebanese politics ever since.March 14 was briefly ascendant until 2008, despite more than a dozen of its loyalists, including MPs, journalists, and security officials, being killed. Since then, the powerful Hezbollah has dominated Lebanese affairs. The reluctance of political rivals to challenge the group in any other forum but a national poll is testament to its power.“For many in Lebanon, the salons of leaders’ palaces are the gateway to the state,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, the communications director of the Carnegie Middle East centre in Beirut. “In the case of Hezbollah, this process takes the form of a network of institutions, hospitals, schools, higher education institutes, religious seminaries, social services and publishing. “The party is the country’s largest publisher, and the second largest employer after the state. So when we talk of a challenge by independents and civil society to the state in this elections, we have to bear in mind that fair competition is non-existent, and the caps on spending don’t apply to the big players, who either draw on the government’s resources, or regional funding to maintain their large and effective networks.“The power of the Lebanese political elite, comprised of former warlords and sectarian leaders, is based on the client-list networks. Basically, the sectarian leaders take on the functions of the state, mostly through its institutions, providing public jobs and services to their constituencies.”After five years of self-imposed exile, the figurehead of March 14, Saad Hariri, returned to Lebanon in late 2016 to form a government. That led to the election of a president, the March 8 icon Michel Aoun, who partnered Hezbollah and won the group’s endorsement. Ever since, the country has been perceived to have been in the orbit of March 8 – informally allied to Iran, and on slowly warming ties with Syria despite a formal policy of disassociation.In late 2017 Saudi leaders, who until then had been Hariri’s patrons, summoned the prime minister to Riyadh and told him to resign. They had taken umbrage at what they saw as Iranian consolidation under his new government – a sign of just how sensitive the fragile state is to regional dynamics and what little room it has to manoeuvre by itself, even if it tried. Once back in Lebanon, Hariri announced he was suspending the resignation he had tendered while in Saudi Arabia and, aside from that chapter, his return has brought relative stability to the country. It has done little, however, to address rampant corruption, nepotism and soaring national debt. Almost all public services remain poor, and there is popular resentment at festering piles of rubbish and regular power cuts.“The powerful remain committed to this electricity debacle because they are invested in the current system,” one senior political figure said. “They are running diesel through gas plants. There are kickbacks involved.”Hage Ali said that current levels of corruption and inefficiency were not sustainable but that “the status quo is not capable of reforming itself”.Doumit, the Julna Watani candidate, said: “If the same political elite and their allies are all re-elected, then the status quo will mean a continuation of unacceptable electricity cuts, lack of a reliable water supply, and a very poor waste management system that leaves garbage rotting in the streets. “Whatever the outcome, we will continue fighting to achieve proper representation and accountability mechanisms that the Lebanese people deserve.”Fouad Makhzoumi, a Sunni candidate and potential rival to Hariri, said: “If change doesn’t happen, Lebanon has a bleak future. My feeling is that this election will start the process, but it needs another election to truly put the country on a new path.”Daniella Daou, a 21-year-old political science graduate, said civil society candidates still stood to make an impact, even if they failed to win seats. “With the exposure they get now, they will probably have influence as lobby groups. The electoral districts, though, have been drawn to fit the warlords.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78fc0f94d13087d631c726987362f74f1eafe4a8/0_264_5172_3102/master/5172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f499b8d88103ef50d1a5ee40526806e","title":"ban non disclosure deals says nicky morgan tory mp","story":"New laws should be considered to stop non-disclosure agreements being used to silence the victims of sexual harassment and punish those who abuse their power, a former Conservative cabinet minister has\u0026nbspsaid.Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary and women’s minister, said the time had come to ask if new powers were needed to tackle harassment as part of Theresa May’s pledge to tackle the “burning injustices” in\u0026nbspBritain.It follows a series of scandals that have hit Hollywood, Westminster and other institutions. Film mogul Harvey Weinstein was toppled by a string of allegations, while two cabinet ministers also lost their jobs over inappropriate behaviour. Other MPs are still facing allegations.Meanwhile, the Nobel prize for literature has been postponed this year in the wake of sexual assault allegations connected to the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize.Writing as part of a new cross-party essay collection on injustice, published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity and the Bright Blue thinktank, Morgan said women in Britain still face “unjustifiable\u0026nbspbarriers”.“The Office for National Statistics Crime Survey for 2016-17 showed that one in five women in the UK has experienced some kind of sexual assault,” she writes. “In England and Wales, in 2015-16, there were 4,094 sex discrimination cases taken to an employment tribunal.“And, horrifically, in spite of a long list of criminal offences outlawing domestic violence, two women a week are killed by their current or former partners in England and Wales.“Laws have been passed to clamp down on sexual harassment, abuse and stalking, yet projects such as ‘Everyday Sexism’ record the deliberate and casual misogyny which girls and women still have to put up with. In many cases, harassment happens because powerful men take advantage of their status to harass women they work with. Is it time for an ‘abuse of power’ offence? Could whistleblowing protections be extended to those who call out harassment? Should non-disclosure agreements in such situations be outlawed?”A series of allegations made against MPs has seen Westminster caught up in the issue. Charlie Elphicke, the Tory MP for Dover and Deal, was suspended from the Conservative party in November and was interviewed under caution by police in March after allegations of sex offences. He denies the claims.Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary last November after admitting his past behaviour had “fallen short”. Damian Green lost his job as first secretary after admitting he lied about the fact that pornogrpahic images were found on his Commons computer.Meanwhile, the speaker John Bercow is facing allegations that he bullied members of his staff – an allegation he denies.In her essay, Morgan calls on her party to champion equality and warns it against being “suspicious of calls for equality of outcome”.“Even now, this Conservative government is proposing that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which includes sections on equality and prohibiting all forms of discrimination, does not need to continue to be an explicit part of UK law after Brexit,” she writes.“Gender discrimination starts early. So, there must be a more explicit focus on it within the education system. In the same way that we need more male primary school teachers, we need more female head teachers: more flexible working patterns in our schools and colleges is essential.”She also calls for more rights for women going through the menopause. “Many health conditions faced by women now, happily, attract fierce attention and widespread support. Breast cancer, for example, receives significant levels of funding.“But there are still issues – for example, early screening for ovarian cancer or tackling the taboos around the menopause – which need greater focus. Every woman goes through the menopause, but are affected differently, some very negatively. Women should not have to face inconsistent support from employers during what can be a very difficult time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9cc2ffd64603abd569e360f21a91b46d8ac3a20/0_126_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2045dcb85a51db40de652208340a7560","title":"liverpools mohamed salah an egyptian hero for the 21st century","story":"In Nagrig, the footballer’s birthplace, his generosity and rise to fame are inspiring a generation of new sports starsThe village where Mohamed Salah grew up is a cluster of red-brick houses threaded together by dusty unpaved streets and surrounded by a shimmering sea of green fields. In its centre, Ahmed al-Masery sits in an empty coffee shop watching highlights on a tiny, wall-hung TV of his old friend playing for Liverpool against Roma. “I used to play football games on PlayStation with him back in the day,” says the 35-year-old, gesturing at the screen.Back then, Salah would pick Liverpool to play video games with his friend. Now the player is the Merseyside club’s favourite adopted son, a striker whose goals have inspired his team into the Champions League final later this month. Fans are devoted to their “Egyptian king” – one song includes the line “if he scores another few, I’ll be Muslim too”.For the people of Nagrig, a small farming community two buses and a train-ride north of Cairo, Salah’s rise is scarcely believable. The 25-year-old comes back to the village about once a year, al-Masery says, but he’s been totally unspoilt by fame. “He doesn’t even drive when he comes here,” he says. “He walks around the streets like everyone else, speaking to anyone who wants to talk to him.”Much has been made in the Egyptian press of Salah’s charity work. It’s been widely reported that he regularly helps newlyweds furnish their new homes with everything they need for marriage, although the recipients of these gifts have never come out publicly. Newspaper columnists and talk-show hosts delight in sharing examples like these of Salah’s good nature, but al-Masery is one of many Nagrig residents who are sceptical. “Most of these stories are just hearsay,” he says. One particularly popular Salah story came after LE 30,000 (£1,250) was stolen from Salah’s father. The thief was caught and in act of forgiveness, Salah’s family did not press charges. Retellings of the story in the press, however, have Salah intervening personally to help the man find work. One version even has Salah giving the man a wad of cash.“The media just wants to talk about Salah, Salah, Salah,” al-Masery says. “He’s a nice guy, and very respectful, but not everything written about him is true.”Not everybody shares al-Masery’s scepticism about the Salah story. In Cairo, where 200 punters crammed onto the pavement at an outdoor coffee shop to watch Liverpool secure their place in the Champion’s League final, 29-year-old football fan Omar Salem says he “doesn’t care” if certain details about the striker are false. “People want to believe these things about him,” he says. “At this point he’s so loved that nobody would ever deny them.”Before last July, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone here supporting the Merseyside club. That’s all changed this season, though, with football fans regularly turning out in force, for every Liverpool game. “It would just be amazing to have an Egyptian player win the Champion’s League,” Salem says.Salem says it was Egypt’s match against Congo in October that marked the beginning of his status as a national icon. Salah’s penalty, four minutes into injury time, put Egypt ahead at the 11th hour, securing the team a place in its first World Cup in 28 years. “When he celebrated that goal,” says Salem, “that’s the image people will remember from that match.”Salem calls Salah the first big Egyptian player “that people can actually relate to”. “We don’t even know what car he drives,” says Salem. Instead, Salah’s story is that of a humble teenager, who through sheer grit and determination earned the chance to represent his country in the big leagues of Europe.For the kids of Nagrig, at least, the legend of Mohamed Salah is very real. His former school was renamed in his honour, and to talk to pupils here, you’d think his story was part of the curriculum. One such pupil, 13-year-old Osama Eid, tells the story of Salah’s rise to fame as if reciting his 12-times-tables. “He’s very respectful and kind,” he says, “and well-mannered and does a lot of work to help the poor.” According to Eid’s friends, he’s the best footballer of their gang. When asked if he’d like to be like Salah one day, he doesn’t skip a beat: “Inshallah.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5325058944c25af852069a5acc8c75f527c375c9/0_43_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0895e1345e570bb0fc1cc556db4c851a","title":"qatar blockade unexpected new vision isolation","story":"Enforced isolation has given the emirate confidence to pursue a political and cultural rebootFor most of the past year the city-state of Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatar’s closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf state’s role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade.Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were erted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatar’s sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics – 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.The stated aim for the blockade – which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands – was a protest against what was seen as Qatar’s singular role in “funding terrorism” (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded.Far from destabilising Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an “us against the world” authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capital’s six-lane corniche.Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis’ stated goal has been to create a erse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money – and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup – solves only some of those skills shortages.“It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work,” she said. “But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.”Qatar’s modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hind’s parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of “Education City” and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation.From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen “partner universities” that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A\u0026ampM for engineering, and so on.The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaas’s idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the children’s library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once.Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim.There is a blatant “look at us” attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard – and splashing out ostentatiously on the world’s most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezanne’s The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power.That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down.The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeera’s reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Doha’s ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates.The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estate’s role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that “there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it – the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here”.Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions).There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN.In the dean’s view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City.In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural ide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis?“I won’t lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade,” Sheikha Hind says, “absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it – whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in.” She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, “if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now.” The goal has not changed, she suggests, “but now we are running rather than walking”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475796.1524775142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"skylarks stunned me just like the poets the bird has hoisted into verse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe lark ascending: the skylark has hoisted countless poets into verse. Illustration: Michael VineyMy first encounter with a singing skylark, a few decades ago, put me flat on my back on the moss of the dunes – a proper posture for awe.The bird had sprung, as larks do, almost from under my feet and spiralled up to hang as a speck in the clear air, pouring out a ceaseless flow of whistlings and trillings that seemed to stun the whole hillside into listening. They certainly stunned me, just like the countless poets the skylark has hoisted into verse.One could look to science (flight up to 100m, wings fluttering at 10 to 12 beats a second, sonagram with up-and-down pitch pattern between 2kHz and 5.5kHz over about six seconds, average song up to two or three minutes but can go on for six). Or could simply settle for Shelley: “Higher still and higher  From the earth thou springest . . . And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.”A lot more is assembled online by a sensitive American blogger, who didn’t, one gathers, vote for Trump. There are further from Cecil Day-Lewis (“Be strong your fervent soaring, your skyward air!  Tremble there, a nerve of song!”) and a typically ecstatic tongue-twister from Gerard Manley Hopkins (“Left hand, off land, I hear the lark ascend,  His rash-fresh re-winded new skeinèd score  In crisps of curl off wild winch whirl, and pour  And pelt music, till none’s to spill or spend”).Ted Hughes, whose skylark may have soared in Connemara, is predictably darker: “The lark begins to go up  Like a warning  As if the globe were uneasy . . .  You stop to rest, far up, you teeter  Over the drop . . .  Then up and up and up  Like a mouse with drowning fur  Bobbing and bobbing at the well-wall”.The globe is indeed uneasy, as one in eight of its bird species is threatened with extinction. As farming intensifies, Europe’s skylarks are down by almost half, and in Ireland by 30 per cent, since 1970.It is no longer breeding in many parts of the south and east, its nesting retreating to the uplands and coastal margins and islands. On the grassy machair behind the dunes, below me, Michael Longley has pictured the spring tide “seeping after sun and moon  To pour cupfuls into the larks’ nests”.An English skylark researcher, Eric Simms, a sound recordist as well as ornithologist, began all this more than half a century ago. He organised the synchronised recording, in early June 1951, of the spread of the dawn chorus across the UK.Skylarks anticipated the rise in light as it rolled across these islands from northeast to southwest. Their first song was recorded at 01.30 GMT in Scotland’s Cairngorms, 01.51 in Northumberland, 02.20 in Kent, 02.27 in Staffordshire, 02.28 in Co Antrim, 02.33 in Lancashire (a bit late in industrial haze) and 02.36 in south Wales.At RTÉ Derek Mooney and his Mooney Goes Wild team of experts pioneered the broadcasting of the Irish dawn chorus some two decades ago, then extended live transmission across Europe through links with other presenters as far as Russia.In 2016 this triumphant capture of the exquisite avian sound, with human commentary in a murmur of national accents, won the programme the Rose d’Or award for the European radio event of the year. Tomorrow’s dawn chorus will track the songs of myriad species, from the tropics to the tundra, in their first welcome to the day.For some of Ireland’s skylarks, meanwhile, there is promise of a better future. In the Bride Valley of east Cork – where, I’m told, the bird is “just hanging on in pockets here and there” – a five-year pilot project has been launched to reward tillage and dairy farmers for actions encouraging wildlife.In the logo of the new Bride Project (“Farming with Nature”) a skylark is poised above bands of green and gold, denoting the grass and cornfields that comprise its ideal habitat. Farm management plans will offer the birds patches of ungrazed pasture to nest in, and unsprayed stubble fields for winter feed.A Scottish skylark researcher, Diane Hendry, wrote an anxious poem about her job: “I worry that skylarks have been expelled,  become dissident birds.  I try to pretend they are simply out  of fashion, like Shelley  but secretly I am afraid  they have been hushed up”.In Bride Valley, let’s hope, they’ll soon be back in full number, and “soaring ever singest”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485811.1525537135!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i struggled with knowing who ann s baby s father might be","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnn Lovett: died after giving birth at the age of 15, in 1984. Photograph © The The daughter of Ann Lovett’s boyfriend has said the silence surrounding her death has been “an enormous burden on so many people”.Vicky Langan, the daughter of Richard McDonnell, said she “struggled with the weight of knowing who the father of Ann’s baby might be but was paralysed by it”.In a public Facebook post Ms Langan said she accidentally came across private correspondence belonging to her mother “that referred to my estranged father’s relationship with Ann Lovett”, along with a description of Ann’s death, two years before Ms Langan was born. “From then on, if I saw Ann’s name printed in a newspaper, my heart raced and my palms would sweat. I was overwhelmed with guilt, sadness and a profound shame.”Ms Langan said the more she researched Ann’s death, “the more I became convinced of some manner of a cover-up”. “I struggled with the weight of knowing who Ann’s baby’s father might be but was paralysed by it. I was unable to process or suppress the contemplation of the senseless loss of Ann’s life, the tragic, lonely stillbirth of what might have been my half-brother, the suffocating atmosphere of the town closing ranks, the silence.”On April 22nd, 1984, less than three months after Ann died, her sister Patricia, aged 14, died by suicide. “The silence surrounding this horrific tragedy has been an enormous burden on so many people,” Ms Langan said. “Three lives ended in a state of unthinkable desperation, and the trauma that stayed with those who cared about Ann and Patricia fuelled endless cycles of depression, alcoholism, self-harm, violence, self-destructive behaviour and sadly, suicides.“Remains and after-effects of this trauma have embedded themselves into the generation that followed Ann’s and my father’s. I have not yet begun to find a way to rid myself of this unshakeable sadness, this internal rage in all directions.“I am sure there are other young people my age connected to those in Granard who feel the same.”“I want to thank Rosita Boland for her important reporting on this story and for her kindness and sensitivity over the past few weeks.

Photograph: David Sleator Bertie Ahern’s haunts are mostly still the same: Croke Park, Parnell Park – the home of Dublin GAA – and some pubs around the north side of Dublin where he toured throughout his political career.Yet some slight differences have emerged in the habits of the former taoiseach since he stood down from office a decade ago.Despite occasional appearances in Fagan’s – the Drumcondra pub which has framed pictures and newspaper clippings of Ahern and Bill Clinton toasting each other on its walls – he is said to no longer be a regular, but may occasionally make an appearance.“The lads behind the bar say it: ‘Never comes in anymore’,” said a local source. “He was last spotted there on All-Ireland final day.”A hostile atmosphere during the worst years of the recession perhaps encouraged Ahern to be cautious in where he socialises. He is now said to favour the discreet bar in the soccer club Home Farm. “The place would be empty – seven or eight people – but the Bert will be in there,” said another local. “I think he uses it for privacy.”The Goose Tavern and the Beaumont House still count on his regular custom, usually with old friends who have remained “100 per cent” loyal, according to those who know them.But – after years in which Bertie Ahern was viewed as something of a pariah – those around north Dublin detect a renewed confidence in Ahern as his reputation has improved. “When you see him coming out of Parnell Park now, there is a pep in his step even compared to two years ago. His head is held up high, he has a bit of the swagger back.”His interventions on Northern Ireland issues and Brexit have helped to rehabilitate him, although a recent interview with German television – which he walked out of when questions turned to the Mahon tribunal and his stewardship of the economy – served as a reminder that the most contentious issues of his past have not gone away.Speaking to The , Ahern himself says most criticism of him by members of the public in the years after his retirement mostly centred on the economy. “In the heat of the recession in 2009 and 2010, people would say: ‘If you had have done this or that’.” Issues around the tribunal, he says, are raised with him “very, very rarely”.Friends say a “bit of pride” meant Ahern was reluctant to discuss how his reputation had been damaged. “Even during the height of the recession, and at the peak of when he was getting stick, if you asked him about that, he’d never really admit it,” said one.But one particular memory from his days at the tribunal in Dublin Castle lingers around north Dublin, and will not be easily forgotten.The intricacies of his personal finances – aside from an easily mocked claim that he won significant sums betting on horses – have largely passed beyond common memory, but the treatment of Gráinne Carruth has not.Carruth, Ahern’s former constituency secretary who broke down while giving evidence about lodging thousands of pounds in sterling for her former boss, now lives with her family in a renovated St Luke’s, the former taoiseach’s Drumcondra base which she bought in 2015.“Even when people see him talking about Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement you’d still hear: ‘What about Gráinne Carruth and what he did to her?’” said a local.Ahern still keeps an office in Drumcondra, in modest rooms in a small business park. Most meetings are held across the road in the lobby or bar of the Skylon Hotel.He has been busy since leaving office. He briefly took to the after-dinner-speaking circuit and was on the boards of a few private sector companies but has largely focused on the area of conflict resolution, where his achievements are beyond dispute.Such pro bono work includes: spells with the World Economic Forum’s advisory group on conflict resolution the Clinton Global Initiative as a facilitator with Crisis Management Initiative, which saw him taking part in peace talks in Ukraine the Inter Mediate group established by Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief adviser and a period as co-chair of the InterAction Council of former world leaders.Ahern has also formed associations with various academic institutions including receiving an honorary professorship from NUI Maynooth. This week, he was in the Basque Country to mark the end of Eta, another step in a peace process to which he, along with others such as Gerry Adams, contributed.Recently, he has also been asked by the United Nations to chair Bougainville’s referendum commission ahead of a vote next year on whether the region should be independent of Papau New Guinea. Back home, he has helped settle disputes between the GAA and organisations in north Dublin.But Ahern’s standing within Fianna Fáil – he resigned his membership in 2012 in advance of a move to expel him because of the findings of the Mahon tribunal – remains a pebble in his shoe.His possible re-entry into the party was raised as recently as last Wednesday night at a Dublin Central Comhairle Dáil Ceantair meeting. According to sources, an elderly delegate said that in order to secure a Dáil seat for Mary Fitzpatrick, the current Dublin Central candidate who clashed with Ahern on numerous occasions, the party should recruit all the help it could get, including allowing Ahern back.Ahern was sounded out about the prospect but cautioned against opening up such a contentious issue at this point. Micheál Martin shot down a similar proposal in November 2016, but many in the party would take Ahern back in a heartbeat.Last month, at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil national executive, talk turned to the prospect of the party standing a candidate in the presidential election – if there is to be one – later this year.Der Walsh, the delegate for Martin’s own Cork South Central constituency, told his leader that if the party is serious about standing for the presidency, it should send for Ahern. Unsurprisingly, Martin didn’t address the question.The current Fianna Fáil leader has a strained relationship with Ahern, who in turn finds it difficult to mask his dislike for the man he first appointed to Cabinet in 1997.Ahern’s occasional flirtations with a run for the presidency may be designed to cause trouble for Martin, or are a way of keeping his name connected with the Phoenix Park, in the off-chance that events turn his way.But friends insist he just wants his views on politics respected within the party he gave 40 years to. “I think he’d like to do the same around the party as he does with Brexit and the North,” says a friend, “to give advice”.“I don’t think he wants to run for office again. He was 40-odd years a member of the party. Most of his friends and most of his life has been around the party. I think he’d love to be of help. He doesn’t want to be on the frontline.”Ahern himself says: “If I was still in Fianna Fáil, the only thing I’d be doing would be in the local cumann.”To those around Ahern, the recent celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement offered the perfect opportunity for Martin to make a generous gesture of rapprochement.While Martin praised Ahern’s contributions to the peace process, it was felt that Fianna Fáil was attempting to claim credit for its achievements while continuing to disown one of its chief architects.“I have heard people in Fianna Fáil say: ‘We are the party of the Good Friday Agreement.’ You know Yeats’s famous line, how do you separate the dancer from the dance? Well, they are trying to do that.”As to when Ahern could return to Fianna Fáil fold, one supporter is blunt: “As soon as your man from Cork is gone.”All who encounter Ahern testify to his ongoing, intense interest in politics, from constituency level upwards.While he “f***ing hates Micheál Martin”, said one in regular contact with him, he is said to have a regard for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. “He sees Leo as the same style of politician as himself.”“Bert still has the glint in his eye, the word for all the auld ones: ‘How yis doin girls? That type of thing.’ He still has a great grá for the day job. You get the impression he really misses it.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483261.1525444227!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"judging bertie ahern we all partied but he served the drinks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBertie Ahern: will his achievements be eclipsed by his shortcomings?

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Another coalition government of most parties that have ruled since 2016 is likelySeveral \u0026lsquofirsts\u0026rsquo in the Middle East country\u0026rsquos first parliamentary election in nine yearsPalestinians gather for sixth March of Return protestMahmoud Abbas suggests Jews not persecuted on religious grounds, but because of their conductWashington risks conflict with Russia and Iran, President Assad\u0026rsquos chief backersDrive to push out terror group was halted in January when Turkey began Afrin offensiveEleven children killed in further attack on foreign forces in south of AfghanistanThrough the dark days of the 1990s civil war and the Taliban\u0026rsquos oppressive rule, Shah Marai never left his countryAction by human rights groups follows deaths of 44 protesters on Gaza borderMove comes in wake of unclaimed missile strikes on Syrian air bases on SundayUS secretary of state reassures Riyadh that US will abandon Iran nuclear deal if talks failResidents have been staging protests since March seeking right of return for refugeesAs he was snatched from his village by Islamic State, Jano\u0026rsquos mother handed him a piece of paper that would save himDonors\u0026rsquo conference clocked just over half of the \u0026euro6.5bn needed to help Syria in 2018Ahmed Abu Hussein worked for Al-Shaab radio and had protective vest marked \u0026lsquoPress\u0026rsquoGovernment U-turn after no African country willing to accept migrants on Israel\u0026rsquos termsHassan Rouhani says US president lacks qualifications to assess nuclear dealDamascus Letter: Residents alternate between \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquowar normal\u0026rsquo livesIsis focus on Arab world may starve western intelligence as affiliate groups go dormantMany children reportedly among dead and injured in attack on party in isolated village"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485857.1525588124!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lebanon votes in first general election in nine years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man casts his vote at a polling station in Sidon, Lebanon. Photograph: REUTERSAli HashishoLebanese began voting on Sunday in their first general election for nine years. The poll is seen as unlikely to upend the country’s basic contours of power but is important for economic stability.Lebanon has mostly weathered the regional storm caused by seven years of war in neighbouring Syria that has drawn in regional powers and unleashed a wave of refugees, but it has gone through several internal crises since the last election.Television broadcasts showed voters queuing at polling stations across the tiny Mediterranean country to cast their ballots under new voting rules that still preserve the country’s sectarian power-sharing system.Voting is scheduled to last from 7am until 7pm, with unofficial results expected to start coming in overnight and a formal tally announced in the coming days.Election law makes it illegal to publish forecasts of how the parties will perform. Whatever the result, another coalition government including most of the major parties, like that which has governed since 2016, is likely to be formed after the election, analysts have said.Analysts are closely watching the performance of Sunni Muslim prime minister Saad al-Hariri’s Future Movement party and that of the Iran-backed, ShiaHizbullah group and its allies.The country has periodically been an arena for the intense regional competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia. However, in this election, Riyadh has pulled back from its previous support for Mr Hariri, backing that helped Future in 2009.Getting a new government in place quickly would reassure investors of Lebanon’s economic stability after donors pledged $11 billion in soft loans for a capital investment programme last month, in return for fiscal and other reforms. Lebanon has one of the world’s highest debt-to-GDP ratios and the International Monetary Fund has warned its fiscal trajectory is unsustainable.Despite some acts of violence and intimidation connected to the election in recent weeks, no major incidents were reported in the immediate run-up to voting.However, there was a security presence in Beirut on Sunday and a Reuters witness saw a long military column of armoured vehicles and other troop carriers driving slowly into the capital.

Photograph: Toby MelvillePA WireBritish prime minister Theresa May has insisted she had the “determination to deliver Brexit” as she came under pressure from both wings of the Tory party to change course.Eurosceptics urged Ms May to drop the proposal for a “customs partnership”, which they fear would tie the United Kingdom too closely to Brussels.But pro-EU Tories pushed for Ms May to abandon her red lines and keep the United Kingdom in the single market, claiming she would have cross-party support in the House of Commons for such a move.Elsewhere, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also risked unrest within his party over Labour’s position on Brexit ahead of a Lords vote on the issue.Writing in the Sun On Sunday, Ms May said she had an “absolute determination to make a success of Brexit, by leaving the single market and customs union and building a new relationship with EU partners that takes back control of our borders, our laws and our money”.She said the United Kingdom was “making good progress towards that goal and we will carry on doing so with resolution in the months ahead”.A decision on the Government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after Mrs May’s Brexit “war cabinet” failed to reach agreement.A number of Cabinet ministers spoke out against the Ms May’s hybrid “customs partnership” model that would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods destined for the block, with firms potentially claiming back a rebate if products remained in the United Kingdom on a lower-tariff regime.The Sunday  quoted a Cabinet source saying it would be “unimaginable for the prime minister to press on with the hybrid model after it has been torn apart by members of her own Brexit committee”.However, pro-EU Tories, seeking to capitalise on the lack of agreement in the Cabinet and a Lords victory on the customs union, pushed for Ms May to abandon her Brexit strategy and instead commit to a Norway-style approach within the European Economic Area (EEA) and European Free Trade Association (Efta).Such a move would be unacceptable to many Brexit supporters because it would leave the United Kingdom expected to accept free movement, although its advocates claim Ms May would have some ability to impose conditions.A Lords amendment that would require the Government to negotiate continued membership of the EEA could be put to a vote on Tuesday, but Labour peers have reportedly been told to abstain.Labour’s Lord Alli, one of the signatories to the amendment, accused the party leadership of being “paralysed by indecision”.He told the Observer: “This is complete cowardice. There is no point in being in politics to abstain, If you stand in the middle of the road someone is going to knock you over.”The Labour frontbencher set out his party’s plan on BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: “What we have said very clearly — and I think actually quite a lot of the Conservatives are going to follow us in this — we remain within the customs union during the transition period, we want to negotiate a customs union, that will solve the Northern Ireland border problem, which I think is intractable.”Mr McDonnell said there “will be movement from the EU” towards the Labour position.He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that as well as the customs union plan “we want to get as close to the single market as we possibly can”. – PANegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"prince louis pictured at three days old","story":"Pictures of Prince Louis’s first days at home — including a snap of the British baby royal being cuddled by his big sister — have been released by their parents.The newest member of the royal family, born on April 23rd, was photographed by the duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace when he was just three days old.Louis is pictured in a white outfit propped up on top of a white frilly cushion on a seat at the family residence in London.A second photograph shows Louis receiving a kiss from his sister Princess Charlotte, taken by their mother on May 2nd, Charlotte’s third birthday.Louis appears to be sleeping soundly, as Charlotte puts a protective arm around her baby sibling and plants a kiss on his forehead.The palace said the duke and duchess of Cambridge, William, and Kate, were “very pleased” to share the photographs, adding: “Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank members of the public for all of the kind messages they have received following the birth of Prince Louis, and for Princess Charlotte’s third birthday.”The duchess, a keen photographer, bucked tradition when she took the official photographs of her newborn daughter in 2015.A history of art graduate, she has released pictures to mark other milestones in her children’s lives. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/26/TELEMMGLPICT000158730485_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"facebook accused introducing extremists one another suggested","story":"Facebook has been accused of failing to tackle extremist material Facebook has helped introduce thousands of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) extremists to one another, via its \u0027suggested friends\u0027 feature, it can be revealed.The social media giant - which is already under fire for failing to remove terrorist material from its platform - is now accused of actively connecting jihadists around the world, allowing them to develop fresh terror networks and even recruit new members to their cause.Researchers, who analysed the Facebook activities of a thousand Isil supporters in 96 countries, discovered users with radical Islamist sympathies were routinely introduced to one another through the popular \u0027suggested friends\u0027 feature.Using sophisticated algorithms, Facebook is designed to connect people who share common interests.The site automatically collects a vast amount of personal information about its users, which is then used to target advertisements and also direct people towards others on the network they might wish to connect with.But without effective checks on what information is being shared, terrorists are able to exploit the site to contact and communicate with sympathisers and supporters.Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has used social media for propaganda purposesThe extent to which the ‘suggested friend’ feature is helping Isil members on Facebook is highlighted in a new study, the findings of which will be published later this month in an extensive report by the Counter Extremism Project a non profit that has called on tech companies to do more to remove known extremist and terrorist material online.Gregory Waters, one of the authors of the report, described how he was bombarded by suggestions for pro-Isil friends, after making contact with one active extremist on the site.Even more concerning was the response his fellow researcher, Robert Postings, got when he clicked on several non-extremist news pages about an Islamist uprising in the Philippines.Within hours he had been inundated with friend suggestions for dozens of extremists based in that region.Mr Postings said: Facebook, in their desire to connect as many people as possible have inadvertently created a system which helps connect extremists and terrorists.”Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to tackle terrorist material on the siteOnce initial introductions are made the failure of Facebook to tackle extremist content on the site means Jihadists can quickly radicalise susceptible targets.In one example uncovered by the researchers, an Indonesian Isil supporter sent a friend request to a non-Muslim user in New York in March 2017.During the initial exchange the American user explained that he was not religious , but had an interest in Islam.Over the following weeks and months the Indonesian user began sending increasingly radical messages and links including pro-Isil propaganda, all of which were liked by his target.The study also examined the extent to which Facebook was failing to tackle terrorist material on its site.Of the 1,000 Isil supporting profiles examined by researchers, less than half of the accounts had been suspended by Facebook six months later.Facebook has said there is no place for terrorists on its siteMr Posting said: Removing profiles that disseminate IS propaganda, calls for attacks and otherwise support the group is important...the fact that the majority of pro-IS profiles in this database have gone unremoved by Facebook is exceptionally concerning.Even when terrorist material was identified and the offending posts removed, the user was often allowed to remain on the site.There have also been numerous examples of pro-Isil accounts being reinstated after the user complained to moderators about their suspension.In one case a British terror suspect had his Facebook account reinstated nine times after complaining, despite being accused of having posted sick Isil propaganda videos.Mr Waters said: This project has laid bare Facebook\u0027s inability or unwillingness to efficiently address extremist content on their site.The failure to effectively police its platform has allowed Facebook to become a place where extensive IS supporting networks exist, propaganda is disseminated people are radicalised and new supporters are recruited.Islamic State supporters have been introduced to one another on FacebookMr Postings added: “Even when profiles or content is removed, it is not always done fast enough, allowing Isil content to be to be widely share and viewed before getting removed.”Mr Waters said: “The fact that Facebook\u0027s own recommended friends algorithm is directly facilitating the spread of this terrorist group on its site is beyond unacceptable.Simon Hart, a Conservative MP who sits on Culture Media and Sport Select Committee, said: The idea that Facebook is inadvertently providing an introduction service for terrorists is quite extraordinary. It is another terrifying example of the unintended consequences of this sort of technology.If you design a system for one thing and it becomes another it is hard to police.Nobody will have set out to provide a network for terrorists to connect, but the important thing is how Facebook responds now this matter has been raised with them.A spokesman for Facebook  said: There is no place for terrorists on Facebook. We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.Our approach is working – 99 per cent of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism.We have and will continue to invest millions of pounds in both people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content.Mother of teen shot dead in south London says he was \u0026#39trying to make a difference\u0026#39Comment: On this day in 1994: the Channel Tunnel opens, linking England to France UK weather: Monday set to be hottest early May Bank Holiday on record with highs of 28CNorth Korea says US ruining detente atmosphere ahead of Trump summit with \u0026#39misleading\u0026#39 claimsComment: Teachers fat-shaming our children is the natural result of a free NHSComment: Arlott and Swanton were the last of the gentleman broadcastersEnd of \u0026#39hell for leather training\u0026#39 as Army gets new fitness regime Liz Hurley \u0026#39left very upset by burglary at mansion after dinner party\u0026#39Boris Johnson travelling to Washington in bid to save Iran dealDrill attack on woman may have been homophobic attack, police sayPrince Louis photo: A kiss for Royal baby brother from sister CharlotteSocial media is fuelling a surge in rail graffitiUniversities struggle to recruit top students as schools \u0026#39mercilessly push\u0026#39 Russell Group to pupilsComment: The Iran nuclear deal was based on lies and is untenableBritain must wake up to \u0026#39folly\u0026#39 of trusting Iran over nuclear deal – Israeli ambassador Ministers urged to demand answers from Qatar over its alleged support for terrorismComment: Parliament should reject Brexit game-playing and accept the country’s decisionTory MPs threaten to \u0026#39throw the kitchen sink\u0026#39 at John Bercow Jeremy Corbyn warned he could keep Labour out of office for another decade if he fails on BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/05/TELEMMGLPICT000162388207_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7aytLzvMMfvyoYe1n9J4aPKnxiBOC-Ttvtxh1Wl2WOc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"passengers compare scene inside caribbean cruise ship titanic","story":"Deck 9 on the Carnival DreamThe scene on board a cruise ship in the Caribbean drew comparisons to the Titanic as 50 staterooms on Deck 9 were flooded.A breach in the Carnival Dream\u0027s fire extinguishing system led to water pouring into a corridor.One passenger said people had been relocated to the spa to sleep on yoga mats.Marla DeAnn Haase, a passenger, posted images of the flooding on Facebook .She wrote: Um....FB folks.....this is a rare moment of internet connection ....we are flooding on a cruise, we heard the violins and the silverware all came crashing down.

In the first quarter of 2018 there were 399 graffiti attacks on trains, the highest quarterly figure since the first quarter of 2010, according to figures obtained from the British Transport Police using Freedom of information laws.The surge in graffiti on the railway networks has forced the British Transport Police to reintroduce a dedicated CID team to specifically investigate graffiti crime.Trains operated by Southeastern Rail have been among those most frequently targeted by graffiti artists.Social media is allegedly fuelling the rise in graffitiWe’ve seen a more-than-doubling in the number of large mural-type graffiti attacks on our trains over the last three months, and that this is something that other train operators are experiencing too,” a spokesman for the company said in a statement.“We’re working closely with the British Transport Police to tackle the issues.“They’ve stepped up patrols and recently reintroduced a dedicated investigation team to identify the perpetrators and take appropriate criminal action.“Network Rail are also bringing in extra security to patrol and secure the network.”Experts say that the trend is being driven by new technology and the rise of social media, with artists using remote-controlled drones to avoid detection and attempting to outdo each other in daring videos that document their crimes and are posted online.“Instagram has completely changed the game,” says Darren Cullen, a former graffiti writer who is now owner and director of Graffiti Kings, a company that runs spray can art workshops for young people.“Now graffiti artists aren’t discouraged by the fact that their work might be painted over as soon as it is finished.“Even if no one ever sees it in real life - you can still take photos and reach a huge audience instantly through social media.”Graffiti cases are soaring across the UKSeveral UK graffiti Instagram accounts have thousands of followers and allow graffiti writers to compete for recognition by showing proof of the quality of their art as well as their increasing appetite for risk.The independent graffiti magazine UKFrontline has more than 16,800 followers on Instagram and the images it posts, which mainly document graffiti on trains around Britain, regularly get thousands of views from around the world.Some of the videos posted on Instagram and on YouTube show freshly painted artworks, while others show groups of graffiti writers, with their faces covered, in action as they paint on train carriages.Painting murals illegally on trains has been the goal since modern graffiti culture was forged in New York in the 1980s, but large multi-colour artworks have rarely been seen on UK trains following a crackdown on prolific graffiti artists in the 90s, according to Joe Epstein, an author and photographer who has documented graffiti and street art in London since 2006.“Over the last few years it has started to become a regular occurrence,” he said. “It’s quite extraordinary because five years ago people would always talk about what was done on trains in the 90s and say it is pretty much unachievable these days.”One factor that has tipped the balance in favour of graffiti writers are cuts to police budgets, something that has reduced resources available for investigating criminal damage incidents.Graffiti artists are using drones to chose targetsGraffiti writers have also embraced modern technology to avoid capture, including drones fitted with video cameras, which are used to monitor train yards before the vandals break in and paint a train.“Drones are being used a lot,” said one graffiti writer who spoke on condition of anonymity.“It’s not uncommon to visit spots regularly for months, watching the trains to see where they stop and for how long – timing them so you know how long you’ve got.”There were 800 graffiti crimes that targeted trains over the whole of 2017, an increase of 49 per cent compared to a low of 537 in 2013.If the trend continues British Transport Police will record more graffiti incidents on trains in the UK this year than any other year since 2008.Graffiti artists are posting their work onlineAnnual graffiti attacks on associated infrastructure, such as train lines and stations, has also steadily increased, nearly doubling since 2013.The biggest increases in graffiti on trains have been recorded in the regions patrolled by British Transport Police’s South East of England subision and its Transport for London subision.In 2017 the number of graffiti crimes on trains in the South East of England was 78 per cent higher than in 2013, while the number of crimes targeting Transport for London trains were up by 51 per cent.Efforts by Southeastern Rail to quickly clean graffiti off trains has been hampered by a £5 million improvement programme, which is taking place over the next 6-9 months.“In the short-term we’re taking the approach that passengers would prefer a train in service with graffiti on it, than one cancelled,” a spokesman said.A spokesperson for Transport for London said that its ability to combat graffiti had not been impacted by cuts and any increase in the visibility of graffiti on its trains is due to the rise in activity by graffiti writers that target its trains.No one from Instagram was available for comment.Mother of teen shot dead in south London says he was

That gets us absolutely nowhere\u0027Damian Hinds should “stop choking” schools and threatening them with Ofsted inspections, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has said.Speaking to headteachers in Liverpool, Ms Rayner called on the education secretary to stop “beating schools over the head” with the current inspection regime, and instead to take a collaborative approach. It comes after Mr Hinds announced plans to overhaul measures used to hold schools to account. But schools will still be forced to become academies if they are judged to be inadequate by Ofsted, he said. Cost pressures on schools have been ‘challenging’, minister admitsAt the annual conference of National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) in Liverpool, Ms Rayner said the current accountability system in schools was unfit for purpose. The Labour MP questioned the climate in which 10- and 11-year-olds are told they have failed Sats exams, which are supposed to only be used to hold schools to account rather than the children themselves. “At a time when they are supposed to be excited about going into secondary school they are being told they are not good enough. We are putting them on a constant cycle of testing,” she said. Her comments come after The Independent revealed that thousands of parents are expected to withdraw their children from the Sats exams as they say accountability data is being put before children’s wellbeing. Ms Rayner said: “I have got a message for Damian in government – you really do need to stop choking schools and threatening them with the inspection regime at the moment.”She added: “You need to be supporting and helping them... It is not just about beating schools over the head and threatening them. That gets us absolutely nowhere.”A motion calling on the NAHT to support school leaders in challenging Ofsted when they investigate complaints from parents against headteachers and senior staff was passed at the conference on Saturday. “School leaders are vulnerable and easy to attack. We are an easy target for an ever-increasing dissatisfaction in the public realm.”He added: “It is humbling and heartbreaking to watch professionals shake and cry. To go from being infectiously optimistic to a state of anxiety, paranoia, lack of self-esteem and suffer stress related illness. “A significant contributory factor that cannot be underestimated is the complaints culture that has been developed over the last three years.”The shadow education secretary, who received two standing ovations from headteachers for her speech, added: “I really am concerned about the testing regime in primary and in early years. Actually we know through international standards and through the evidence that that actually is not always the best way forward.“The current system isn’t fit for purpose, it isn’t delivering what we want for our young people. So we need to change that. I want a focus and an emphasis in the early years to make sure we look at child development and look at building children to be resilient.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAnti-independence supporters wave Union Jack flags as thousands of demonstrators march in support of Scottish independence through the streets of Glasgow.Prime Minister Theresa May with her supporters during a visit to Wandsworth Town Hall, where the Conservative Party retained control of Wandsworth Council in the local elections.Jeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in Islington after voting in the local elections.A memorial to George Michael outside his house in Highgate, north London.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration.

These trials have been shown up to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted.“These findings are exactly what many feared: that this draconian measure would result in blameless iniduals being disenfranchised. It is vital moving forward that these draconian trials are not a fait accompli for a national rollout.”The figures did not take into account whether voters came back with the correct ID having initially been turned away. It is also impossible to know how many people were put off from entering a polling station altogether because of the new ID requirements.Democracy Volunteers, the UK’s largest election observer group, collated the figures while carrying out extensive observations of the ID checks in 243 polling stations across the five areas the scheme was being piloted.John Ault, director of the organisation, told The Independent 10 voters had been turned away within a 45-minute period at one polling station in Swindon, and that the issue appeared to disproportionately affect ethnic minority voters.British voters furious at being denied right to cast ballot over ID“Obviously there were always going to be teething problems, but I also think quite clearly that if you – whether intentionally or otherwise – exclude 1.5 to 2 per cent of the population, that is a significant problem,” he said.“The process was quite well run. Staff were welcoming and generally helpful, they tried to assist people who didn’t realise they were required to bring ID.“But the problem is some people clearly weren’t able to produce it, and we don’t know how many people didn’t come because they didn’t have it in the first place.”Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, clamed it was “impossible” for the government to justify rolling out the scheme.“After completely ignoring a number of serious warning signs, the government decided to pilot discriminatory measures which denied people their right to vote,” she said.“We cannot allow the Conservative Party to undermine our democracy, which is why Labour is calling on the government to scrap its voter ID plans as a matter of urgency.”Campaigners had questioned the evidence on which the trials were based. Figures from the Electoral Commission show there were just 28 allegations of impersonation in 2017 out of nearly 45 million votes – or one case for every 1.6 million votes cast. Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.Senior officials in trial areas expressed their concerns about the trials, while the government was criticised by the UK Statistics Authority for pushing misleading figures to support the need for the pilots.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsA government spokesperson insisted the pilots had been a “success”.“Voter ID is an important step to ensuring the public can have greater confidence in our democratic system and the success of yesterday’s pilots proves that this is a reasonable and proportionate measure to take,” he said.“The overwhelming majority of people cast their vote without a problem. We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally. As well as this, the independent Electoral Commission will conduct a planned evaluation of the pilots.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist\u0027Katie Holley was jolted awake by a cold thing – what she had initially thought was a small piece of ice that somehow slid down her left ear. Still disoriented, she rushed to the bathroom, grabbed a cotton swab and slowly stuck it inside her ear. And then Ms Holley felt something move. It was like a “rhythmic” movement, she recalled, as whatever it was tried to burrow deeper into her ear canal.She pulled out the cotton swab and saw small, dark brown pieces that looked like legs.Cockroaches have been a nuisance in the Holley household since she and her husband, Jordan Holley, bought their first home last year, she wrote in Self magazine this week. They thrive in warm and damp places and that includes Florida, where the young couple live and where flying cockroaches called palmetto bugs are most common. Households in warm cities, such as New Orleans, Houston and Atlanta, report more problems with cockroaches than much of the country.Woman discovers cockroach in Air India loungeWhite House infested with cockroaches, mice and ants, documents revealDoctors find live cockroach in woman’s skullA few weeks earlier, an exterminator sprayed every room inside the couple’s house in Melbourne, Florida and Ms Holley felt what turned out to be a very temporary sense of relief.That morning, around 1.45am on 14 April, Mr Holley rushed to the bathroom to help his panicking wife, grabbed a flashlight and looked inside her ear. And there it was, a small part still visible from the outside as it stayed there, lodged in the middle of the ear canal. Mr Holley managed to pull out a couple of legs using a pair of tweezers, but the intrepid bug had crawled too deep.The young couple drove to the emergency room just a few miles away. A man sitting behind a desk near the hospital’s entrance saw the look of panic in Ms Holley’s face and asked whether she was in pain.“A roach crawled into my ear while I was sleeping and it was stuck,” Ms Holley said she told him.She was given a wristband and taken to a room, where she lay on her side on a gurney, whimpering. A nurse injected the bug with the anaesthetic lidocaine to try to kill it. Ms Holley said she felt the roach move, twitching and wriggling further into her ear as it tried to avoid death. Two minutes later, it stopped moving.It took the doctor about 20 seconds to pull out chunks of the dead roach and Ms Holley saw what she thought was the remains of a small insect. She left the hospital nearly two hours later with a prescription for antibiotics and ear drops, relieved that it was all over. She and her husband vowed to never let the experience happen again, stopping by a Walmart to buy earplugs.Nine days passed, but Ms Holley’s ear still did not feel normal. It was still numb, she said and she felt some discomfort every time she yawned. Her medicine drops also had stopped passing through her ear, leading her to think that perhaps earwax had built up inside.She went to her physician for her regularly scheduled appointment and asked the doctor whether she could check her ear. Her doctor and a physician assistant flushed her ear four times. Using an otoscope, they peeked inside and there it was – another leg.Lord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaLord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaMs Holley’s doctor pulled out six pieces of the roach’s remains – but feared there was still more left. Ms Holley said her physician arranged for her to see a doctor who specialises in treating the ears, nose and throat (ENT) later that day.As she went home and waited, Ms Holley tried to remember how much of the roach was taken out at the emergency room more than a week ago.“Did they find the head? Antennae?” she wrote. “I couldn’t recall. But I could only hope that the ENT would only need to remove another teensy leg or two.”The specialist placed what looked like a microscope next to Ms Holley’s face. A few minutes later, she felt something bigger was getting extracted out of her ear canal. And then she saw it. Not a “teensy leg or two”. Not the remains of a baby roach. But a head, a torso, limbs and long antennae of what looked like a fully grown palmetto bug.For nine days, much of the dead roach sat in Ms Holley’s ear.“I was furious. I was really disappointed with the ER for not having seen that, for letting me believe it was all out,” Ms Holley, a 29-year-old sales and marketing manager, said on Saturday. “They said this is something that happens often. I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist.”Scientists create robotic cockroach to search disaster areasHolley declined to name the hospital she first went to in April.Holley said she did not have any permanent damage or infection. Palmetto bugs generally do not bite and if they do, their bites are not harmful.Cockroaches have been known to burrow into people’s ears. A South African hospital, for example, pulled two dozen critters out of people’s ears over a period of two years, according to a National Geographic article published last year.“Roaches are searching for food everywhere,” entomologist Coby Schal of North Carolina State University told National Geographic. “And earwax might be appealing to them.”But, still, as Ms Holley said: “It was still a roach. In my ear.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account? Log inWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian police carrying struggling opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

Our order from online shopping giant Amazon was dispatched from Doncaster in South Yorkshire, therefore avoiding the minimum price of 50p per unit of alcohol.Even with shipping costs of almost \u0026pound5, we were able to save almost \u0026pound4 on a total order of just over \u0026pound45 - a saving of almost 10 per cent. Although the controversial policy is designed to crack down on drinks such as superstrength cider and lager, it also drives up the price of more mainstream choices.Our order included bestsellers Stella Artois lager, Strongbow cider and Bell\u0027s whisky, as well as some perfectly palatable red and white plonk.Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Annie Wells said: It\u0026rsquos right we give minimum pricing a try to tackle Scotland\u0026rsquos damaging and deep-rooted relationship with alcohol.

Adult victims of alcohol-fuelled violence in the home are more isolated and less able to seek help. And in 51 per cent of violent incidents between strangers, the offender was drunk. The new strategy will focus on how to protect vulnerable people from the impact of alcohol-related violence, how to help high-risk drinkers change their behaviour and how to better manage the licensing system. The strategy would look at ways to boost the Government\u0026rsquos Domestic Abuse Bill and its new helpline for children living with alcohol dependent parents.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Margaret Thatcher sent two aircraft carriers – HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible – to help take back the Falklands in 1982.They were accompanied by an array of British destroyers, frigates and subs. A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. We have 19.”He stormed: “There may well be an occasion where we have to do something on our own. We would cobble together whatever taskforce we could. But we haven’t spent enough on escorts.”Downing Street last night insisted that Britain’s Navy did have enough ships.A spokesman said: “We are clear that our aircraft carriers are a sovereign capability and that we have the ships to allow them to deploy independently.“What the National Security Adviser was saying was that we are a member of Nato and have close defence relationships with allies and so such a scenario is unlikely.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The defence budget is increasing to make sure we have the armed forces we need to defend the country”.More than 150 faced having to leave if they did not pay a £2,389 visas bill.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have osteoarthritis and cannot work. If I have to buy new school shoes, I decide what bills I can’t pay.I shared a bed with Emilia for more than two years and in that time I barely slept. Every time she moved, I’d wake up and it took me hours to get back to sleep. In November 2017, I was referred to the charity by my support worker.Within days, I received a message about a bed that was going to be delivered. The charity was a lifeline for me and Emilia.I know so many families in need – one friend puts her three children to sleep in a single bed each night. Children shouldn’t be living this way.Thankfully Emilia now has the space to dream. Without Buttle UK this wouldn’t have happened.FOR 18 months, Sylvia Johnson, 35, woke up in the morning to find her youngest son Daniel, 11, lying on the floor in a sleeping bag.His big brother, Quentin, 13, would be curled up on the sofa, groggy and irritable after a terrible night’s sleep.With no money to replace her two boys’ broken beds, Sylvia – who suffers from rheumatic pain and cannot work – felt like she was not doing her job properly as a mother.Sylvia, of St Austell, Cornwall, says:MY children had third-hand beds that became unbearable for them. So Quentin felt happier sleeping on the sofa, while Daniel chose to sleep on the floor.He’d pile cushions on top of one another to make it more comfortable and fell asleep in a sleeping bag. Quentin was angry and irritable and the two of them would argue all the time because they were so tired.Both are bright and their schoolwork suffered. They were constantly late for school and Quentin started to take time off because he was so exhausted. His mood suffered and he started to get depressed.Every night, I was so stressed. I didn’t know where Daniel was going to sleep – the chair or the floor? I knew I had to tell someone but I was scared and felt like I wasn’t doing my job. I worried people would judge me or take my kids away.But I was losing my mind so I told the school and was referred to the charity in June last year. I know people take having a bed for granted but sleep is so important to a child’s health and education.Now with their new beds, Quentin is in the top set for maths, science and English.My sons have their own space and don’t argue anywhere near as much.It’s not shameful to need help and to ask for it. Some people think there’s no such thing as poverty in this country but they have no idea.This gift has changed our lives. Because someone was willing to help me and not judge us, I’ve been able to ask for help in other areas of my life.SINGLE mum Emma Ross couldn’t afford to replace her sons’ bunk beds when they broke last year.Emma, 38, was forced to share a bed with her sons Daniel, 13, and Christopher, six, for four weeks, while daughter Emily, 11, slept in the room next door. The barber, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, says: WHEN we moved house last November, the boys’ bunk beds got damaged. When you’re a single parent who works part-time, you allow for day-to-day expenses but not that kind of money.The three of us slept in my bed for four weeks and it was a nightmare.Daniel was grumpy when he woke up and teachers started to notice how tired Christopher was at school. I couldn’t tell them the truth so I just said he was going to bed too late.Daniel moved in with my ­parents until I was able to sort out a new bed. I got in touch with Buttle UK and they delivered new bunk beds within four weeks.I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The kids were over the moon and now wake up fresh for school.MUM-of-one Siobhan Flynn, 32, shared a bed with her nine-year-old son Joseph for almost a year after she could not afford to replace his broken one.Siobhan, who lives near Rochester, Kent, says:JOSEPH has autism. Sometimes I don’t think he knows why he doesn’t want to do something and he finds it hard to verbalise his needs. He had barely slept in his own bed when it broke in August 2016. It was poorly made and uncomfortable, and Joseph refused to sleep in it.I’d ask him questions and jokingly say, “Even Superman sleeps in his own bed,” but he found it difficult to be there alone. The company refused to replace his bed and wanted to send an engineer to check if there was a fault. But I was worried they would tear it apart and leave it in a worse condition, so I refused.I didn’t have enough money to buy another so Joseph ended up in bed with me. It was hard. He’d hog the covers and I’d always end up with no space, with either an arm or leg thrown over me, and it affected our sleep.Joseph finds it difficult to go to sleep at a normal time and usually drifts off around midnight. It doesn’t matter if I read him a story, put him in his pyjamas or give him a nice bath, Joseph reminds me of a mobile phone battery. He’s not going to switch off at 25 per cent, he needs to wind down completely. He is often tired at school and has fallen asleep in class but I can’t force him to go to sleep.It was almost a year living like this before I applied for a new bed and mattress – and I don’t know what I would have done ­without the charity’s help. Perhaps I’d still be in the same position because £400 for a new bed and mattress is a huge amount of money to me.There were no other options. Nowadays, Joseph still doesn’t sleep in his own bed as much as I would like.He doesn’t like being alone and hates the dark but it’s important he feels ­independent. Knowing he has his own safe and secure bed to sleep in is a huge relief. Kids need breathing 7 space of their own.THERE are three ways to get involved with our Beds for Kids campaign – and YOUR support will make all the difference.FOR every bed or mattress bought from Dreams Beds stores across the country, one will be donated to Chances for Children.READERS can also donate directly to the charity through the Beds for Kids page at mydonate.bt/charities/bedsforkids or via your Sun Savers wallet.YOU can also buy a copy of the specially created book, That’s No Place To Sleep.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was so miserable I even contemplated ending it all.“I’ve given up on my dad and the pain that he causes and I’m starting to build a life for myself.”In a heartbreaking interview, Taylor-Ann, a delivery driver, reveals how “Rocket” Ronnie has seen her just ten times in 21 years, despite living just TEN miles from her in Essex.She also told how Ronnie, who is worth £8million, cut her £1,000-a-month maintenance payments after accusing her of treating him like a cash machine — and claimed he branded her a “cokehead”.He also offered ZERO help in her recovery, even though Ronnie checked himself into rehab in 2000 for drug and alcohol addiction.That lack of support left Taylor-Ann hurt and bewildered.She said: “I thought of all the people in the world he would understand better than most how I struggled with depression and how I’d turned to drink and drugs.People had helped him recover and forgiven him but he was clearly writing me off.”Growing up, Taylor-Ann saw very little of Ronnie, who last weekend crashed out of this year’s Snooker World Championships in the second round.Taylor-Ann’s mum, Sally Ann, discovered she was pregnant just weeks after an acrimonious split with Ronnie in 1996.Taylor-Ann says: “When I look back our relationship was tragic. I used to google my dad when I was little. I’d screen-shot pictures of him and compare them to ones of me to see if I resembled him. I was desperate for his attention.“I haven’t watched him play since I was four. He promised he’d wave to me from the telly and I watched a whole tournament just waiting for my special wave. It never came and I was heartbroken.”But with no real understanding of her dad’s true character, Taylor-Ann was not prepared for the blow that sent her life reeling in 2013, when she was just 17.She explained: “I’d got a place at college to do business studies. As it was too far to commute my mum helped me find a flat. I was thrilled. I loved the course and got distinctions in the first year. I was so excited about telling Dad so I met him in a cafe.“I told him Mum had transferred the £1,080 per month maintenance he paid to her into my bank to cover my rent, bills and college fees.“He seemed a bit surprised. He raised an eyebrow and said, ‘That’s what you use it for?’ I hit back, saying, ‘I just want my dad’.“He smiled and nodded. I asked him to stay in touch. I remember saying a phone call every couple of months would be plenty. It was pathetic, really, looking back. But then I had no idea what was about to happen.”She claims that after dropping her home, Ronnie severed all contact and immediately stopped the payments.She said: “He’d stopped paying the court-ordered amount. I couldn’t believe it, especially when he knew it was covering my rent and college fees.”Unable to pay her rent, Taylor-Ann lost her home and was forced to drop out of college — before the courts had time to order Ronnie to cough up the arrears. He later resumed the payments — but the damage had been done.Taylor-Ann said: “I became depressed by what had happened and started drinking heavily to forget how miserable I was. I lost my driving licence for speeding, my job, and doing cocaine became a regular thing.“To be honest I didn’t really care. I just wanted to blot out the pain my dad had caused. Several times I thought about just ending my life and the whole sorry mess.”Taylor-Ann, from Redbridge, Essex, claims she had no contact with dad-of-three Ronnie, who is now dating Holby City actress Laila Rouass, 46, for years before texting him in 2016.She said: “I hadn’t called him or spoken to him for three years. It felt like we were finally building bridges“I wasn’t even sure of his number but just sent a text saying, ‘Hi Dad’ and he replied, ‘All right mate’. Even that was difficult. I didn’t want to be his mate, I’m his daughter.“To be fair, we did have a long chat on the phone a few days later. We caught up on everything that had happened to both of us. He sounded like he cared then.“We talked a couple more times on the phone over the next few months. It felt we were finally building bridges.”They even went out for a Thai meal last March with his children from another relationship Lily, now 12, and little Ronnie, ten.She said: “It was lovely to see my brother and sister. I really love them and am happy and grateful that they have a better relationship with their dad than I do. I confided in Dad about my problems.“He offered to pay for me to re-take my driving test and get my licence back. He could see how touched I was by the offer and even said, ‘Look, it’s not just you I ignore when things get difficult — I do it to Lily when she gets demanding’.“I think he was trying to make me feel better — in a clumsy way. I was grateful and managed to ask why he’d stopped paying my maintenance the year before.“His reply stunned me. He said, ‘You know Taylor-Ann, I’ve gone through life with people treating me like an ATM machine. Why should I keep paying? What do I get out of it?’”She found Ronnie’s hard love a shock and was more confused when he sent her a text that night. She said: “He sent me a really lovely message. He said he was proud of me for recognising my problems and attempting to deal with them.“I immediately forgot his harsh words earlier and was so delighted that he’d said he was proud of me. It was one of the few times he’d paid me a compliment in my life.”But the relationship took a terrible turn when Taylor-Ann — who had still not kicked her drug issue — went on a night out with a mutual friend of Ronnie’s.During a cocaine binge, the friend told Taylor-Ann her dad had warned the rest of the family to sever all ties with her. She said: “I was so hurt, so upset. I had no idea whether it was true. At some point the person I was with rang my dad and started having a go at him.“She had the phone on speaker and I heard my dad say, ‘You pair of cokeheads need help’.“I just broke down and sobbed because he obviously wasn’t going to help me. I tried to contact him to explain but it seemed he no longer wanted to know.”A few days later — in March last year — a broken Taylor-Ann checked into a rehab centre for cocaine addiction. But she claims at no point did her dad visit, call or even message to ask how she was.Just days after coming out of rehab she landed a new job at a car parts firm, where she met her boyfriend — and father of her child — Naihan Chowdhury, 21. The pair are now sharing a one-bed flat in Romford, Essex.Taylor-Ann, whose baby is due in October, said: “We don’t have a lot but we have everything a baby needs — two parents that love it and want to cherish and care for it.“Naihan is the same age as my dad was when I was born, but I already know he’s going to be a better dad than Ronnie ever was because he’s here and helping. I wish Dad had been there for me but he wasn’t, all I ever wanted was his love. I’ll make sure we learn from all the mistakes he made with me.”Ronnie declined to comment on Taylor-Ann’s claims.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.Our approach is working – 99 per cent of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403689862.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow likened harvey weinstein black rod","story":"A former House of Commons official says the Speaker had “stepped over the line”.Mr Bercow is resisting calls to step down over bullying allegations which he denies.Former Black Rod David Leakey — who worked with him — said: “John Bercow is not an altogether bad Speaker.

Odette Kurland, who as the founder of Laughter Yoga Wellness London is one of the organisers of some of the day\u0027s events in the capital, is keen to extol what she believes it offers.She told Sky News World Laughter Day was founded on the idea that getting people to laugh together can help promote world peace.\"Dr Katari was a medical doctor who found evidence that the body cannot tell the difference between real and simulated laughter through yoga.\"He got together with a group of friends in Mumbai to get people to laugh because the benefits are fantastic.\"Laughter yoga involves using a combination of deep breathing exercises and voluntarily moving the diaphragm to force laughter when someone exhales.When within a group, it often causes involuntary laughter.Ms Kurland, who also practises under the nickname Lady Ha Ha, says that causes the brain to produce chemicals that have positive effects. She claims it can be used to treat bipolar disorder, depression and even chronic pain.\"When you laugh, the endorphins you release are stronger and more powerful that morphine.\"People with chronic pain who have done laughter yoga sessions have told me it has been the first time they have felt no pain for a long time.\"Dr Sophie Scott, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Speech Communication Lab, University College London, says: \"It\u0027s true that there are measurable benefits for pain, but that is entirely due to the exercise that you are doing.\"It would be the same if you were running on the spot. You do get a decrease in adrenaline and a decrease in cortisol, the stress hormone.\"You get an impact on brain chemistry, you feel better.\"But there is no evidence that there are health benefits beyond that.\"She says that she knew of people who could in fact experience the opposite effect, by being made to laugh when they don\u0027t want to.\"Many people won\u0027t laugh at any time. They feel awkward. I know people who hate laughter yoga for that reason. One friend, his cortisol actually rose. When I tried it, I got a migraine.\"The effects of involuntary laughter are wider, however.Dr Scott says: \"There is evidence that married couples, for example, who deal with stress with laughter, stay together longer. \"But it\u0027s not limited to those in romantic relationships. Its importance as a behaviour cannot be understated. It depends on the social context.\"I also know people who do not like to go to stand up comedy because they don\u0027t want to be forced to laugh.\"What\u0027s clear is that in order for people to laugh, they need to be with others and people they feel comfortable with - jokes are not enough.But, Dr Scott has no doubt about its benefits, whatever makes you titter, chuckle, snort or guffaw.\"We learn the importance of laughter very early. Babies have been found to pay attention to their parents\u0027 laughter to determine whether a situation is safe. They do that long before they have language.\"It\u0027s also been found, in research on psychopathy, that children who show the early traits do not join in (with laughter) when in groups.\"When you think about it, it only ever exists in social situations. You don\u0027t really laugh when you are on your own.\"We\u0027ve ignored it for too long but we are slowly learning about how important it is.\""}]
