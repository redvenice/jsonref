Its emergence on the national stage gives Spain five political parties, furthering political fragmentation in a country that was alternately ruled for decades by the Socialists and the Popular Party.       A ided Spain voted on Sunday in its third general election in four years. Pictured are supporters of far right party Vox cheer as party leader Santiago Abascal addresses them outside the party headquarters following the general election in Madrid       Santiago Abascal, leader of far-right party Vox, addresses supporters gathered outside the party headquarters following the general election in Madrid on SundayTo stay in office, the Socialists and Sánchez must form a governing alliance with smaller parties, including the far-left United We Can led by Pablo Iglesias.Iglesias said after the vote the he \u0027would have liked a better result, but it\u0027s been enough to stop the right-wing and build a left-wing coalition government,\u0027 adding that he\u0027s already offered support to Sanchez.But Sánchez will still need 11 more seats to get the 176-seat majority he needs in the lower house of parliament, meaning he may be forced to make pacts with Catalan and other separatist parties - moves that would anger many Spaniards on the left and the right.Pablo Casado, who had steered the Popular Party further to the right to try to stop it from losing votes to Vox, called the worst ballot result ever for his party \u0027very bad,\u0027 saying \u0027we\u0027ve been losing our electoral support for several elections.\u0027Turnout was nearly 76 per cent, up more than 8 points since the previous election in 2016. The vote surge included a huge boost in the northeastern Catalonia region, which has been embroiled in a political quagmire since its failed secession bid in 2017 put separatist leaders in jail while they are tried.       Supporters of Spanish Prime Minister and Socialist Party candidate Pedro Sanchez gather at the party headquarters waiting for the results The arrival of Vox in Madrid\u0027s national parliament marks a big shift for Spain, where the far right has not played a significant role since the country\u0027s transition to democracy following the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975.The Popular Party and the Citizens party had focused their campaigns on unseating Sánchez, hinting they could create a conservative coalition government - with the backing of Vox - like a regional one that recently ousted the Socialists from southern Andalusia.Speaking Sunday after voting, Sánchez said he wanted a mandate to undertake key social and political reforms.The prime minister said he wanted \u0027a stable government that with calmness, serenity and resolution looks to the future and achieves the progress that our country needs in social justice, national harmony\u0027 and in fighting corruption.At the Palacio Valdes school in Madrid, voter Alicia Sánchez, a 38-year-old administrator, worried about the influence of Vox.\u0027I\u0027ve always come to vote, but this time it feels special. I\u0027m worried about how Vox can influence policies on women and other issues. They are clearly homophobic. Reading their program is like something from 50 years ago,\u0027 she said.Having voted in all elections since Spain returned to democratic rule four decades ago, Amelia Gómez, 86, and Antonio Román, 90, said they had little faith in any of the candidates.\u0027All I want is for whoever wins to take care of the old people,\u0027 Gómez said, complaining that together the two of them receive less than 1,000 euros ($1,100) a month in state pensions."},{"url":null,"title":"MPs meet pile pressure Corbyn second referendum","story":"Share this article Chancellor Philip Hammond will be at the Whitehall Brexit talks with his counterpart John McDonnell today but so far there has been no breakthrough that would take Britain out of the EU.          Labour\u0027s business spokesman, Rebecca Long-Bailey, yesterday suggested the party\u0027s call for a second referendum would not apply if it did a deal with Theresa MayBoth their parties facing internal pressures ahead of European elections with the Tories fearing the May 23 poll could result in an electoral mauling for Theresa May if she has not been able to deliver the Brexit that Britons voted for almost three years ago.The contest is also forcing Labour to clarify its position on a second referendum, with Jeremy Corbyn and the party\u0027s National Executive Committee under pressure from MPs and MEPs to back a vote on any Brexit deal.Senior Tories have said they still hope the elections - and the threat posed by Nigel Farage\u0027s Brexit Party - can be avoided if a compromise deal can get through Parliament before polling day, allowing the contest to be cancelled.But Labour has played down the prospects of a breakthrough in the cross-party talks, accusing Mrs May of refusing to change her Brexit red lines.Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey hit back at claims from the Conservatives that her side has been stalling, saying: \u0027We\u0027re certainly not dragging our heels.\u0027Further talks are expected between the two sides on Monday afternoon and the Labour frontbencher said: \u0027I think the discussions so far have been productive, they\u0027ve gone into a lot of detail, there seems to be a willingness on both sides to move towards some form of consensus.\u0027But she told Sky News: \u0027As yet we haven\u0027t seen the Government move on any of their red lines, we\u0027re having further discussions this week and hopefully we\u0027ll see some movement.\u0027Ms Long-Bailey will join shadow chancellor John McDonnell, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman and senior aides in talks with Government counterparts on Monday. The party\u0027s deputy leader Tom Watson went over Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s head to urge activists to lobby for a second poll.       He appealed to campaigners to lobby members of the party\u0027s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) ahead of a meeting which will decide whether to make a manifesto commitment to a \u0027confirmatory\u0027 referendum in next month\u0027s European Parliament elections. Mr Watson published details of NEC members and told his 300,000 Twitter followers: \u0027Please let your reps on the NEC know if you want them to support a confirmatory ballot on a Brexit deal.\u0027He was backed by Momentum chief Jon Lansman, who said: \u0027Surely we can all agree a confirmatory vote.\u0027The idea of a second referendum is opposed by senior members of Mr Corbyn\u0027s inner circle, who fear it would enrage party supporters who backed Brexit. Labour\u0027s communities spokesman Andrew Gwynne also played down the need for a second poll, telling the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show: \u0027I want to ensure that we avoid a bad Tory Brexit or a No Deal scenario.\u0027The shadow cabinet will meet tomorrow to agree a position ahead of the publication of the party\u0027s manifesto next week. "},{"url":null,"title":"Ryanair tried charge autistic boy 25 fee comfort doll","story":"Share this article Writing on Facebook, Ms Estella said: \u0027My poor Leo is at Alicante airport and they wanted to charge to take his doll on board.. he has had a huge autistic meltdown and they have brought 5 police to him and refused to let him on the flight!\u0027He is now petrified and stuck in Alicante..

Photograph: Regis DuvignauTen staff nurses in the Health Service Executive earned more than €130,000 in 2018, with three of those earning more than €140,000.The figures, released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act, show a total of 87 HSE nursing staff were paid more than €100,000 in salary payments last year. This is an increase of nine on the 78 who earned in excess of €100,000 in 2017.Those earning six-figure sums were mainly psychiatric nurses who earn large portions of their total pay in overtime, sometimes more than half their salary.The figures disclosed by the HSE show the median salary, including overtime, for the 31,415 nursing staff employed during the year was close to €50,000.A spokesman for the HSE ascribed the high overtime pay for psychiatric nurses to staff shortages in particular regions or in particular specialities.He said overtime was used in psychiatric care at times when there were staff vacancies to ensure continuity of service, particularly in frontline services to patients.“Every effort is made to minimise the use of overtime as we are very aware of the need for both staff and patient care, but there are occasions when there is no alternative.Mental health“Overtime figures should be considered in the overall context of delivering mental health services, including increasing demand for services and the ongoing challenges in relation to the recruitment and retention of nurses within mental health.”The spokesman said there were “particular challenges” in recruitment in some geographic areas and in some specialities. He said that additional funding for nursing courses would see extra recruits coming into the service in 2019.High overtime earnings by psychiatric nurses is not a new phenomenon – for example, four earned more than €140,000 in 2012.Peter Hughes, general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, said the figures reflected the overreliance within the HSE on overtime to maintain services.Part-timersThe data released covers every nurse who was paid by the HSE during the year, including those who worked part-time, or who only worked for a portion of the year, including those who left its employment, or who started work. Those cohorts would have been included in the 3,754 nurses who were paid €20,000 or less in 2018.A total of 3,420 nurses were paid between €20,000 and €29,999 4,818 were paid between €30,000 and €39,999 and 6,573 were paid between €40,000 and €49,999.A similar number (6,653) was paid between €50,000-€59,999 while 4,374 received salary payments of between €60,000 and €69,999.When it came to higher salaries, 443 were paid between €80,000 and €89,999 and 172 were paid between €90,000 and €99,999.Some 53 nurses were paid between €100,000 and 109,999 while 21 were paid between €110,000 and €119,999.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established North-South rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect North-South co-operation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which keeps May’s minority Conservative government in power,\u0026nbspalso objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union after the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The transition is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons and the backstop was one of the reasons why the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by 230 votes on January 15th, inflicting the heaviest parliamentary defeat ever on a British government. It was defeated a further two times after that,\u0026nbspprompting a postponement of Brexit until October 31st, 2019 (or before that if the withdrawal agreement is approved). Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK.\u0026nbspThe DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbspMany Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in October 31st, 2019 unless an extension of that date is agreed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Andrew MilliganPABritain’s Conservative government and Labour have discussed the prospect of a second referendum in talks aimed at finding a common approach to Brexit, Theresa May’s de facto deputy said on Monday. Cabinet office minister David Lidington was speaking after the latest negotiating session, which he described as positive and productive.Labour’s official policy allows for the possibility of a second referendum to prevent a no-deal Brexit or a form of Brexit the party views as damaging to the economy. “We’ve always known this is part of Labour’s policy platform, so it’s something I would have expected them to raise at these meetings and they have,” Mr Lidington said. “Equally, they know this is not something that is government policy and the last couple of times it has come before the House of Commons, it has been defeated.” Downing Street suggested on Monday that the current parliamentary session could be extended beyond the summer if MPs fail to approve a Brexit deal before then. The government was expected to start a new parliamentary session in June with a queen’s speech setting out a fresh legislative programme.Withdrawal agreementBut prime minister Theresa May’s spokesman said the two-year session that began in June 2017 was twice as long as usual in order to deliver Brexit.“What we are focused on is the withdrawal agreement Bill, because that is the legislation which is necessary in order to ratify our withdrawal from the EU. That is part of the current queen’s speech cycle and we need to finish that work. The government is always bringing forward legislation in order to allow it to deliver on its agenda,” he said.Whitehall sources acknowledge that the government cannot win a majority for the withdrawal agreement Bill without Labour’s “acquiescence” and that it is unlikely to pass before the European Parliament elections on May 23rd. If the Bill is rejected, the government cannot reintroduce it without proroguing parliament and starting a new session with a queen’s speech that also risks being rejected by MPs.Confidence-and-supplyThe end of the current parliamentary session will also mean the end of the Conservatives’ confidence-and-supply arrangement with the DUP. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds warned earlier this month that his party would consider any extension of the current session beyond June to be unacceptable.Former prime minister Tony Blair said on Monday that Brexit was likely to increase pressure in Northern Ireland for a Border poll and for a united Ireland.“The nationalist community is in favour at a theoretical level, at a conceptual level, but the degree of their agitation for it is intimately connected with their perception as to whether they can achieve nationalist aspirations and the legitimatisation of nationalist feelings within the United Kingdom, ” he told the Institute for Government think tank.“If Brexit acts as a destructive force on that, then it will encourage within the nationalist community, and even within parts of the more liberal unionist community, a feeling towards a Border poll that just wasn’t present during the years that I was in office.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignTheresa May announces extra £29 million to support victims of infected blood scandal, ahead of public hearingDrivers could get penalty points for not wearing seat belts as Government reviews rulesThree siblings win record £1 million damages from the Church of Scotland over abuse in a care home\u0026#39Why must we pay to report crime?\u0026#39 –  Baroness Newlove queries 101 service and says anti-social behaviour out of control Cambridge University launches inquiry into slave trade links and historic racismWhy Arya Stark was always destined to stab the Night King in the gutJeremy Hunt warns Theresa May Brexit deal with Labour could alienate more Tory MPs More than 2,500 prison staff disciplined in five years with majority for sex and drugs, MoJ figures showGP surgery prescribes £3.6m National Gallery treasure with every appointmentComment: Remainers have blown the EU elections, and increased the chance of a no-deal BrexitRuth Davidson calls on next prime minister to reject indyref2Instagram vows to remove content that encourages eating disorders such as anorexia after being challenged by health secretary A council uses drones to spy on planning disputes to \u0026#39stop staff being attacked by angry homeowners\u0026#39Arya\u0026#39s dagger: the secret history of that Valyrian steel knife in Game of ThronesTrans lawyer tries to stop catholic journalist tweeting her as she seeks high court injunctionBodies of two women found \u0026#39in a freezer\u0026#39 at home in east LondonCaledonian Sleeper beset with problems as it makes inaugural London-Scotland journeyHedge fund agrees record UK rent for office space MayfairMariam Moustafa death: Six teenagers admit affray as father describes sentence as \u0026#39very weak\u0026#39Comment: Wave a flag for the nation state – it\u0026#39s a force for moral good We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/29/TELEMMGLPICT000195548743_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4ClFGGjcI28awSNtOPAVs6pc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"gp surgery prescribes 36m national gallery treasure every appointment","story":"The portrait in situ at Pocklington Group PracticeArts and Entertainment EditorGaze at the walls of most GP surgeries and you will find leaflets about the ‘flu vaccine or posters encouraging you to eat your five a day.At Pocklington Group Practice in East Yorkshire, you will see a £3.6 million treasure from the National Gallery. It is a self-portrait by Artemisia Gentileschi, the most famous female painter of the 17th century, and one of the gallery’s most recent acquisitions.The surgery is one of several “unusual and unexpected venues” that will host the painting over the next few months, as part of a scheme reminding people that the National Gallery’s collection belongs to the nation.The gallery worked with the charity Paintings in Hospitals to select the surgery, where patients will be able to see the world famous work while waiting for their appointments. Amisha Karia, the charity’s head of loans, said: “Giving everyone access to art is something we believe in.“Studies have shown that seeing an artwork in a care environment can reduce anxiety and aid recovery. In some settings it provides distraction and calms you by giving you something to focus on.“In this case, Artemisia dealt with challenges in her life, painting at a time when that wasn’t accepted for women. I hope that the painting provides inspiration by showing that people can face challenges and come out the other side.”Berni Judge, managing partner of the practice, said the response from patients had been positive. People are just really amazed to see such a painting in a setting like this and have asked why it\u0027s here. There is lots and lots of excitement. Everyone has taken time to go and have a look at her.Non-patients will be able to view the painting at set “visiting times”. Judge said: We are still a working GP surgery and therefore we need to be able to continue our day-to-day operations as smoothly as possible, so we ask people to please remember and respect that if they are planning to come and visit Artemisia.”Dr Mari Austin takes a selfie with the Gentileschi portraitIt will be in situ until May 11, when it will move to a girls’ school. It was previously on temporary display in Glasgow Women’s Library. Dr Gabriele Finaldi, gallery director, said: “The National Gallery has never done a tour like this, taking a masterpiece to unexpected venues where it can be enjoyed by people who may not be able to see it in Trafalgar Square.“The response in Glasgow was superb and we are looking forward to engaging with local communities in the next surprising venues, a GP surgery and a school.”The National Gallery paid £3.6 million for the painting last year to fulfil a “long-held dream” of showing more female artists. It is only the 21st painting by women out of a total of 2,300.However, the organisation faced accusations of overspending after it emerged that the work had sold or just over £2 million a few months earlier.The oil painting dates from 1615-17 and depicts the artist as Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Gentileschi was a follower of Caravaggio and the first female member of the Accademia del Disegno in Florence.She trained under her father, the painter Orazio Gentileschi, who preceded her into the National Gallery collection. As a teenager, she was raped by Agostino Tassi, a painter who worked with her father, and endured a trial in which she was humiliated and tortured with thumbscrews to verify her testimony.The National Gallery said that “her biography has long overshadowed her artistic achievements, but she is now recognised as one of the most talented painters of her generation.”Theresa May announces extra £29 million to support victims of infected blood scandal, ahead of public hearingDrivers could get penalty points for not wearing seat belts as Government reviews rulesThree siblings win record £1 million damages from the Church of Scotland over abuse in a care home\u0026#39Why must we pay to report crime?\u0026#39 –  Baroness Newlove queries 101 service and says anti-social behaviour out of control Cambridge University launches inquiry into slave trade links and historic racismWhy Arya Stark was always destined to stab the Night King in the gutJeremy Hunt warns Theresa May Brexit deal with Labour could alienate more Tory MPs More than 2,500 prison staff disciplined in five years with majority for sex and drugs, MoJ figures showComment: Remainers have blown the EU elections, and increased the chance of a no-deal BrexitRuth Davidson calls on next prime minister to reject indyref2Instagram vows to remove content that encourages eating disorders such as anorexia after being challenged by health secretary A council uses drones to spy on planning disputes to \u0026#39stop staff being attacked by angry homeowners\u0026#39Arya\u0026#39s dagger: the secret history of that Valyrian steel knife in Game of ThronesTrans lawyer tries to stop catholic journalist tweeting her as she seeks high court injunctionBodies of two women found \u0026#39in a freezer\u0026#39 at home in east LondonCaledonian Sleeper beset with problems as it makes inaugural London-Scotland journeyHedge fund agrees record UK rent for office space MayfairMariam Moustafa death: Six teenagers admit affray as father describes sentence as \u0026#39very weak\u0026#39Comment: Wave a flag for the nation state – it\u0026#39s a force for moral good New rules on investigating rape could make police\u0026#39s job even harder, officers warnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/29/TELEMMGLPICT000195556318_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"isil leader abu bakr al baghdadi seen first time five years","story":"The Isil leader was last seen speaking from the pulpit of the Great Mosque al-Nuri in Mosul, Iraq. Many speculated he had been severely injuredAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the fugitive leader of the Islamic State (Isil) has appeared in a video for the first time in five years and claimed that the Sri Lanka terror attacks were revenge for the fall of the so-called caliphate. The jihadist leader has not been seen since he proclaimed the creation of the caliphate in a Mosul mosque in 2014 and there have been persistent rumours that he was badly injured and in failing health. But in a video released on Monday, Baghdadi appeared healthy. He sat cross-legged with an assault rifle at his side and the tips of his grey beard dyed orange as he spoke to several masked Isil fighters.  He vowed to carry out revenge attacks against the West in retaliation for the fall of Baghuz, the town in eastern Syria where his fighters made a last stand to defend Isil-held territory against advancing Kurdish forces.    Priests are seen in the background as a security personnel stands guard in front of St Anthony\u0026#39s Shrine, struck by IS-linked terrorists on Easter SundayHe said Isil supporters had carried out 92 attacks in eight countries in response to the defeat in Baghuz. He stressed that the jihadists had not retreated in the face of overwhelming odds and instead fought to the end. Your brothers will never forget you and they will avenge you, he said.In reality, hundreds of suspected Isil fighters surrendered to Kurdish forces before Baghuz was captured in late March. Baghdadi acknowledged Isil’s defeat there but said the jihadist would continue “a war of attrition” against its enemies.  Baghdadi, who is in his late forties, is among the world’s most-wanted men and Western intelligence agencies will be scouring the video for any scraps of information which could reveal his location. Analysts believe it is most likely he is hiding in the sparsely-populated desert in the west of Iraq, near the Syrian border. The US has offered a $25 million (£19 million) reward for information leading to his death or capture. The was released by al-Furqan, Isil’s official media unit. Baghdadi has released several audio recordings through al-Furqan in recent years but Monday’s video was the first time he since 2014 he has appeared on video.He made reference to recent events including the overthrow of the presidents of Algeria and Sudan and the re-election of Benjamin Netanyahu as the prime minister of Israel.   The video is set a room whose walls are covered in white cloth. As with many Isil propaganda videos, its appears to be a sophisticated production, with high-quality sound and lighting as well as graphics. Meanwhile, a ban on women wearing burqas came into force in Sri Lanka on Monday. Maithripala Sirisena, the country’s president, said the ban was a necessary security measure in the wake of the Easter Sunday bombing. Although the face veil ban will be automatically lifted with the emergency law, a presidential spokesman told The Daily  that the government is looking at imposing a more permanent ban on the Muslim face veil. Gunmen also killed at least six worshippers at a church in the west African state of Burkina Faso on Monday. The attackers arrived on motorcycles and reportedly shot dead the church’s pastor along with five other people. Jihadist groups linked to both Isil and al-Qaeda have been active in the area since 2016.Drivers could get penalty points for not wearing seat belts as Government reviews rulesThree siblings win record £1 million damages from the Church of Scotland over abuse in a care home\u0026#39Why must we pay to report crime?\u0026#39 –  Baroness Newlove queries 101 service and says anti-social behaviour out of control Cambridge University launches inquiry into slave trade links and historic racismWhy Arya Stark was always destined to stab the Night King in the gutJeremy Hunt warns Theresa May Brexit deal with Labour could alienate more Tory MPs More than 2,500 prison staff disciplined in five years with majority for sex and drugs, MoJ figures showGP surgery prescribes £3.6m National Gallery treasure with every appointmentComment: Remainers have blown the EU elections, and increased the chance of a no-deal BrexitRuth Davidson calls on next prime minister to reject indyref2Instagram vows to remove content that encourages eating disorders such as anorexia after being challenged by health secretary A council uses drones to spy on planning disputes to \u0026#39stop staff being attacked by angry homeowners\u0026#39Arya\u0026#39s dagger: the secret history of that Valyrian steel knife in Game of ThronesTrans lawyer tries to stop catholic journalist tweeting her as she seeks high court injunctionBodies of two women found \u0026#39in a freezer\u0026#39 at home in east LondonCaledonian Sleeper beset with problems as it makes inaugural London-Scotland journeyHedge fund agrees record UK rent for office space MayfairMariam Moustafa death: Six teenagers admit affray as father describes sentence as \u0026#39very weak\u0026#39Comment: Wave a flag for the nation state – it\u0026#39s a force for moral good New rules on investigating rape could make police\u0026#39s job even harder, officers warnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/29/TELEMMGLPICT000194559653_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEFm7itiPbYKoaoT-5_TwHBW1FMbCKSVYIAFzL2tVh-M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mirror sword gem inside mystery laden coronation new japanese","story":"Three Sacred Treasures of Japan are so rarely sighted that some experts have raised questions over whether they even existPerhaps unsurprisingly for the world’s oldest hereditary monarchy, the abdication of Emperor Akihito and the ascension of his son Crown Prince Naruhito will be shrouded in a series of ancient rituals and ceremonies as complex as they are mysterious.Forget fairytale crowns.

item.Analysis of Wrap data found aluminium foil and foil trays are the most frequently thrown away item that can be recycled, with a quarter (25 per cent) of households admitting to chucking them in the bin.This is despite the majority of councils now accepting foil as recycling, meaning they are contributing to unnecessary landfill. However many recycling plants will not accept foil if it is coated in food or grease, prompting councils to ask residents to wash their tin foil before separating it from general waste. Due to tin foil\u0027s thin and flimsy nature this may not always be the easiest of tasks, so councils are teaming up with the Aluminium Recycling Packaging Organisation to provide some guidance.In a bid to cut landfill waste, councils including Wealseden, Renfrewshire and Bracknell Forest are encouraging residents to always wash their kitchen foil thoroughly before recycling.Homeowners risk \u0026#039wasting their time\u0026#039 recycling because of confusion over what can be recycledRick Hindley, executive director at the Aluminium Recycling Packaging Organisation, said: What we say is give it a quick rinse. Contrary to popular myth it doesn\u0027t have to be squeaky clean.If there\u0027s a little bit of food left on it, such a a bit of pastry, its not necessarily a problem. If its really greasy, just wash it with soap. With foil containers you could stick them in the dishwasher with other items and you could reuse or recycle them without using any additional water.It comes after plans for every household in England to collect food waste in a separate caddy were announced. At present only about 35 per cent of households in England have to put food waste in its own caddy, with most councils instructing people to put it in their main bin.The UK\u0026#039s recycling rate has changed little over the yearsCouncils that insist households collect food in separate caddies may impose written warnings and, eventually, fines of up to £100, upon those which refuse to comply. It is thought that the scheme could pave the way for less frequent collections of general household waste.Unwanted food that goes into a general bin rots in landfill and creates methane, a greenhouse gas, which contributes to global warming.However, when food is collected separately, it can be put into an anaerobic digester and broken down into sludge, carbon dioxide and methane, which can be used for generating energy or running a vehicle.The sludge can be used as a soil fertiliser to help farmers grow crops. It is anticipated that the change will help the Government reach its targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Retail and Consumer industryTheresa May announces extra £29 million to support victims of infected blood scandal, ahead of public hearingDrivers could get penalty points for not wearing seat belts as Government reviews rulesThree siblings win record £1 million damages from the Church of Scotland over abuse in a care home\u0026#39Why must we pay to report crime?\u0026#39 –  Baroness Newlove queries 101 service and says anti-social behaviour out of control Cambridge University launches inquiry into slave trade links and historic racismWhy Arya Stark was always destined to stab the Night King in the gutJeremy Hunt warns Theresa May Brexit deal with Labour could alienate more Tory MPs More than 2,500 prison staff disciplined in five years with majority for sex and drugs, MoJ figures showGP surgery prescribes £3.6m National Gallery treasure with every appointmentComment: Remainers have blown the EU elections, and increased the chance of a no-deal BrexitRuth Davidson calls on next prime minister to reject indyref2Instagram vows to remove content that encourages eating disorders such as anorexia after being challenged by health secretary A council uses drones to spy on planning disputes to \u0026#39stop staff being attacked by angry homeowners\u0026#39Arya\u0026#39s dagger: the secret history of that Valyrian steel knife in Game of ThronesTrans lawyer tries to stop catholic journalist tweeting her as she seeks high court injunctionBodies of two women found \u0026#39in a freezer\u0026#39 at home in east LondonCaledonian Sleeper beset with problems as it makes inaugural London-Scotland journeyHedge fund agrees record UK rent for office space MayfairMariam Moustafa death: Six teenagers admit affray as father describes sentence as \u0026#39very weak\u0026#39Comment: Wave a flag for the nation state – it\u0026#39s a force for moral good We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/26/TELEMMGLPICT000096157228_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"wave flag nation state force moral good","story":"It is within the nation state that we learn to develop into morally mature adultsOn Sunday morning, the Church of St George, Hanworth celebrated its patronal festival with a special service, the congregation waving little flags of St George and singing Land of Hope and Glory.

Which has not stopped him founding Gospel Technology, mastering the mysteries of blockchain, and wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word “DEUS”. Now 40, the tech CEO was born in Cumbria, and retains the accent of the northwest, redolent of hills and dales. \u0026nbsp“All of my bloodline have been craftsmen,” he says – carpenters, metal workers, shaping “tangible” things. His father worked on oilrigs and at Sellafield. “I’m an engineer too,” he adds.\u0026nbsp“But I’ve gone more intangible. The trick is finding the tangibility in software.”After studying geology at Sheffield University, Smith got a job working for the British Antarctic Survey on the Y2K issue. It was 1999 and everyone was panicking about a potential technology meltdown. “I found I quite liked tech,” he says. From there he went to HSBC to set up their internet banking platform. “No one had a mobile phone back then – we actually had to make physical connections.” He shakes his head with a kind of amazement.A View from the Top with Mumsnet founder Justine RobertsBy 2010, the free flow of data was becoming more important than the infrastructure. It didn’t matter so much what the machine was any more. This was the thinking behind Smith’s first company, Butterfly, which provided “middle-ware” to enable businesses to adapt their hardware to accommodate and exploit data.It was a success, but Smith was fundamentally frustrated. It wasn’t “tangible” enough for him, it lacked something his forebears took for granted: the feeling of truth, of tangibility, the smack of the empirical. So after selling Butterfly to IBM in 2012, he “retired” and found greater “day-to-day fulfilment” buying and fixing up old Massey Ferguson tractors and planting a vineyard outside Henley. Ever the troubleshooter, Smith even came up with a fix for getting the grapes to ripen faster on the vine: “We’ve exposed the ground so it radiates the heat back at the vine – it gives you an extra 15 minutes of warmth at the end of the day.” \u0026nbspIt’s all very tangible, and even drinkable (the 2018 vintage looks set to be “some of the best”), but, as Smith discovered, “sometimes not working is more work than working”. His epiphany occurred when he read a paper by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is very likely that Satoshi Nakamoto does not exist and is the spurious cover for an inidual or iniduals unknown. But, even so, Nakamoto is credited with the invention of bitcoin. Smith was not particularly inspired by crypto-currency, but rather by “a beautifully elegant architecture”. He realised that at the core of the new concept of blockchain was the possibility of “trusted transactions”. In other words, of truth, even on the internet, which is fast becoming a byword for fraud and deception. He reckons a lot of social media is crippled by the same problem: “Consumption has moved ahead of governance.” A lot of users, but operating in a lawless, post-truth environment of information anarchy. He cites Facebook as a classic case study. “They recklessly moved forward without trust. I believe\u0026nbspin collaboration, but what if your collaborators turn out to be ill-intentioned Russians?”Created with Sketch.Technology comes to Bhutan Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A youth drinks whiskey at a bar in the capital city of Thimphu, BhutanDrayang dancer Lhaden, 38, performs in a bar in the capital city of Thimphu, Bhutan, December 16, 2017.

And truth and trust are interdependent. Truth generates trust without trust there is no truth. The question, as Smith saw it, while toiling honestly over his tractors and grapes, was how to achieve “trusted collaboration”. You can build a fortress, but then how do you move data out of the fortress and make it accessible to others, without also opening the door to thieves and bad guys? Smith says that trust can only be “data-driven” not “intuition-driven”. In other words, it’s hard to trust your fellow man or woman. “Problems arise where humans are interacting. If you’re involved in a digital process, then the human is usually a liability.”He laughs at the idea that this sounds rather like Skynet (of Terminator fame) i.e. all we need to do is completely eliminate humanity and all will be well. “What we’re doing is ensuring a trusted foundation to data, across businesses, governments and countries.” This is where blockchain comes in. It makes data accessible to a variety of users but protects against cyber attack. What everybody now fears, when you watch those pixels dance across your screen, is that you might be looking at “data” (so-called) that’s been hacked or corrupted. A form of “fake news”. Gospel is there to ensure the purity of your data. Smith makes a strong claim: “We have eliminated lying. It’s impossible to lie any more.”So does that mean novelists and Hollywood screenwriters are out of a job then? Smith allows that there is still scope for fiction in the world at large, but not in the realm of Gospel. “We’re talking about decentralised, distributed truth. But it’s a tighter network of participants.”Nadhim Zahawi: the CEO turned children\u0027s minister A View from the Top with Dragons\u0027 Den star Tej LalvaniA View from the Top: David Frank, the TV exec who upset the QueenA View From the Top: Peter Simpson of Anglian WaterThere is a philosophical air to Smith, as if he is seeing everything from a great height. He argues that what he calls “the old hub-and-spoke model” or “legacy architecture” doesn’t work any more. We used to have faith in a central core with players on the periphery. But Smith reckons we are all now sceptical about the centralisation of data. The failed efforts of the NHS to digitise provide a cautionary example. “Most of those projects are obsolete by the time they get to market. Machines used to have a five-year life. Now it’s more like six\u0026nbspmonths. Data has to be fluid.”The blockchain approach taken by Gospel has produced “a system in which multiple parties agrees that this is the truth”. The chain is a form of “distributed trust”. You need trust. But how do you trust? The answer is, every time you write to the chain, you create a signature\u0026nbspand you write that into the next block, creating “aggregated signatures”. This builds\u0026nbspwhat Smith calls “immutability”, making the exchange of data invulnerable to modification – and hacking.Since it was founded at the beginning of 2017, Gospel has specialised in working with the aerospace industry and pharmaceutical companies. But “removing risk and reducing cost” could be applied to just about any\u0026nbspbusiness\u0026nbsp– so everyone could do with a bit of immutability.\u0026nbspIn his leisure hours, Smith also likes to get his hands dirty and repair and ride old motorbikes. He has one dating back to the 1920s, a BSA, still rideable, but\u0026nbsp“only short distances”. This explains the\u0026nbspT-shirt.

It\u0027s time to consider a change in approachClick to followThe IndependentHMRC has been given extra resources to tackle non payment of the minimum wage The problem with the welcome war between Labour and the Conservatives over minimum wage rates is that it means nothing if employers ignore them.\u0026nbspAccording to the Low Pay Commission, a record number of people were underpaid last year by those that chose to do just that.\u0026nbspIn a report published just a few weeks after the minimum wage celebrated its 20 year anniversary, it put the number at 439,000\u0026nbspand rising.\u0026nbsp\u0027Worrying\u0027 rise in number of people being paid below minimum wageMinimum wage at 20: Too many employers still trying to get around itTwenty years on, the national minimum wage is a successYounger workers were particularly vulnerable, even though employers are allowed to pay them less. Ditto women. The report tagged childcare as the occupation with the highest proportion of underpaid workers, with hospitality and retail, which similarly employ an unusually high proportion of female workers, also high on the list.\u0026nbspBut hang on a second, I hear you say. Wasn’t HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs (HMRC) given a bunch of extra cash by the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to bring enforcement actions?\u0026nbspThat is indeed the case, as BEIS was keen to stress in response to the report. And there is evidence that it is having results. HMRC identified an all-time high number of workers as underpaid in the 2017-18 financial year, securing pay rises and arrears for them while also levying fines.\u0026nbspYet the number of cases overall stood still. The figures were driven by a relatively small number of big cases.\u0026nbspWhat this tells you is that HMRC is deploying its resources where it can get the most bang for its buck.\u0026nbspAn eminently sensible policy given that its budget is not unlimited, even after the increases it has enjoyed and the complexities and expense involved in investigating underpayment – and bringing miscreant employers to book.The trouble is that this is inevitably going to lead to a long tail of often smaller employers that are cheating the system and may justifiably feel there is little risk to them in doing so.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Sometimes it can be as simple as delaying the introduction of new rates. Sometimes it’s a lot worse than that.\u0026nbspHelpfully the commission, which also advises on the rates themselves, has some sensible ideas for addressing the issue, which can be summarised as calling for a more holistic approach.\u0026nbspAs part of this, it wants to see more investment in communicating with workers, and employers, together with efforts to build confidence in complaints processes, and to help workers to use them.\u0026nbspIt would also like government to work more closely with unions, which obviously have considerable expertise in this area through the work they do for low paid members and could provide a great deal of assistance.\u0026nbspCheating the minimum wage not only cheats workers. It cheats the competitors of businesses that fail to pay it by disadvantaging them.\u0026nbspIn treating unions as the enemy, as the Conservative government is frequently guilty of doing, it risks undermining the success of one of its flagship policies.

But it’s only recently that everyone has been able to see what the store has in stock\u0026nbspfor them.Kibworth\u0026nbspBooks is among hundreds of independent UK booksellers who have started using NearSt technology, which allows small retailers to compete with Amazon by making their inventory visible in online searches. As well as listing stock online for potential customers to browse, NearSt has an add-on feature that makes the store appear in searches when people in the area Google the specific title they want.Retailers say high street footfall up March but shoppers didn’t spend Debenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Government must protect British retailers from giants like Amazon“Now we have 8,000 titles findable by people who are walking past the shop, or in the pub three minutes down the road,” says Debbie James, who started Kibworth Books when she left the music industry 10 years ago. “They can Google a book from the pub and our shop will come up before Amazon, Waterstones and WHSmith.”NearSt was founded by Max Kreijn and Nick Brackenbury in 2015 with one mission: to get more people into high street shops. The startup comes at a time of rapid change for UK high streets. More than 30 major retailers have shut since Woolworths closed in 2008, according to the ONS. Job losses from the retail sector are expected to rise nearly 20 per cent in 2019, putting 164,000 people out of work and leading to the closure of a further 22,000 stores, according to the Centre for Retail Research.It’s an interesting time in retail,” Brackenbury says. “I think the high street has a ton of value but it needs to be unlocked.”Brackenbury and Kreijn met 10 years ago when they were working together at Ogilvy, the advertising agency. Brackenbury was a graduate trainee and Kreijn was a strategist in a small team of three or four people doing early social analytics.\u0026nbspNot long after, Kreijn left the firm to start his own company, an innovation consultancy helping big companies behave more like startups. He was spending a lot of time working out how big companies could take old assets and come up with something new, when he had a “literal lightbulb moment” – a lightbulb in his living room blew, and when he Googled for a replacement, the search threw up online shops, rather than stores near him.The next time Kreijn saw Brackenbury, he pitched him the lightbulb problem: how could they unlock the retail industry’s massive stock inventory, and make it available in the place where most people were starting to shop – online?\u0026nbsp“I told him I was sure someone had figured out his problem already,” Brackenbury says. “But when I looked at it I thought, ‘My god, why hasn’t anyone done this?’ And it turns out no one has done this because it is quite hard.”The technology developed by NearSt echoes work by Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China, which has been converting 100,000 retail stores into Alibaba-linked smart stores. Customers in these smart stores are able to source products missing in some stores from others nearby, so they know where to look next – or where to order the product for home delivery.NearSt has had early success with booksellers as many of them use the same book supplier, Gardners Books, which makes it easy for NearSt to digitise the inventory used by multiple independent stores. But it is much more of a challenge to digitise and extract the data from hundreds of thousands of small shops.\u0026nbsp“The inventory is locked away in these archaic inventory systems that weren’t built for the modern world,” Brackenbury says. “So if you search for a product on your phone, it shows you hundreds of products in warehouses up the M1 corridor, even though you could be stood outside a shop that sells that very same product and you just don’t know about it. That seems bonkers.”NearSt has developed software to extract and understand rudimentary stock data and feed it into the internet, so that Google doesn’t just show online results, but also local availability.\u0026nbspIf an online inventory is the best way for retailers to take back the bite of their profit stolen by Amazon, why haven’t more done it? “The data challenge is hard for a retailer to do,” Brackenbury says. Many companies that do have digital inventories are using mainframe technology that was built in 1988. Even after the store has established a barcode, a stock level and a price, they must also have pictures, product descriptions and titles before it can be listed as a product online.\u0026nbsp“It’s a huge ask, and they’re busy so they don’t do it,” Brackenbury says. “We connect into old systems, extract information, understand what it is and enrich it so the retailer doesn’t have to do anything. They keep managing the inventory in the same way, but we make it visible on the web.”Last year, NearSt was approached by a Google employee who explained that the search company wanted to list local inventory. “It’s an incredible way for us to make a huge impact,” Brackenbury says of the partnership. “We looked at who we wanted to feed data into, and then Google came to us and said they could feed it into the world’s biggest search engine – that’s the way to achieve that mission.”The company has raised £1.5m to date and is in the middle of another funding round. Brackenbury knows that as the company’s mission grows, it must do what it can to safeguard the privacy of stores. He imagines opening inventory data to other technology companies, like Facebook and Uber, so that users can get instant delivery of branded spirits from local stores by nearby couriers, for instance. But he says this would have to be done with the consent of the retailers, so their inventory only appears when they want it to.At Kibworth Books, James say the decision to sign up to NearSt was a “no brainer”. She recently paid an extra £2 a day for the store to appear in local Google searches for titles around World Book Day. “I did it for two weeks to get my shop out there when families who weren’t aware of us were searching where to get the books from,” she says. “Looking at the statistics it was worth it, you can safely say footfall increased.”Independent bookshops on the rise for the second year runningBrackenbury meanwhile says that in a few years, live inventory technology will be so commonplace we will wonder how we ever did without it: “Within three or four years, this real time local inventory will seem completely normal to us in the same way that now\u0026nbspif you look up on your phone what time Boots shuts, Google tells you the closing time for the nearest store. Four years ago that didn’t exist,” he says. Whether it can save the high street remains to be seen.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You’ll still be able to spend a penny under this government.”Last year the Treasury announced a consultation into the use of cash in the “new economy” in which an increasing number of people were making digital payments.It stated that eight per cent of copper coins were thrown away while 60 per cent were used just once before landing in jars. The shortfall meant the need to produce more than 500 million 1p and 2p coins to replace those that fell out of circulation.But the government backtracked within 24 hours of making the surprise threat when PM Theresa May announced the coins will not be scrapped. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Buster the Golden Retriever, belonging to David Torrance MSP, at this year\u0027s Holyrood Dog of the Year competition, organised jointly by Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club at the Scottish Parliament Gardens in Edinburgh.Liverpool\u0027s Virgil van Dijk poses with his PFA Player of the Year award Cyclists lay down as they take part in the Extinction Rebellion protest at the Tate Modern in London, BritainLiberal Democratic Party leader Vince Cable speaks at a launch event for the party\u0027s candidates for the European Parliament election in LondonExtinction Rebellion protesters (left to right) Alan Heath, 55, research scientist, Jen Witts, 38, support worker for vulnerable people, Sian Vaughan 53, retired head teacher, Debbie Rees, 57, Gardener and artist, Kef Shimidzu, 55, tutor and learning support worker, Lucy Galvin, 53, civil servant and Johnny Woon, 60, retired, glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange in the City of LondonEngineers from the Canal and River Trust repair a leak at the base of a deep 200 year old, Grade II listed lock in Gloucester, where the tidal River Severn meets Gloucester Docks in the city and a specially manufactured steel dam is now holding back the river water, with more than 100 tonnes of accumulated silt being removed from the damaged area of the lock so that the team can undertake repairsAmateur James Cahill celebrates beating snooker world number one, Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan, in the first round of the World Championship.

While supporters say consumers get a better deal, critics argue that there is no place for profit in public services.Now, with Labour gaining in the polls and a general election seen as more likely following a delay to Brexit, companies and investors are taking the possibility of nationalisation seriously.Thames Water, for example, added a clause to its bonds to ensure holders are repaid immediately should it be nationalised.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Buster the Golden Retriever, belonging to David Torrance MSP, at this year\u0027s Holyrood Dog of the Year competition, organised jointly by Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club at the Scottish Parliament Gardens in Edinburgh.Liverpool\u0027s Virgil van Dijk poses with his PFA Player of the Year award Cyclists lay down as they take part in the Extinction Rebellion protest at the Tate Modern in London, BritainLiberal Democratic Party leader Vince Cable speaks at a launch event for the party\u0027s candidates for the European Parliament election in LondonExtinction Rebellion protesters (left to right) Alan Heath, 55, research scientist, Jen Witts, 38, support worker for vulnerable people, Sian Vaughan 53, retired head teacher, Debbie Rees, 57, Gardener and artist, Kef Shimidzu, 55, tutor and learning support worker, Lucy Galvin, 53, civil servant and Johnny Woon, 60, retired, glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange in the City of LondonEngineers from the Canal and River Trust repair a leak at the base of a deep 200 year old, Grade II listed lock in Gloucester, where the tidal River Severn meets Gloucester Docks in the city and a specially manufactured steel dam is now holding back the river water, with more than 100 tonnes of accumulated silt being removed from the damaged area of the lock so that the team can undertake repairsAmateur James Cahill celebrates beating snooker world number one, Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan, in the first round of the World Championship.

Lawyers say\u0026nbspthis process is\u0026nbspcontinuing.“Your biggest fear as a bond investor is if your bond gets nationalised for less than market value,” Dan Neidle, partner at Clifford Chance, says.“Labour have said they will honour the debts of nationalised businesses, but a large number of investors and infrastructure businesses remain concerned. The discussions we are having are increasing over time,” Neidle adds, without giving any names.“We have seen some foreign investors hold their hands up and say we are not looking at UK infrastructure,” says\u0026nbspone London-based banker. “There were a lot of questions about Corbyn on the roadshow.”But can investors really insure against nationalisation?Some say a Labour government could simply change the law to annul a Thames Water-type provision and swap any cash due for government-issued gilts.“It is probably impossible to ‘Corbyn-proof’\u0026nbspa corporate’s debt in this way,” one capital markets lawyer says.Harry Richards, who co-manages Jupiter Asset Management’s Corporate Bond Fund, says\u0026nbspthat whatever it may say before an election, a Labour government may ultimately not want to risk undermining business confidence with a change to the law.“Historically the UK has been viewed as a bit of a golden child in terms of enforceability of UK law and how the UK law is valued ... it would very much undermine that.”Nevertheless, Richards went underweight in British utilities midway through last year, arguing that nationalisation risk means they are no longer a safe bet.Another factor which may make Labour think twice about a wide nationalisation plan is the expense.Water company shareholders collect £6.5bn in idends and interestS\u0026ampP Global puts the cost of taking the water and power sectors back into state hands at some £160bn, based on the regulated asset value of the companies.A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The benefits of taking water into public ownership are clear: ending rip-off prices and excessive idends for private companies and investing in the long-term future of our economy.”While it is difficult to disentangle the Corbyn effect on share and debt prices from the impact of Brexit or regulatory squeezes, analysts say it is definitely there among utilities, which comprise\u0026nbspabout a fifth of the UK corporate bond market.Credit Suisse strategist Mark Freshney notes\u0026nbspshares in utilities fell by about\u0026nbsp35 per cent in the nine months after Labour outlined its plans in May 2017.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsLabour ‘could nationalise railways in five years’Water industry must fix its leaky performanceThis latest rail chaos will fuel talk of nationalisationLabour’s nationalisation plans as dangerous as hard Brexit, says CBI“The nationalisation debate has taken something like 10-15 per cent off the share prices,” Freshney says. “At the moment there is probably a 5-7.5 per cent discount in the shares.”Any Corbyn discount is most visible in bonds issued in a holding company structure often used by utilities to raise debt.These “holdcos” are unsecured, lack operating licences and assets and their bonds\u0026nbsprank lower than the operating companies, known as “opcos”.Jonathan Constable, an analyst at Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management, estimates that UK-regulated opco debt is in the region of £70-100bn, and holdco debt –\u0026nbspthe most vulnerable category –\u0026nbspequates to just 5 per cent of that.Created with Sketch.The most ridiculous claims made about Jeremy Corbyn Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 He called Hezbollah and Hamas ‘friends’True. In a speech made to the Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Mr Corbyn called representatives from both groups “friends” after inviting them to Parliament.211 ‘Jeremy Corbyn thinks the death of Osama bin Laden was a tragedy’Partly false. David Cameron used this as a line of attack at the Conservative Party conference but appears to have left out all context from Mr Corbyn’s original remarks.311 He is ‘haunted’ by the legacy of his ‘evil’ great-great-grandfatherFalse. A  exposé revealed that the Labour leader’s ancestor, James Sargent, was the “despotic” master of a Victorian workhouse.411 Jeremy Corbyn raised a motion about ‘pigeon bombs’ in ParliamentThis one is true. On 21 May 2004, Mr Corbyn raised an early day motion entitled “pigeon bombs”, proposing that the House register being “appalled but barely surprised” that MI5 reportedly proposed to load pigeons with explosives as a weapon.False. A report in The Times referred to Mr Corbyn, known for his cycling, riding a “Chairman Mao-style bicycle” earlier this year.611 \u0027Jeremy Corbyn will appoint a special minister for Jews\u0027False so far. The Sun report in December was allegedly based on a “rumour” passed to the paper by a  columnist who has written pieces critical of the Labour leader in the past. The minister did not materialise in his shadow cabinet.711 ‘Jeremy Corbyn wishes Britain would abolish its Army’False. Another gem from The Sun took comments made at a Hiroshima remembrance parade in August 2012 where Mr Corbyn supported Costa Rica’s move to abolish it armed forces.811 Jeremy Corbyn stole sandwiches meant for veterans False. The Guido Fawkes blog claimed that the Labour leader took sandwiches meant for veterans at at Battle of Britain memorial service in September but a photo later emerged showing him being handed one by Costa volunteers, who later confirmed they were given to all guests.911 He missed the induction into the Queen’s privy councilTrue. After much speculation about Mr Corbyn’s republican views and willingness to bow to the monarch, his office confirmed that he did not attend the official induction to the privy council because of a prior engagement, but did not rule out joining the body.1011 Jeremy Corbyn refuses to sing the national anthem.Partly true. The Labour leader was filmed standing in silence as God Save the Queen was sung at a Battle of Britain remembrance service but will reportedly sing it in future.1111 He is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for CheeseTrue. The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”111 He called Hezbollah and Hamas ‘friends’True. In a speech made to the Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Mr Corbyn called representatives from both groups “friends” after inviting them to Parliament.211 ‘Jeremy Corbyn thinks the death of Osama bin Laden was a tragedy’Partly false.

A  exposé revealed that the Labour leader’s ancestor, James Sargent, was the “despotic” master of a Victorian workhouse.411 Jeremy Corbyn raised a motion about ‘pigeon bombs’ in ParliamentThis one is true. On 21 May 2004, Mr Corbyn raised an early day motion entitled “pigeon bombs”, proposing that the House register being “appalled but barely surprised” that MI5 reportedly proposed to load pigeons with explosives as a weapon.False. A report in The Times referred to Mr Corbyn, known for his cycling, riding a “Chairman Mao-style bicycle” earlier this year.611 \u0027Jeremy Corbyn will appoint a special minister for Jews\u0027False so far. The Sun report in December was allegedly based on a “rumour” passed to the paper by a  columnist who has written pieces critical of the Labour leader in the past. The minister did not materialise in his shadow cabinet.711 ‘Jeremy Corbyn wishes Britain would abolish its Army’False. Another gem from The Sun took comments made at a Hiroshima remembrance parade in August 2012 where Mr Corbyn supported Costa Rica’s move to abolish it armed forces.811 Jeremy Corbyn stole sandwiches meant for veterans False. The Guido Fawkes blog claimed that the Labour leader took sandwiches meant for veterans at at Battle of Britain memorial service in September but a photo later emerged showing him being handed one by Costa volunteers, who later confirmed they were given to all guests.911 He missed the induction into the Queen’s privy councilTrue. After much speculation about Mr Corbyn’s republican views and willingness to bow to the monarch, his office confirmed that he did not attend the official induction to the privy council because of a prior engagement, but did not rule out joining the body.1011 Jeremy Corbyn refuses to sing the national anthem.Partly true. The Labour leader was filmed standing in silence as God Save the Queen was sung at a Battle of Britain remembrance service but will reportedly sing it in future.1111 He is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for CheeseTrue. The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”“We have a preference for opco debt, which is safer in a nationalisation event, it could be viewed as a government proxy in event of a nationalisation, in which case the price could go up,” Jupiter’s Richards says.This dichotomy is visible in bonds from Anglian Water and its holdco Osprey Finance. Similarly, Kelda Finance has seen its bonds underperform that of its opco Yorkshire Water.“It’s largely down to people refusing to invest as long as the nationalisation overhang is there,” says\u0026nbspConstable.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It led to fears Apple was acting to benefit itself, since it makes its own screen time tracking tools.The company said that it was taking the apps away – but that it was doing so to protect its users\u0027 privacy, not itself.The original report had claimed the tech firm had forced a number of parental control apps to remove key features in the last year, or removed them entirely with little warning.It said 11 of the 17 most popular apps in this category had been taken down or restricted in the 12 months.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Contrary to what the New York Times reported over the weekend, this isn\u0027t a matter of competition, it\u0027s a matter of security, a company statement said.In this app category, and in every category, we are committed to providing a competitive, innovative app ecosystem.There are many tremendously successful apps that offer functions and services similar to Apple\u0027s in categories like messaging, maps, email, music, web browsers, photos, note-taking apps, contact managers and payment systems, just to name a few.We are committed to offering a place for these apps to thrive as they improve the user experience for everyone.The firm said it had concerns over a technology known as Mobile Device Management (MDM), which gives control of a device to a third party.Apple said it acknowledged that this technology did have legitimate uses in some business settings, but said its use in consumer apps was a clear violation of its App Store policies.Beyond the control that the app itself can exert over the user\u0027s device, research has shown that MDM profiles could be used by hackers to gain access for malicious purposes, the company said.Parents shouldn\u0027t have to trade their fears of their children\u0027s device usage for risks to privacy and security, and the App Store should not be a platform to force this choice. No-one, except you, should have unrestricted access to manage your child\u0027s device.Last month, Spotify confirmed it had reported Apple to European regulators over what it claimed were anti-competitive practices in the way it managed some payments made through the App Store, accusing the firm of using the store it to give its own Apple Music service an advantage over Spotify\u0027s rival app.In response, the iPhone maker claimed Spotify had wrapped financial motivations in misleading rhetoric.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You’ll still be able to spend a penny under this government.”Last year the Treasury announced a consultation into the use of cash in the “new economy” in which an increasing number of people were making digital payments.It stated that eight per cent of copper coins were thrown away while 60 per cent were used just once before landing in jars. The shortfall meant the need to produce more than 500 million 1p and 2p coins to replace those that fell out of circulation.But the government backtracked within 24 hours of making the surprise threat when PM Theresa May announced the coins will not be scrapped. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Buster the Golden Retriever, belonging to David Torrance MSP, at this year\u0027s Holyrood Dog of the Year competition, organised jointly by Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club at the Scottish Parliament Gardens in Edinburgh.Liverpool\u0027s Virgil van Dijk poses with his PFA Player of the Year award Cyclists lay down as they take part in the Extinction Rebellion protest at the Tate Modern in London, BritainLiberal Democratic Party leader Vince Cable speaks at a launch event for the party\u0027s candidates for the European Parliament election in LondonExtinction Rebellion protesters (left to right) Alan Heath, 55, research scientist, Jen Witts, 38, support worker for vulnerable people, Sian Vaughan 53, retired head teacher, Debbie Rees, 57, Gardener and artist, Kef Shimidzu, 55, tutor and learning support worker, Lucy Galvin, 53, civil servant and Johnny Woon, 60, retired, glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange in the City of LondonEngineers from the Canal and River Trust repair a leak at the base of a deep 200 year old, Grade II listed lock in Gloucester, where the tidal River Severn meets Gloucester Docks in the city and a specially manufactured steel dam is now holding back the river water, with more than 100 tonnes of accumulated silt being removed from the damaged area of the lock so that the team can undertake repairsAmateur James Cahill celebrates beating snooker world number one, Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan, in the first round of the World Championship.

Members are saying they want us to oppose Brexit full stop, and they want a confirmatory vote as a minimum.He said\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s constructive ambiguity on Europe had\u0026nbspled to the formation of The Independent Group and accused Mr Corbyn\u0027s team of failing\u0026nbspto react to the creation of the new party.The Independent\u0026nbspis campaigning for a Final Say vote on any Brexit deal\u0026nbspagreed by parliament.118 Labour MPs and MEPs\u0026nbsphave now signed a letter urging the NEC to include in the manifesto a clear commitment to a public vote on any Brexit deal.The letter says:\u0026nbspWe need a message of hope and solidarity, and we need to campaign for it without caveats. To motivate our supporters, and to do the right thing by our members and our policy, a clear commitment to a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal must be part of our European election manifesto.We understand the many different pressures and views within our movement, but without this clear commitment, we fear that our electoral coalition could fall apart.In a\u0026nbspseparate letter, more than 30 Welsh MPs, assembly members, councillors and trade unionists urged\u0026nbspthe Welsh NEC representative\u0026nbspto unequivocally back a manifesto that includes a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal agreed in this parliament, with an option to Remain.Mallon calls for second Brexit referendumMore than 20 Labour European Parliament candidates also\u0026nbspsaid they would\u0026nbspcampaign for another referendum regardless of the party\u0027s official policy.As pressure mounted on the party leadership to fully endorse a Final Say vote, Mr Watson wrote on Twitter: Labour member or supporter? Please let your reps on the NEC know if you want them to support a confirmatory ballot on a brexit deal in our Euro manifesto.The comment prompted a backlash from some other NEC members supportive of Mr Corbyn. Claudia Webbe, who chairs the committee\u0027s\u0026nbspdisciplinary panel, told Mr Watson:\u0026nbsp“Our number one priority should be for a democratic socialist Labour government to deliver a sustained and\u0026nbspirreversible shift in wealth and\u0026nbsppower in the UK.“Supporting Jeremy Corbyn and\u0026nbspthe Labour Party to achieve this to kick out the Tories should be your focus.”Another NEC member, Pete Willsman, mockingly compared Mr Watson to Ramsay McDonald, the first Labour prime minister, who became\u0026nbspa figure of hate in the party after forming a government of national unity with the Conservatives.\u0026nbspMr Willsman tweeted: What is the difference\u0026nbspbetween Ramsay MacDonald and Tommy Watson? Answer: the man from Lossiemouth had a firm grasp of loyalty.But Mr Watson was backed by\u0026nbspMomentum chairman Jon Lansman, who also sits on the NEC. He\u0026nbspwrote on Twitter: At conference we agreed: \u0027If the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.’ So surely we too can all agree to a confirmatory vote on any government\u0026nbspdeal in our manifesto!”Demands for the party to support a referendum on any Brexit deal were echoed by the general secretaries of four leading trade unions.\u0026nbspUnison\u0027s Dave Prentis said: “The prime minister’s deal and a no-deal Brexit would be terrible for the UK, public services and working people.“A package that protects peace in Northern Ireland, keeps the UK in a customs union with a close relationship to the single market, and protects future employment rights isn’t on the table.\u0026nbsp That’s why any final proposal must be put back to the country for voters to decide.”\u0026nbspBrexit pushes thousands of firms into ‘critical’ financial distressQueen\u0027s Speech to be delayed until Brexit delivered, May saysLabour MEP candidates sign pledge to campaign for Final Say referendumConservatives face losing more than 800 seats in local electionsThe GMB\u0027s Tim Roache told the Evening Standard:\u0026nbsp“It must be the public who have the final say on Brexit. A grubby political stitch-up to meet the needs of internal Tory party politics, rather than the best interests of our country, won’t put this question to bed for a minute, let alone a generation.”\u0026nbspTSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes\u0026nbspsaid it was time for our party to act on the overwhelming wishes of its members , while Usdaw\u0027s\u0026nbspPaddy Lillis said: “If our politicians are confident that their deal will benefit working people, our economy and communities across the country, then they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While supporters say consumers get a better deal, critics argue that there is no place for profit in public services.Now, with Labour gaining in the polls and a general election seen as more likely following a delay to Brexit, companies and investors are taking the possibility of nationalisation seriously.Thames Water, for example, added a clause to its bonds to ensure holders are repaid immediately should it be nationalised.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Buster the Golden Retriever, belonging to David Torrance MSP, at this year\u0027s Holyrood Dog of the Year competition, organised jointly by Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club at the Scottish Parliament Gardens in Edinburgh.Liverpool\u0027s Virgil van Dijk poses with his PFA Player of the Year award Cyclists lay down as they take part in the Extinction Rebellion protest at the Tate Modern in London, BritainLiberal Democratic Party leader Vince Cable speaks at a launch event for the party\u0027s candidates for the European Parliament election in LondonExtinction Rebellion protesters (left to right) Alan Heath, 55, research scientist, Jen Witts, 38, support worker for vulnerable people, Sian Vaughan 53, retired head teacher, Debbie Rees, 57, Gardener and artist, Kef Shimidzu, 55, tutor and learning support worker, Lucy Galvin, 53, civil servant and Johnny Woon, 60, retired, glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange in the City of LondonEngineers from the Canal and River Trust repair a leak at the base of a deep 200 year old, Grade II listed lock in Gloucester, where the tidal River Severn meets Gloucester Docks in the city and a specially manufactured steel dam is now holding back the river water, with more than 100 tonnes of accumulated silt being removed from the damaged area of the lock so that the team can undertake repairsAmateur James Cahill celebrates beating snooker world number one, Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan, in the first round of the World Championship.

Lawyers say\u0026nbspthis process is\u0026nbspcontinuing.“Your biggest fear as a bond investor is if your bond gets nationalised for less than market value,” Dan Neidle, partner at Clifford Chance, says.“Labour have said they will honour the debts of nationalised businesses, but a large number of investors and infrastructure businesses remain concerned. The discussions we are having are increasing over time,” Neidle adds, without giving any names.“We have seen some foreign investors hold their hands up and say we are not looking at UK infrastructure,” says\u0026nbspone London-based banker. “There were a lot of questions about Corbyn on the roadshow.”But can investors really insure against nationalisation?Some say a Labour government could simply change the law to annul a Thames Water-type provision and swap any cash due for government-issued gilts.“It is probably impossible to ‘Corbyn-proof’\u0026nbspa corporate’s debt in this way,” one capital markets lawyer says.Harry Richards, who co-manages Jupiter Asset Management’s Corporate Bond Fund, says\u0026nbspthat whatever it may say before an election, a Labour government may ultimately not want to risk undermining business confidence with a change to the law.“Historically the UK has been viewed as a bit of a golden child in terms of enforceability of UK law and how the UK law is valued ... it would very much undermine that.”Nevertheless, Richards went underweight in British utilities midway through last year, arguing that nationalisation risk means they are no longer a safe bet.Another factor which may make Labour think twice about a wide nationalisation plan is the expense.Water company shareholders collect £6.5bn in idends and interestS\u0026ampP Global puts the cost of taking the water and power sectors back into state hands at some £160bn, based on the regulated asset value of the companies.A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The benefits of taking water into public ownership are clear: ending rip-off prices and excessive idends for private companies and investing in the long-term future of our economy.”While it is difficult to disentangle the Corbyn effect on share and debt prices from the impact of Brexit or regulatory squeezes, analysts say it is definitely there among utilities, which comprise\u0026nbspabout a fifth of the UK corporate bond market.Credit Suisse strategist Mark Freshney notes\u0026nbspshares in utilities fell by about\u0026nbsp35 per cent in the nine months after Labour outlined its plans in May 2017.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsLabour ‘could nationalise railways in five years’Water industry must fix its leaky performanceThis latest rail chaos will fuel talk of nationalisationLabour’s nationalisation plans as dangerous as hard Brexit, says CBI“The nationalisation debate has taken something like 10-15 per cent off the share prices,” Freshney says. “At the moment there is probably a 5-7.5 per cent discount in the shares.”Any Corbyn discount is most visible in bonds issued in a holding company structure often used by utilities to raise debt.These “holdcos” are unsecured, lack operating licences and assets and their bonds\u0026nbsprank lower than the operating companies, known as “opcos”.Jonathan Constable, an analyst at Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management, estimates that UK-regulated opco debt is in the region of £70-100bn, and holdco debt –\u0026nbspthe most vulnerable category –\u0026nbspequates to just 5 per cent of that.Created with Sketch.The most ridiculous claims made about Jeremy Corbyn Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 He called Hezbollah and Hamas ‘friends’True.

David Cameron used this as a line of attack at the Conservative Party conference but appears to have left out all context from Mr Corbyn’s original remarks.311 He is ‘haunted’ by the legacy of his ‘evil’ great-great-grandfatherFalse.

And while police deemed it impractical for some celebrities to join queues which formed well before polling stations opened at 7am, not every star opted for the VIP treatment.Award-winning actor Ranveer Singh, who is married to India’s highest-paid actress\u0026nbspDeepika Padukone, posed for selfies with fans while he waited in line to vote with his father. Among those stopping him for a picture were the police officers responsible for securing the polling station.\u0026nbspDeepika Padukone, shows an ink mark on her finger after casting her vote at a polling station in Mumbai (Reuters)Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar voted alongside his wife Anjali and their two children, both first-time voters, telling reporters: “I think that every citizen should come out and vote. It is very important for our country.”As well as the huge Hindi film industry, the financial capital Mumbai is home to seven of India’s 19 richest people. But about 60 per cent of the population lives in its growing slums, and for ordinary voters there are major concerns about jobs and crumbling infrastructure.Only last month six people died when part of a pedestrian bridge collapsed, recalling memories of a 2017 rush-hour stampede that killed at least 22 people at a suburban railway station.TikTok ban in India overturned after reassurances over porn videosIs India’s economic growth really all down to Modi? Man ‘chops off own finger’ after mistakenly voting for wrong candidateIndian election workers travel 300 miles so that one person can voteIn India’s election, peace cannot be taken for grantedAnkita Bhavke, a student and first-time voter, said\u0026nbspshe wanted first and foremost to see development. “I want the country to be at par with the best in the world,” she said, while admitting there had been “some progress” in the last five years under Narendra Modi.For Mr Modi, the results from Monday’s 72 constituencies will be one of the clearest drivers of whether or not he returns for a second term.His ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took more than 75 per cent of these seats at the last election in 2014. But the party suffered shock defeats in these same states – Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, and Rajasthan – in December local elections.Mr Modi has been attacked because of\u0026nbsphis record on employment and farmers’ welfare, issues\u0026nbspthe main opposition party, Indian National\u0026nbspCongress, has seized upon.To counter Congress’s momentum since the start of the year, the BJP has focused all its energy on making national security the main factor in making up the mind of the public.At a rally in Mumbai on Friday, Mr Modi – who has nicknamed himself the country’s “chowkidar” or “watchman” – said only the BJP could guarantee the safety of the city, a reference to a major terror attack\u0026nbsp10 years ago.“Modi is confident those who strike with terror on this city will be hunted down,” he said, referring to himself in the third person. “That is how a city and that is how a country is run.”There were also seats up for grabs on Monday in West Bengal, which has already seen some of the worst of the violence in what has otherwise been a mostly peaceful democratic exercise.Police broke up clashes again between rival groups of voters in the key eastern state, as BJP supporters clashed with the powerful regional party All India\u0026nbspTrinamool Congress.TV footage showed armed security forces chasing away people wielding sticks, although it was initially difficult to determine the scale of the clashes, and as of late Monday afternoon there were no reports of poll-related injuries. At least one person was killed and three injured during the third phase of voting in West Bengal last week.The election, the world’s biggest with about 900 million eligible voters, began on 11 April with polls suggesting Mr Modi is still favourite to win, albeit with a reduced majority.There are 545 seats being contested in total, and the last phase of voting will conclude on 19 May\u0026nbspwith results counted and released four days later.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Salvini was tagged in the post.\u0026nbspThe viral image was widely shared after Italian activist Marco Furfaro posted it on Facebook alongside the caption: “Caltanissetta protesters. Love beats hate 3-0. Trolling Salvini to the extreme. You rock Gaia and Matilde.”The hashtag #GaiaeMatilde – the names of the two young women in the photo – has gained traction on Twitter.Gaia can be seen appearing to attempt to take another photo kissing her friend after taking the first one but a security agent appears to swiftly place their hand in the way in order to separate the two young women.“The hand of another friend that ides,” says the caption of an image which can be seen on her Instagram Stories.Mr Salvini has been mocked in the wake of the image – with an influx of memes\u0026nbsppoking fun at the expression on his face. Others have hailed the women’s “brave” and “glorious” protest.“When the minister urged those present to take the stage and take a selfie with him, we had this idea because he participated in World Congress of Families as a minister,” Gaia, who has only been identified by her first name, told Euronews.\u0026nbsp“We made a provocative instinctive gesture, not at all premeditated. On stage, Salvini did not expect us to take a picture like this. When we kissed, an agent I think, separated us sharply and Salvini then told us ‘I wish you luck’ so we took off thanking him ironically.”Campaigners argue women’s rights are being rolled back\u0026nbspunder Mr Salvini and\u0026nbsptraditional stereotypes about the role of women are also worsening.The political leader was fiercely criticised after neither he nor any Minister from the League chose to attend national celebrations which sees Italy mark\u0026nbspthe liberation from fascism on 25 April each year.Campaigners protest against \u0027medieval\u0027 anti-abortion summit in ItalyLast week, Italian media documented neo-fascist demonstrations, desecrations of memorials of participants of the Italian resistance against fascism, and drawings of swastikas across the country.

Without treatment, up to  per cent of people with serious eating disorders die.The condition can affect anyone at any time, but girls and young women aged - are found to be most at risk.Here, Sun Online investigates the disturbing new trend.Teens looking to encourage each other in their eating disorders regularly use social media to look for ana buddies  or ana coaches - ana being short for anorexic - before setting up private pro-ana groups on messaging apps.One Twitter user we found - who claims to be just  - outlines the diet she’s promoting for members of her Kik group.Inviting young teens age  or above to jointhey have an eating disorder,  recommends a schedule including one fast day, and one day of  calories.According to NHS guidelines, a girl of this age should have , calories a day.A quick search for the term ana on Kik reveals a whole array of public groups seemingly promoting eating disorders.One public group’ species it’s for people aged  plus and has  members. One Instagram user, who says she is , has a photo feed littered with dangerously underweight girls. Commenting on someone s photo she pleads: Is anyone a coach here I need one.She is inundated with offers that move to private message.While it’s no secret Twitter has an issue with trolls, alarmingly some eating disorder sufferers are actively seeking out meanspo - translated as mean inspiration from coaches- specically asking strangers for vicious insults in a bid to encourage them to starve to reach their goal weight.One of these coaches posted: “Im borderline abusive but I dont care. If youre looking to lose weight come to me. You must be willing to do literally anything. Youll be considered nothing but a piece of meat.Another coach on Twitter told her followers that theyd be pretty and would have lost the fat on their body by nowthey just exercised more.  Disturbingly, her followers responded gratefully, saying thank you and asking her to coach them, with one saying theyd be grateful for more meanspo.When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson said: We allow this type of conversation on Twitter so long as its people reaching out to support others who may be struggling with these issues. If the conversation promotes or glories this type of behaviour, wed take action.Our investigation also found that teens and young people in the throes of anorexia are also using fasting apps to form groups which encourage weight loss, with apps available for download to anyone aged  or over.The apps are being used by those suffering with the disease, who are then posting screenshots of their progress.One app, the LIFE Fasting Tracker - rated + on the App Store  - allows users to create profiles, track weight losses and form groups where other users can share their progress and have it displayed in a leaderboard.By searching trigger words within the app, multiple groups promoting eating disorders and extreme weight loss are promoted.  One group contains  members and has a description which says “I do this to be skinny”. The description of a group with over  members, says: “Only for serious weight loss, cheekbones, colorbones [sic] and rib cages”.At least five groups which contained references to anorexia or bulimia are active on the app.One Twitter user shared a screenshot from the app showing that they had completed a nearly three day long fast. The app shared a message of “congratulations!” when she’d successfully completed the time.Another app - the Zero Fasting Tracker- with the same age ratings displays a screen which reads “we’re designed to fast” upon first use.Screenshots of the app have been posted to the Twitter accounts of social media users who regularly use anorexia related hashtags. When installing the app, our journalist indicated that they were  years old when prompted to enter date of birth, and they were granted access to multiple fasting options.Sun Online have reached out to Zero Fasting Tracker for comment, and Justin Helmig, Chief Marketing Officer, for LIFE Apps said: We absolutely discourage eating disorders, thats why education through our app and website is such a crucial pillar to our community.  We have tools in place to monitor and curate inappropriate groups as well as enable users to report inappropriate content and do not condone any unsafe behaviour no matter the age. Additionally, our Terms and Conditions discourages a iety of groups from participating in intermittent fasting, including minors and those with eating disorders. While Instagram have made attempts to remove certain hashtags, within seconds of searching for pro-anorexia hashtags we still found numerous posts advertising eating disorder coaching.One Instagram user advertised their help with a photo reading: “I’m a male Ana-coach. I’m strict and harsh. I’m borderline abusive but I don’t care.”Underneath it said: “If you consider this too extreme don’t even message me, just keep stuffing your fat f**king face with food and keep scrolling.”And while we found a warning message by Instagram does pop upusers search for damaging hashtags, posts looking for ana buddies are also still accessible.One post still available to view says: “Need a strong ana buddy who will push me to starve and lose more weight! I’ll do the same for you. Dm meyou want to! Please help”.When contacted an Instagram spokesperson said: “We do not and have never allowed content that encourages or promotes eating disorders and will remove it as soon as we are made aware. We know many people recovering from eating disorders use Instagram in a positive way to get support for themselves and to support others with their recovery. Thats why we allow content that discusses eating disorders for the purpose of recovery.Eating disorder charity Beat’s Head of Communications Rebecca Willgress says: Online s and ‘leader boards’ that encourage people to compete to entrench their illness are very harmful, especially as many people with eating disorders have low self-esteem and become dependent on losing weight to feel achievement.Eating disorders are extremely complex mental illnesses that develop as a result of many risk factors, and social media is never the sole and direct cause of someone developing an eating disorder.However we strongly encourage social media s to do more to ensure such content cannot be posted, in the same way as they are now cracking down on images of self-harm.“It is important to note that most pro-ana and pro-mia content is posted by people who are themselves suffering from an eating disorder and is not deliberately malicious. People may use forums that encourage disordered eating because they feel they can talk to people with similar experiences and be understood. Yet there are positive social media accounts and online forums that people can turn to instead and social media s should do more to direct affected users to such sources of support.”While social media sites insist they do everything they can to protect young teens from harm, with easily accessible posts encouraging unhealthy fasting, its clear theres still along way to go.If youre affected or need advice, please visit Beats website, or call their helpline number   . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working. Legal aid is meant to ensure the right to a fair trial, not help killers avoid being held to account.LEEDS United boss Marcelo Bielsa has restored faith in modern football.His players were wrong to score against Aston Villa while their opponents had a man down injured, but he immediately put it right by gting Villa an equaliser.You could see on Bielsa’s face how much it hurt. The gesture was the final nail in the coffin for Leeds’ automatic promotion challenge — and an incredible example for footie-mad kids who need to know the importance of fair play.In an era where sport stars hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it’s heart-warming to see a team go about things the right way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has requested a battery of tests, such as blood and toxicology analysis.In the meantime Sao Paulo police have registered the death as: Suspicious with the reason to be claried.His sister Alexandra told G Globo that she was unsure of the cause of death, but denounced the lies being spread about him.She said: I want to clary these untruths that are people are saying about him.He did Crossfit, yoga, meditated, did not use drugs, had a super-healthy diet. Its hard to understand. Only when we have the report in hand to know what really happened.There are several speculations. They are saying ious untruths, such asanorexia, drugs, veganism, stress or even because they did not offer vegan snack before the parade - some absurd things.At the same time, Tales mum Heloisa posted on social media a statement saying he was not hungry or suffering anorexia.The -year-old wrote: I would like to make it clear here mainly following some media stories that Tales Cotta was not without food, because as a mother I always worried about his health and so did he.A few minutes before the parade, I asked himhe had eaten and he told me that he had eaten a lot and they had everything backstage.I was also informed that he did not suffer from epilepsy and that epilepsy did not kill him.He always had great health and always had regular health examinations. Fatalities happen and it was his time. We are all here in passing. I just do not want the media to start making up stories to sell fake information.I appreciate everyones affection. My son was a ‘golden’ boy. He had no vices. Im really going to miss him.Many initially thought his fall was part of the performance but the devastating realisation dawned on the crowd when paramedics rushed to the stage.He was whisked to Accident and Emergency in Brazil but sadly couldnt be saved and was later pronounced dead, show organisers said.Footage showed him turning around as he approached the top of the catwalk before he appeared to stagger and fall face-first to the ground.According to Folha Press, Tales reportedly tripped on his shoelace before he fell and was later seen foaming at the mouth.Initially, there were suspicions he had suffered an epileptic fit due to the way he fell and the appearance of foam at the mouth.The model’s agent, Rogério Cami, from MGT Base agency said to FocusOn News: “This has been a shocking series of events that we’re trying hard to piece together. But everything happened so suddenly and unexpectedly.“Doctors suspect that Tales might have had a congenital problem. From videos, they believe he died on the catwalk.“It was all so fast: he kissed a friend behind the scenes who was following him, walked out confidently as usual, then suddenly stumbled, lost his footing and fell.”Gabrielle Gomes, Tales sister, said to Brazilian media, G she was unaware of any health problems.Her brother had regular health check-ups and had no history of epileptic fits or fainting spells.She said: “Me and my mother spoke to Tales by video call before the parade and he said he was well and said he had just finished eating a carrot.“We’re very scared and devastated by what happened. He was very healthy, ate healthily and exercised every day. He did cross fit and yoga.”His family, who live in Manhuaçu, in Minas Gerais state, some  miles from Sao Paulo, were watching the live broadcast of the parade, when they noticed that Tales hadn’t ed to the catwalk.Shortly afterwards the transmission was cut off.A still traumatised Gabrielle said: My mother called to find out what was going on, they said that Tales had been taken ill and hospitalised and shortly after, the organisation called again and said he had died.”The organisers wrote on Instagram: May God welcome you with open arms! Le is definitely a catwalk, were just passing through!

She lied to everyone . She was almost really convincing.I cant really even put it into words. I hurt for my child, and I was just angry that someone could do that.Smith was put on leave pending the end of an investigation and was officially sacked on March .In a statement, the school said: The Shawnee Mission School District was deeply distressed by the actions shown in the video.We take our responsibility to keep our children safe extremely seriously, and as parents and educators, we are heartbroken whenever a child is not treated with love and respect.

He told the conference: “We are at a defining moment, where the case for independence has never been stronger and we are also winning the economic argument.“The plan is a crystal-clear economic case to take the nation. It’s a plan that reassures, inspires and offers optimism in and for Scotland.”In yesterday’s heated two-hour debate, Mr Kerevan claimed an indy Scotland wouldn’t be able to borrow and invest on the scale required to be economically successful until it controlled currency.Academic Dr Tim Rideout also warned Scotland would have “no lender of last resort” until it had a new central bank and currency.He added: “We would not have real independence, we would have risk.

They tell researchers like me that Brexit has been terribly managed, their vote has been betrayed, politicians have let them down and politics is broken.They ask: Why is Britain still in the EU and why is nobody listening While lots of council seats are up for grabs in Labour’s northern metropolitan boroughs, which will give us a taste of what voters think about Mr Corbyn’s drt towards a soft Brexit, voters will also head to the polls in traditional “true blue” and often pro-Brexit Conservative territory.Such is the anger over Brexit and the dismay at the state of Mrs May’s leadership that many Conservative activists are refusing to campaign, while I suspect thousands of Conservatives won’t even bother to vote.While the latest forecasts suggest that the Conservatives could lose between  and , seats, I’ll be looking closely at what’s happening on the ground in pro-Brexit Conservative councils such as Medway in Kent, North Lincolnshire, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.If you see Mrs May’s vote collapsing in these kinds of areas then it’s a good sign that the Conservatives are about to face an almighty second punch at an election that will shortly follow.Read moreCertainly not the Conservatives at the way things are going.Although pollsters don’t ask how people will be voting at local polls, the Tories’ ratingsthere were another general election have dropped by around ten percentage points in the last month alone.Labour has picked up a small part of the votes alongside smaller parties Change UK and Ukip.ChangeUK isn’t standing candidates on Thursday but you can expect pro-Brexit party Ukip to hoover up some votes from frustrated Tories.However, Ukip has pushed to the right in recent months and could put more moderate Brexiteers off giving them their vote.The Tories been being squeezed in the polls by the Brexit Party, but they aren’t standing in the locals, and are focusing on the EU poll next month instead.Many Brits might not turn out to vote at all out of total frustration over the whole thing.Or they could back completely independent candidates in the hope of something completely dferent with a fresh start.One MP told The Sun: Turnout will be low - but who will stay at home the most The danger for us is that as the Government we take most of the responsibility and Labours core vote is a bit more tribal.Another predicted that the locals would be a poor result for everyone and wouldnt change much at all.A Tory wipeout will lead to more calls for the PM to quit and let someone  take over.Any poor result will weaken Mrs May and could collapse even more support for her beleaguered deal.If she did quit, its likely a more hardline Tory would take her place like Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab, and that could have a huge effect on the way Brexit goes next.They want to re-open the deal, or go for a No Deal Brexitthey cant get their demands met.But the PMs currently vowing to carry on trying to push her deal through no matter how the results come out, so theres a strong chance these polls wont change much at all.Sunderland: This is always one area to look at on election night as it tends to give us a good picture of what might happen across the country.But local elections don’t always show the same results as general elections.Scarborough: just one seat is needed to gain the council from the Tories. If they managed to pull it off, it might be a small win in what could be a tough night for them.Broxtowe: Ex-Tory MP Anna Soubry defected to ChangeUK earlier this year -voters want to punish her they could use the locals to do it.Maidenhead: Will Theresa May face a mutiny in her own backyard Calderdale, Trafford, Milton Keynes and Dudley are areas Labour are hoping to make gains to give them control, or push them out of a minority administration.Cheshire West and Chester has a majority of just one - could the Tories do well and pinch it back off them How would you vote in an EU election Brexit Party  per cent, Labour  per cent, Conservatives  per cent, Lib Dems seven per cent, ChangeUK seven per cent, Green six per cent, Ukip three per cent.Remain or Leave the EU   per cent Remain,  per cent Leave How are the Government handling the Brexit negotiations   per cent disapprove Who would make the best Prime Minister  May  per cent, Corbyn  per cent. Northern Ireland: Will the DUP maintain a strong position there as they continue to fight for the union and oppose Mrs May’s Brexit deal Any signs that they are losing support could worry the Tories who are in coalition with the  DUP MPs after ’s general election.Winchester: The Liberal Democrats only need one seat to gain control of the council here.Don’t watch: uncontested seats.For  seats we’ll know the results of before the polls even open, most of them are in the East Midlands."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT0004862634141-e1556552960","title":"uber eats cyclist blackmailed couple photos dying baby","story":"They claim a woman eventually came forward to say that she had the phone.But instead of ing it, its alleged she tried to blackmail the grieving couple for , , reports news.au.According Jay, the person who contacted them allegedly demanded the money be “deposited into their account for theof the phone”.Police have charged Siti Nurhidayah, , with one count of blackmail for allegedly demanding cash from the desperate parents.The Springvale woman faced Ringwood Magistrates’ Court today and was denied bail.She had been living in Australia for four months, working as an Uber Eats delivery cyclist.

Labour is split at the highest levels over whether to demand a “confirmatory vote” on any deal to leave the European Union.  Supporters of a second referendum claim the party leadership will be convinced to keep the option on the table during the talks.  But they are likely to be disappointed over Mr Corbyn’s refusal to allow a fresh vote on any Brexit deal.  Labour has said only that it would take the decision back to the people to avoid a damaging Tory Brexit or No Deal.      A string of shadow ministers and many Labour backbenchers want a fresh public vote to be a key demand of cross-party Brexit talks. They doubt Mrs Corbyn’s commitment to the issue after Labour released a European election leaflet last week that initially ignored it. Pro-EU Labour supporters have sent more than , e-mails to the NEC urging them to include a confirmatory vote in their draft. Key unions Unison, GMB and Usdaw - who all have NEC reps - are also strongly demanding the party adopt the policy.  Last night, senior Labour sources confirmed the leadership was prepared to sign up to a referendum but not on “any” deal. It raises the prospect of the party helping to deliver a Labour-led Brexit - but without demanding a public vote in .  Labour resumed cross-party Brexit talks with ministers yesterday that are designed to break the Brexit stalemate.    The Mirror understands that the negotiations - which had appeared deadlocked - went better than before. Insiders suggested the Government side, which had previously refused to budge on the PM’s red lines, was more open to movement. Senior sources played down the prospect of an imminent breakthrough but remarked on a “noticeable improvement” in tone.  But the Labour MPs behind the drive for a fresh vote have written to the NEC urging the party to use the elections to campaign for a fresh poll regardless of whether a deal has been reached with the Government.  In a letter to the NEC, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson wrote: “If a deal is implemented without first going to the people for confirmation, then in the months and years ahead, the public will have a right to say ‘this isn’t the Brexit I voted for’.” Labour MPs in Leave-voting seats suggested a public vote ony deal would be electoral suicide in parts of the North and the Midlands.  Gloria del Piero, MP for Ashfield, said: “Labour must stop its sleight-of-hand on a second Brexit referendum or risk alienating working people.”  Grimbsby MP Melanie Onn said a new vote was designed to reverse Brexit. “It will send a message of a tin-eared Labour Party, unconcerned by the views of the heartlands it needs to hang on to in order to form a Government,” she said.

Each time someone is found fit for work, the DWP sends their GP a standard letter informing them of the decision.But the wording of this letter changed in  to say GPs do not need to provide any more fit notes to their patient - even though these are needed to keep claiming benefits during an appeal.Campaigners say these new letters leave some claimants stranded without cash, and the Royal College of GPs warned they are potentially endangering [patientsapos] health.”    The DWP said it recognises GPsapos concerns, has issued interim guidance and is drawing up a revised letter to be used from this summer. But Mirror analysis of official figures shows huge numbers of aposfit for workapos letters have already been sent since the new wording launched in August . Government statistics show people were found aposfit for workapos , times from September  to September . The real total is likely to be higher, as figures for the last six months are not yet available. The DWP has not confirmed the number of letters it sent, but said a letter is generated automatically each time someone is found fit for work. That suggests all , fit-for-work decisions in that period led to a letter to a GP. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the Mirror: “It has become clear that the wording on the current ESAB letter has had unforeseen consequences - and as this analysis shows, could potentially have affected a signicant number of people.  She added: “Patients appealing a decision require a fit note to be able to continue to receive benefits. Without this document, their finances - and ultimately their health - are potentially at risk. No GP wants that, and it only serves to threaten the long-standing trust that patients have in their family doctor. “As doctors, our concern is the health and wellbeing of our patients. We are not benefits assessors and must never be used as barriers for patients to receive benefits when they are entitled to them, as ultimately, this can have a detrimental impact on their health.” Shadow Minister for Disabled People Marsha De Cordova said: These figures reveal the shocking scale of the problem caused by these letters.  It is outrageous that the misleading information sent to GPs in these letters will have wrongly deprived sick and disabled people of social security they should have been entitled to. The Government must immediately act to scrap the letters and prevent any further harm. Raji Hunjan, chief executive of welfare advice charity the Zacchaeus  Trust, said: It is incredibly worrying that potentially thousands of claimants are being denied their disability benefits because the DWP are sending these damaging letters to the claimantsapos GPs. These letters are pushing people into poverty. The DWP have the power to put an end to this and we urge them do so with immediate effect. Commons Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field said: Though nearly three quarters of ESA decisions are being overturned by appeals, the DWP still manages to make this disastrous situation worse by sending out hundreds of thousands of the letters that GPs say are putting patients’ health at risk.  Rather than confusing and dissuading GPs from giving patients the fit notes they need to keep them going while these masses of appeals grind on, perhaps DWP should focus on getting it right in the first place We drew our figure from DWP statistics on the outcomes of ESA fit-for-work tests by month, and a Freedom of Information reply which dated the change to August .The numbers peaked in January , when , decisions were made to find claimants aposfit for workapos. The lowest number was in September  when , people were found fit for work. DWP sources accepted some GPs found the revised letter confusing and have issued interim guidance. But they stressed only a minority of claimants would be hit by the issue, because the majority do not launch appeals.  And they said standing guidance has always been to keep issuing fit notessomeone is appealing a benefit cut. A DWP spokesperson said: We want to ensure that people with health conditions and disabilities get the support they’re entitled to.aposIn the minority of cases where a claimant is found not to qualy for ESA we will advise them on the appeal process.“A small minority of claimants do choose to appeal and while our standing guidance has always been clear, we have issued an update to GPs to ensure these claimants get the support they need. Where most claimants do not appeal, we will support them to claim other out-of-work benefits.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour say ordinary people better","story":"NewsLabour say ordinary people better for the economy than billionaires in new TV adThe party illustrates the dference between giving money to communities and to the super-rich in a new Party Election BroadcastShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video new-labour-party-election-broadcast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour illustrate why ordinary people are better for the economy than billionaires in a cheeky new TV ad.

By contrast, campaigning offences accounted for more than half of complaints. Dr Jess Garland, director of policy and research at the ERS, said: Forcing all voters to show their papers at the polling station is a solution looking for a problem. Most electoral offences are committed by parties rather than voters. Yet it is innocent voters who lose out when the Government locks ordinary people out of democracy - and millions risk being excluded from our politics because of these plans. Cat Smith MP, Labouraposs shadow minister for voter engagement, said: At a time when millions of people are missing from the electoral roll, it takes a special kind of ignorance for the Government to be trying to make it harder for people to vote.

Brits were given an extra day off to mark the unforgettable occasion, and those who didnapost travel to London held street parties and gathered around the TV to watch the historical moment. While most of us remember the main parts of the day, some of the smaller sweet moments may have been forgotten - so weaposve taken a look back at some of the highlights.    Kate and Williamaposs hilarious ­version of You’re The One That I Want The couple treated their guests to a performance of You’re The One That I Want from Grease during the evening celebrations. They strutted and sang their way through the John Travolta and ­Olivia Newton-John classic to the delight of guests who were clapping and cheering at the beaming newlyweds. One bleary-eyed guest – who left the party at .am – said: “The Grease number brought the house down.  “They stood holding hands in the ­middle of the dancefloor grinning, then suddenly the opening bars of the song came booming out. “The reaction was just brilliant. Everyone started clapping to the music. “Wills and Kate began dancing around, pointing at each other and mouthing the words. It was ­hilarious. “When the song finished, they ended up in each other’s arms with massive smiles on their faces. “Everyone was cheering wildly, whooping and they did a bow to each other. “After that, the ­dancefloor filled up and the party got going properly. It was a fabulous night. The kind of night you ­never forget.” Kateaposs second wedding dressThe Duchess of Cambridgeaposs stunning Alexander McQueen dress was photographed thousands of times from every angle when she married Prince William in .It inspired a whole generation of brides and immediately brought lace long sleeves back into fashion. But Kate changed out of the stunning gown and into a second dress for the evening celebrations.  Kate opened for another beautul Sarah Burton creation - a white satin dress with a diamante waistband. Kate finished off the look with an angora bolero cardigan and had a whole new hairstyle for the evening - as you do... And she wasnapost the only member of the royal family who changed ready to party the night away.Prince William changed out of his dress unorm and into a tux while Pippa Middleton ditched her bottom-hugging gown for a glamorous green number.Prince Harryaposs best man speechAccording to many of the guests one of the highlights of the glamorous event was  Prince Harry aposs Best Man speech.A guest revealed: “Harry only said a few words, but it was so emotional. The entire room burst into applause.”Wearing a fez hat Harry had started his speech by standing on the top table and describing the newlyweds as the “Dude and Duchess”.   As guests chuckled, he poked fun at William’s ­receding hairline and said he felt sorry for Kate marrying a “bald man”. And there was barely a dry eye as Harry turned to William and told him: “Our mother would be so very proud of you.” And how he made his new sister-in-law cry... According to royal author Katie Nicholl his speech also contained some emotional moments. She said: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. The speech was peppered with Harryaposs classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: aposWilliam didnapost have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kateapos.  Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate aposBabykinsapos, to much laughter from the guests. When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear.

William and Kate took to the floor arm in arm for their slow waltz at .pm, cheered by the  guests at the evening reception.  Ellie Goulding performed her version of Elton Johnaposs Your Song, but Wills reportedly asked her to switch to a faster number. The dance only lasted  seconds. The table names Instead of using boring old numbers, Kate and Wills decided to use names of places that were special to them for their tables.    These included Lewa after Lewa Downs, where the groom spent time on his gap year, Tetbury, a town near Charlesaposs county home Highgrove and villages near their Anglesey home. There was also, of course, a St Andrews table - the university where the couple met. An unhappy bridesmaid Being a bridesmaid can always be a lot to take on, especially for little kids. So itaposs hardly surprising that one of Kateaposs little helpers seemed to have had enough when it came to waving to well-wishers on the Buckingham Palace balcony. With thousands of people lining the streets to catch a glimpse of the couple, it would have been very noisy up there - too noisy for Williamaposs goddaughter Grace van Cutsem.  As the couple enjoyed their famous balcony kiss, adorable little Grace could be seen covering her ears with her hands with a big scowl on her face. Due to her positioning on the balcony, Graceaposs unhappy face appears in pretty much all of their kiss photos. Oops! Prince Charlesaposs sweet comments about Kate The father of the groom used his speech to praise his new daughter-in-law, calling her Williamaposs soul mate.A friend told the: William spoke very well but it was Charles who really gave high praise to his daughter-in-law.He [Prince Charles] said they were really lucky to have a daughter like her. The speech really brought a tear to the eye. She was a delightful child and is now a delightful young woman.    Another said Charles went on to make a few jokes: “The Prince of Wales made jokes about his bald patch and his son’s bald patch, saying it must be hereditary. He was stood slightly up on a stand so he was looking down on William to his left. William smiled, he was amused. Kate looked amused as well.” The second wedding cake - a special request from WillsAs well as their stunning aposofficialapos wedding cake, the couple also had a more personal second one - as itaposs one of Williamaposs favourites .The chocolate biscuit cake was made by Paul Courtney, from McVitieaposs, which was described as rich, indulgent and creamy with a really snappy texture which came from the Rich Tea biscuits. Prince Harry popped in to see Paul when he was putting the finishing touches to the cake - and it almost ended in disaster. Speaking on an ITV documentaty Invitation to a Royal Wedding, he said: Weaposd literally just put the top on and of course at that point itaposs like – oh – collective sigh of relief, I think there was a tear in my eye - we’ve done it, it looks fantastic.  And I remember Harry came bounding in and he walked up to it and very enthusiastic. Harry was how you’d expect him to be, just a fun joker. And he walked up to it, very enthusiastic, aposOh, wow fantastic, is this chocolate apos And he picked up a piece of chocolate up and ate it and then he pretended to box, with the top decoration, and we were like – aposOh noapos– … it was fun but a slightly heart stopping moment. The after-party Harry was one of the last to leave and led a group of guests back to the Goring Hotel for an after party.  A car driven by royal protection officers dropped off Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie with Harry’s on-off girlfriend Chelsy Davy. It was not until around am that the last bleary-eyed revellers eventually called it a night. Emerging from The Goring yesterday, Middleton family friend Tony Ainsworth, said: “I went to bed around am but I heard guests stumbling around at am, coming back from the palace, which woke me up.” "},{"url":null,"title":"asda tesco making urgent product","story":"NewsAsda and Tesco issue urgent product recalls over SALMONELLA fearsAsda and Tesco have issued rare, urgent product recalls after a salmonella scare and are asking anyone who has shopped with them recently to check their cupboardsShareCommentsByTristan Grove:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video supermarket-product-recalls-explained-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTesco and Asda have issued urgent product recalls over salmonella fears.

The World Health Organisation made the finding after surveying the parents of , children, aged six to nine, in the biggest study of its kind. The results, unveiled at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow, revealed for the first time how breast milk keeps kids at a healthy weight. Author Dr Joao Breda, of the WHO, said: “We need to see more measures to encourage breast-feeding, like properly paid maternity leave. “We need less inappropriate marketing of formula milk, which may lead mothers to believe it is as good for babies as breast milk.” Children who were never breast fed were % more likely to be obese than those fed both breast milk and formula for at least six months.    Sue Ashmore, of Unicef UK, said: “Human milk is specically designed for human babies. “Not only does it act as baby’s first vaccine, protecting against infections, but it also affects long-term health, including acting as the first defence against the epidemic of obesity.” Previous research shows % of UK babies start off breast fed but only % are getting any breast milk at all at six weeks old.Just % of UK babies are fed only breast milk for six months, compared to a European average of around %.

Researchers revealed long queues, loud roadworks and train delays are also among some of the most irritating things in modern le which get our blood boiling. A third of Brits can’t stand when motorists don’t use their indicators when making a turn, and  per cent have felt their temper flare when hearing someone talking about them behind their back. As a result of these annoying moments, the average Brit will feel angry or frustrated five times a week. And with each spell of anger lasting an average of  minutes, this means the typical Brit will spend an hour and  minutes each week surrounded by the red mist. Though one in eight claim they never get angry or frustrated. A spokesperson for Andrews Sykes, which commissioned the study, said: “Even with the best intentions in the world we are likely to spend hours or days of our lives feeling angry, frustrated and generally ‘hot under the collar’.    “Le is unpredictable, and many of these unfortunate circumstances which lead us to anger or embarrassment are caused by others, who might not realise they’re doing anything wrong at all.” The study also found strangers are most likely to be the cause of the nation’s frustrations, followed by annoying partners and irritating kids. And  per cent of Brits think they are more likely to lose their rag with someone after a bad day at work. A third of Brits admit they are often quick to anger, and  per cent have found themselves having to stop to take a breath, count to  and calm down when their rage becomes too much. Forty one per cent have been so hot under the collar in a confrontation with someone they have had to walk away in silence to themselves. It also emerged one in four find it best to calm their fires with a cup of tea, and  per cent shut their eyes and go to ‘a happy place’. But as well as anger causing their face to turn red, the average Brit will also turn scarlet due to embarrassment twice a week, or  times a year.  Brits reckon their partner is most likely to make them feel embarrassed, followed by their kids. And of the parents surveyed, two thirds believe they have become more prone to embarrassment since having their children. Fty-six per cent of the , Brits polled literally blush – going pink in the face – when they are feeling embarrassed. And  per cent of these blushers feel only more embarrassed when someone points out their flushed cheeks.  A spokesperson for Andrews Sykes added: “Whether hot under the collar or red in the face, it has been interesting exploring the aspects of Brits’ lives most likely to make us act irrationally. “It is also good to discover the one in eight Brits who are able to keep a cool head even in the most frustrating circumstances, and the three in five who take embarrassing situations in good humour.”To read the full results of the study, visit:  www.andrews-sykes blog poor-road-etiquette-and-losing-money-among-the-average-britons-biggest-gripes-study-finds TOP  THINGS WHICH GET BRITS ‘HOT UNDER THE COLLAR’Drivers who donapost use their indicators Queuing for a long time Losing your wallet Cyclists who don’t obey the Highway Code such as skipping red traffic lights Being sat in traffic Falling over tripping in public When you break something in a moment of stupidity Having to ask people for money they owe you Roadworks Train delays Finding out someone has been talking about you Coming out of a toilet someone  has made a terrible stench in, then finding someone waiting outside who will think it was you Bumping your nice car Waiting for other people to make a decision Someone bailing on plans you’ve had for ages Waiting for someone to get ready When you are trying to follow a sat nav which keeps taking you the wrong way Finding out your friends met up and you werenapost invited Bank fees Building flat pack furniture Watching a sex scene in a film with your parents Seeing a photograph where you donapost look your best Being the first person to arrive somewhere and having to sit alone for ages Hearing other parents swear in front of your children Calling someone by the wrong name and finding out afterwards that you made the mistake.

We walked away with about £, and we had paid all the £,. A spokeswoman for Trecco Bay Holiday Park said: A holiday home owner at our park has a number of options when they decide to bring their ownership to an end.    An owner may sell their holiday home privately on the holiday park and we will support them through this. Alternatively an owner may remove their holiday home from the park and relocate it at their choice. In some circumstances an owner has the option to sell their holiday home back to the holiday park. If they take up this option the holiday home is valued by the park, and the owner is under no obligation to sell the holiday home at that price. The selling price of a holiday home includes a number of annual charges such as pitch fees, general and water rates, and siting and connection costs, along with safety testing and general operating costs. The holiday home added thata holiday home is sold privately and removed from the park then no commission is payable. If an owner sells their holiday home to a third party on the park the buyer is required to pay a commission.

There is a  per cent chance that the -year-old mum-of-one will die on the operating table.Michelle, who suffers from Crohnaposs disease, needs five new organs - all from the same donor - to replace most of the lower half of her abdomen after she woke up to find her insides bursting out and leaking blood and faeces.   The mum, from Ilkeston, Derbys, has been left with multiple organ failure due to a fistula - an abnormal opening between organs or other structures in the body. The hole formed ten years after she gave birth to her daughter via Caesarean section. Michelle said: At the end of the day itaposs only a matter of time before I could pass away, it just gets worse. In , I woke up one morning and my stomach had burst open, it was leaking blood and faeces.  The insides of my stomach were just falling out, there was blood all over me. My quality of le is so bad that Iaposm willing to gamble - half of my insides are being replaced. I want this gaping hole in my stomach to go, I canapost do anything, it has completely taken over my le. The little things have become so dficult, I just want to enjoy a meal, or go out and not have to worry about my stomach opening up and spilling out. Even going for something as normal as a picnic is hard - everyone is sitting around eating lovely food and I canapost touch it, I always have to be on guard.  The hole that burst and was leaking blood and bodily fluids was diagnosed as a fistula. Michelle said: Itaposs hard to explain, but because I have had so many operations on my bowels, they stopped working so everything just clogs up in my body, and it has to leave somewhere. In , whilst still having a hole in her stomach that is re-dressed daily by a nurse, Michelle started to dramatically lose weight and gradually dropped to just four stone in weight. Michelle said: They told me my organs had packed up and I only had a few days of le left. Luckily Michelle went to the hospital just in time, and was given a TPN, or liquid feed, that was set up at her home after spending four weeks in hospital. Crohnaposs disease causes inflammation of the digestive systemaposs lining - from the mouth to the back passage - and is a long-term condition. The exact cause of the disease is not known, but factors can include genetics, immune system problems, previous infections, smoking and environmental factors. There is no cure. Common symptoms can include:Diarrhoea Abdominal pain Fatigue Unintended weight loss Blood and mucus in faecesSteroid medication is usually the first treatment, but surgery to remove the inflamed section of intestine may be requiredmedications arenapost successful. People with Crohnaposs disease sometimes go for long periods without symptoms or with very mild symptoms, the NHS says. About , people in the UK currently have the condition.   Six nights a week, a nurse visits Michelleaposs home to administer the liquid feed, which sends vital nutrients direct to her major arteries. Michelle said: My weight started to get better but I still have a nurse coming to my house to feed me every day, itaposs just insane, I canapost keep living like this. My organs have stopped working, I still have a hole in my stomach and a permanent colostomy bag. I had one of the worst days of my le in , I felt ill so I had to go to hospital and after being there for a couple of hours, my we, Laura, walked in and found me unresponsive and staring into space. The next thing I remember was the room filling up with doctors, I had gone into septic shock due to infections caused by the TPN and my veins giving in after being pumped with liquid nutrients for the last four years.Related video: Once they stabilised me, they told Laura to come in so we could say our goodbyes because I would not make it to the next day. Saying goodbye to my daughter, and Laura, was one of the hardest moments I have ever faced. Somehow, two hours later I made a full recovery and I decided to marry Laura six weeks later. Now, with consultants seeing that her articial feed is failing due to infections destroying her veins, and running out of options, they have put her forward to have five of her organs replaced in an incredibly rare  hour surgery that will replace her liver, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine and half of her stomach - which will hopefully give her back a quality of le she has lost. Michelle said: The idea that I have a  per cent chance of never waking up is terrying. What I always remember is that thereaposs also a  per cent chance that Iaposll wake up better, Iaposll be able to take my daughter on holiday and weaposll be able to swim together. I want my quality of le back. I want to enjoy days out with my family just like everyone . Without my we and daughter, who have been amazing throughout this whole process I would have already given up. Iaposm risking this for them, for better or for worse. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust consultant transplant surgeon Andrew Butler said: This procedure, which includes an intestine graft, is rare and certainly complex. We have carried out about  such procedures and internationally there have been around , bowel containing transplants in adults since .

Natalie Price, from Cardf, Wales, was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as ME, after suffering from a kidney infection. She has not gone downstairs since ing from a doctoraposs appointment in June , according to her fiancé Jonathan Vaughan.Natalie is so easily exhausted that she is no longer able to have long conversations, read a book or even watch television, reports Wales Online.Jonathan, who is now Natalie’s carer, said: “The hardest part of it all is the fact I can only spend around  minutes with her every day. “Any longer than that and she’s overstimulated. “She can only see her friends for about  minutes once a month. They will come up to her darkened bedroom and speak to her, but often she can’t reply very much. “I’ve basically had to stand by and watch her go from a very active, determined person into someone who can’t even eat a bowl of soup because it requires too much energy in her arms.”   Cardf council worker Jonathan, from the cityaposs Grangetown district, said he met Natalie six years ago online and their relationship quickly blossomed.“Natalie would always love to go out running, would always have a job even when studying, and generally hated doing anything sedentary,” he added. But after Natalie was struck down with a kidney infection he noticed her energy levels drop signicantly, resulting in her giving up a part-time job in sandwich chain Subway. “About an hour into one of her shts, her body would just shut down from pure exhaustion and I’d have to go there and take her home,” he said. “Then she had to drop out of university, leaving her dream degree in dietetics as she was physically unable to go to the classes.” Before long Natalie had to give up some of her most treasured hobbies including painting and playing computer games.    “In June  she had a doctor’s appointment and went up to bed following that. She hasn’t been downstairs since,” Jonathan, , added. “Her bedroom window has had to be blacked out as her sensitivity to light is too high, she has to have earplugs or some form of ear protection in at all times. “She is barely able to have visitors at all as the interaction – evenit’s just two people talking in her room – is far too overstimulating and causes her symptoms to worsen. “She is extremely sensitive to smells so any hint of aftershave or cleaning products severely affects her and makes her feel much worse. “She is unable to leave her room so to wash I need to give her a sponge bath in bed.” After several years being unable to pinpoint what was wrong with her, doctors diagnosed Natalie, , with myalgic encephalomyelitis. The neurological condition affects the body and brain’s inability to recover after expending even small amounts of energy. Jonathan admits he has seen his beloved fiancée’s character slowly slip away without any real support from the NHS in Wales. “The only things offered by the doctor were antidepressants, which made Natalie’s ME worse, and a referral to a rheumatology department who told me they were unable to do a home visit and weren’t even able to hold a phone consultation. “The lack of understanding for Natalie’s condition was stark and worrying.” Jonathan said the current NICE guidelines for treating ME, which recommend cognitive behavioural therapyand graded exercise therapy , are “archaic” and can actually make sufferers worse.    “ME patients like Natalie are still being widely ignored due to the NICE guidelines not offering effective therapy, he said. “A Parliamentary debate was held after concerns were raised by Carol Monaghan MP, backed by Ben Lake of Plaid Cymru. The main aim of this was to remove CBT and GET as treatments from the NICE guidelines as they cause harm. “Nothing has been done yet. There is a NICE review, however this wont be done until October . That’s just far too late and thousands will suffer because of this.” At present Natalie is able to get vitamin B injections - which Jonathan buys and carries out himself - but very little . He added: “Clonazepam has been shown to help ME sufferers with their cognitive ability, but because there are addiction worries this is not prescribed – despite it being something known to help. “Unless a drug is described in the NICE guidelines as being helpful to ME, it does not get prescribed, so yet again the issue comes back to those guidelines.” After speaking to an ME specialist in England, Jonathan has now set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to get Natalie brain photobiomodulationtherapy privately. It works by feeding red light directly to the brain which then boosts the neurons’ ability to create energy. “Natalie is at the moment akin to a plant in a dark room that is unable to photosynthesize as her cells cannot generate energy,” said Jonathan. “A treatment like bPBM for Natalie could be like moving that plant outside into the sunshine. “These are treatments that have shown promise in trials. Although bPBM is used more for dementia at the moment, trials regarding ME have shown to increase cognitive ability. “To even get Natalie back to a place where she can watch an episode of something on TV once a day would be miraculous for us. “Frankly, she has absolutely no quality of le at the moment and we will do anything to try and claw at least some of it back for her. Her entire le has just stopped.” In response, the Welsh Government says it is trying to improve services for people with ME. A spokeswoman said: “We understand the challenges faced by people living with this condition and the impact it can have on their lives and their families. That is why we are working with healthcare professionals and the third sector to strengthen ME services available across Wales.”If you would like to donate to Natalie go to - www.gofundme lets-give-natalie-some-of-her-le-back"},{"url":null,"title":"young drivers botched attempt tricking","story":"NewsYoung drivers botched attempt at tricking parking wardens costs her £Malikah Richards, who is a legal worker, used Tipp-Ex on a ticket for her Mercedes in a desperate bid to save £ShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  APR NewsMalikah Richards admitted two counts of fraud \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A legal worker who tried to fool parking wardens and save £ by using Tipp-Ex on a ticket has now been ordered to pay £.Malikah Richards, , paid just £. for an houraposs parking but tried to trick attendants by whiting out the  and writing  to make it look like she paid the day rate.

The government is keen residentsas soon as it is safe, and this month around % of the town of Okuma, which sits just west of the plant, was declared safe for habitation thanks to ongoing decontamination efforts carried out on an superhuman scale. The official mandatory evacuation order was lted, and while reports reveal just  residents of Okumaaposs original population of , have so far made the decision to , and most of the town remains off-limits, the Japanese government is keen this be seen as a positive start to re-building this devastated area. This is a major milestone for the town, Toshitsuna Watanabe, mayor of Okuma, told Japanese news outlets, as six pensioners locally dubbed aposThe Old Man Squadapos, who had taken it upon themselves to defy advice and keep their town secure, finally ceased their patrols. It has taken many years to get to where we are now, but I am happy that we made it.   The Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, visited to mark the milestone. The government is particularly keen to show progress before the  Olympic Games in Tokyo. Six Olympic softball games and a baseball game will be staged in Fukushima, the capital of this prefecture, which is free of radiation. The torch relay will even begin at J Village, which was once the base for the crisis response team. Hearteningly, it is now back to its original , a football training centre.  But the truth is, it is mainly older residents who have decided toto their homes. Seimei Sasaki, , explained his family have roots here stretching back  years. His neighbourhood in Odaka district now only contains  of its original . “I can’t imagine what this village’s future looks like,” he admitted.  Young families are few and far between – these areas are still a terrying prospect for parents. But the re-built schools are slowly filling a handful of classroom seats. Namie Sosei primary and middle school, less then three miles from the plant, has seven pupils. One teacher said: “The most frustrating thing for them is that they can’t play team sports.” A sad irony as the Olympics approach.  And with so many residents still fearful, so the deadly clean-up operation continues. Work to make the rest of Okuma safe is predicted to take until . The area which was its centre is still a no-go zone. In the years following the disaster, , workers removed topsoil, tree branches, grass and other contaminated material from areas near homes, schools and public buildings. A staggering £billion has been spent in order to make homes safe. Millions of cubic metres of radioactive soil has been packed into bags. By  it is predicted million cubic metres will have been generated.  The mass scale operation uses thousands of workers. Drivers are making ,trips a day. But residents understandably want it moved out of Fukushima for good. As yet, no permanent location has agreed to take it, but the government has pledged it will be gone by . At Daiichi itself, the decontamination teams are battling with the build up of m tonnes of radioactive water. The operator has also finally begun removing fuel from a cooling pool at one of three reactors that melted down in the  disaster. Decommissioning the plant entirely is expected to take at least four decades. The efforts tothis area to its former glory are mammoth, and eventhey ever fully succeed, it will surely take many more years until most former residents and their descendants gain enough trust to .

Martin Woods, captain for the day, stepped up and fired into the corner.Just one minute had passed, however, and the home side were level. David Turnbull let fly from outside the area and a massive deflection saw the ball loop over Seny Dieng and into the net.Dundee weren’t done, though, and re-took the lead through loanee Ethan Robson. The Sunderland man bashed James Dunne to the ground before curling a fine strike home from  yards.Once more, the lead didn’t last long.This time it was two minutes and this time it wasn’t bad luck that cost them, instead bad defending as James Scott was allowed to turn on the ball inside the six-yard box before his shot somehow squeezed through Dieng and into the net.Dundee almost grabbed the lead for a third time shortly after the restart as Jesse Curran saw his effort knocked on to his own post by ’Well keeper Mark Gillespie.The fth goal did come – this time it was the home side taking the lead on  minutes.It looked like Alan Campbell was about to shoot from eight yards only for Nathan Ralph to get a vital toe in. The ball, though, dropped for Ariyibi who took a touch before burying it low into the corner.Leads weren’t lasting long in this one and once more it was level within seconds as Ralph rose unchallenged in the area to smash a fine header beyond Gillespie.Motherwell were then reduced to  men as Gorrin ed in on Craig Curran on halfway to earn a second yellow card with half-an-hour to play.On  minutes, the Dens men were within inches once more of going ahead for a third time as Gensy Kusunga flicked a Woods corner off the far post.With  minutes to go, Turnbull went for his second of the day from range but sent his effort just over Dieng’s crossbar. Four minutes later, Turnbull tried again but this time Dieng pulled off a super stop to keep it at -.On  minutes, Dundee hearts were in mouths as referee Kevin Clancy pointed to the spot after the ball struck Kusunga#s arm. There were dark blue sighs of relief, though, as linesman Jordan Stokoe indicated the ball had already gone behind for a goal kick.That relief wouldn#t last until the final whistle, however, as what was left of Dundee#s hopes of survival were hit once more as -man Motherwell snatched the win in stoppage time.Turnbull had been a stand-out all day and grabbed his second of the afternoon after smashing an effort off the crossbar and then burying the rebound.Dundee: Dieng, Kerr, Ralph , Kusunga, R McGowan, Woods , Robson, Wright, J Curran, C Curran, Nelson .Unused subs: Parish, O’Dea, O’Sullivan, P McGowan.Motherwell: Gillespie, Tait, Aldred, Cadden, Campbell, Ariyibi , Grimshaw , Dunne, Gorrin, Turnbull, Scott .Unused subs: Ferguson, Hartley, Frear, Johnson."},{"url":null,"title":"emirates-a380-inside-luxurious-double-decker-jet-as-it-comes-to-glasgow","story":"THIS is an inside look at Emiratesrsquo huge and luxurious ldquosuperjumbo jet that will be landing in Glasgowtoday."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"orchardton-castle-owner-susan-devere-rapped-by-watchdog-over-raffle","story":"THE owner of a Scottish castle has been rapped by the advertising watchdog over a raffle she launched to get rid of the property."},{"url":null,"title":"wings-over-scotlands-stuart-campbell-loses-25k-defamation-case-against-kezia-dugdale","story":"A PRO-INDEPENDENCE blogger has lost a pound, defamation case against Kezia Dugdale after she accused him of making homophbic remarks, despitea judge ruling her comments were incorrect."},{"url":null,"title":"easterhouse-boxing-sensation-dionne-polland-talks-about-taking-her-big-international-chance","story":"Teenage boxing sensation Dionne Polland says ldquoitrsquos going to be a good one when she pulls on the gloves for her international debut fight at the weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-lose-vote-on-glasgow-airport-access-project","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS SNP administration lost a vote onitsairport access project as opposition councillorsvoicedtheir frustration with council leader Susan Aitken."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-as-children-are-turned-away-from-popular-newton-mearns-school","story":"ANGRY parents in East Renfrewshire have launched a petition after being told their kids canrsquot attend the school of their choice."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-pupil-6-has-nightmares-after-school-staff-trapped-him-in-cupboard","story":"A six-year-old boy has been removed from school after allegedly being \"trapped in a cupboard\" by staff, a city councillor has claimed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-to-declare-it-is-time-for-scotland-to-become-independent","story":"Nicola Sturgeon will today declare it is ldquotime for Scotland to become independent."},{"url":null,"title":"lyons-and-daniels-inside-a-very-scottish-gang-feud","story":"There was little levity in the -week trial of the six men accused of being a hit squad for the Glasgow crime syndicate the Lyons.

Captain Graeme Shinnie was out with an ankle injury and Mikey Devlin dropped to the bench.Manchester United loanee James Wilson was drafted in to start and Lewis Ferguson ed from suspension in midfield.The home side started positively with Ryan Kent and Tavernier sending in dangerous crosses from the right in the opening  minutes, which found no takers in the centre.Aberdeen#s first offering in attack came in the th minute when Wilson#s inswinging free-kick from the right was met by Sam Cosgrove at the back post, but from six yards the header drted wide.A minute later the Dons lost Connor McLennan to injury. The -year-old appeared to tweak his hamstring in the th minute, but the winger continued # although only for three minutes.Devlin was sent on in his place which meant Max Lowe moved to the left side of midfield from left-back and Considine shted to left-back.On  minutes a period of pressure from the Gers ended with Kent sending a low left-footed shot inches wide from  yards.The Govan outfit seemed encouraged by that spell of play and were keen to keep the ball and try to work it around the Reds. Three minutes after Kent#s shot Dons keeper Joe Lewis made a fabulous save to keep the game at -.Steven Davis jabbed a ball through which was dummied by Scott Arfield for Jermain Defoe, the on-loan Bournemouth striker was in but Lewis plunged to his right and beat away the fierce shot from  yards.After that spell of defending Aberdeen responded at the other end in the th minute as Stephen Gleeson worked the ball on to Wilson on the edge of the box, the striker danced inside a couple of challenges, but his left foot strike was straight at Allan McGregor in goal.With five minutes of the first period left the Rangers pressure continued as Defoe had a shot from just inside the area deflected wide and when the resulting corner was recycled Connor Goldson headed over Kent#s delivery from the right flank.Moments later Tavernier was released on the right side of the box, but Lewis was out to narrow the angle and smother the strike. Then Davis had a shot charged down and on the rebound former Don Ryan Jack had an effort from  yards parried away by Lewis.However, Aberdeen did manage to reach half-time with the score level, but after only three minutes of the second half they were trailing.A corner wasn#t cleared and as Nikola Katic tried to turn at the back post under pressure from Ferguson the defender hit the deck following a tangle of legs.Referee Don Robertson pointed to the spot and Tavernier confidently sent Lewis the wrong way from  yards, sending the ball into the bottom right corner.Defoe passed up a gilt-edged chance to make it two shortly before the hour. The ball was worked out to Tavernier on the right, his cross deflected off Scott McKenna and hit Lewis at the near post.The rebound fell for Defoe, but the England international hooked a volley well over from four yards.On  minutes Rangers had the ball in the net after a swt counter-attack. Tavernier chipped it beyond Lewis, but was offside after taking Defoe#s through ball.After this Aberdeen had a good spell, but creating clear chances was dficult. When the Dons got further forward the final pass, or cross from a wide area, wasn#t quite there.With  minutes to the Dons# hopes of taking something from the game were over when Rangers were awarded a second penalty.Considine was adjudged to have elbowed Katic at a corner from Davis, again Robertson pointed to the spot and the whistler then produced a second yellow card for Considine- his first came near the end of the first half for a lunge on Jack # and then a red.For the second time Tavernier scored from  yards, this time putting the spot-kick into the bottom left corner to seal the points for the Gers.Rangers: Allan McGregor, James Tavernier, Connor Goldson, Nikola Katic, Jon Flanagan, Steven Davis , Ryan Jack, Glen Kamara, Scott Arfield, Jermain Defoe , Ryan Kent .Subs not used: Wes Foderingham, Joe Worrall, Andy Halliday, Glenn Middleton.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Dom Ball, Andy Considine, Scott McKenna, Max Lowe, Stephen Gleeson , Lewis Ferguson, Connor McLennan , Stevie May, James Wilson, Sam Cosgrove .Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Greg Halford, Miko Virtanen, Ethan Ross."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42588896-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42588896-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42588896-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42588896-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeens union terrace gardens revamp start in summer","story":"Work to transform Aberdeen#s Union Terrace Gardens will start this summer after a contractor was appointed.Balfour Beatty has been chosen to carry out the £. million works on the historic gardens.The plan will see the space transformed into an #inclusive st Century space# while #enhancing UTG#s heritage features#.LDA design, the firm behind London’s Olympic Park, unveiled their designs for the park in .The flagship project was originally due to be completed by July but had been knocked back until .The transformation of the park includes creating shop and cafe spaces in the arches, and installing water features and community gardens, with work expected to take between  and  months to complete.Council co-Leader Councillor Douglas Lumsden said: “With the selection of Balfour Beatty as contractor, the job of turning the vision for Union Terrace Gardens into reality is about to start in earnest.“This is a moment for celebration right across Aberdeen.“The investment we’re making is transforming our city and the benefits will be felt throughout the region. Generations to come can share in the rewards.”Hector MacAulay, Balfour Beatty’s regional managing director of Scotland and Ireland, said: “We are looking forward to working with Aberdeen City Council to transform the historic Union Terrace Gardens, which on completion will signicantly contribute to the Council’s City Centre Masterplan.“Our construction expertise coupled with our experience in regenerating public spaces makes us ideally positioned to deliver the three new pavilions and sympathetically upgrade this much-loved historic space which will benefit the local community and visitors alike for years to come.”SNP Group Leader, Councillor Stephen Flynn said: “I am sure the people of Aberdeen will be at a total loss as to how the administration can justy spending almost £ million on Union Terrace Gardens when they are continuing to make severe cuts to services across the city.“Project costs have soared by at least £ million since  and it is now certain that the gardens will be delivered two years late – what a complete shambles.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cc2fdb94c6587.05276450.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet strider tara and bond are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This handsome pup is one year old and has been neutered.Strider is a friendly boy with lots of love to give the right family.He will need a new owner who has the time to continue his training as he is strong and has not been good with other dogs while in the kennels.He is not suitable to be homed around cats or young children due to his boisterous nature.Can you offer Strider his forever home Tara is five years old and has been neutered.This lovely girl is a larger dog who will need a home with access to lots of space for her to run around in and a secure garden as she can jump quite high.She needs a home with no other pets but is used to children over  years old.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round. Good luck. Good luck.A ticket for the Millbrae breakfast,coach travel and entrance to the match is £.Other options include £ for match ticket and coach travel and £ for the match ticket only.

The cash withdrawals took place between July  and May  and Cowan helped herself to more than £, of the patient’s savings. The Scottish Social Services Councilheard how the offence came to light when the victim, known only as ‘AA’ and requiring “multiple care needs” decided to alert care home staff, believing that the money would never be repaid.When shocked senior staff at Glebe House found out about the incidents they called the police and reported the matter to the Care Inspectorate and the SSSC. But in the subsequent investigation, Cowan was understood to have shown “limited insight and remorse” in respect of her actions. The victim gave evidence during the hearing, telling the SSSC’s Fitness to Practise Panel how, during a conversation with Cowan, she told her she was “worried about money.” The victim initially offered Cowan money but that invitation was declined. However, in a later conversation, around a week later, Cowan, who had no previous record of wrong-doing with the SSSC, indicated that she “needed a certain amount of money.” On this occasion Cowan was given the lady’s bank card and PIN and the service user believed £ would be withdrawn. In the weeks and months thereafter, a similar scenario took place “several times.” Several cash withdrawals took place from the ATM at the Co-operative, Dalmellington. Cowan then came up with a “sob story” about a family member’s Christmas present and again, the patient handed over her bank card. This pattern continued and the patient did not report the matter at that point because Cowan “promised to pay it back” and she “believed her.” However, the victim’s concerns grew and she reported the matter to other members of staff after fearing she wasn’t going to get her money back. Another witness claimed she was “shocked” that a carer had taken a resident’s bank card and withdrawn money for her own use. During the investigation process Cowan started to make repayments of the outstanding amount. At the hearing in Dundee the victim was described as a “lonely and vulnerable inidual” but “very switched on” and an “impressive witness” who gave her evidence in a forthright manner and was found to be both “credible” and “reliable.” In their written judgement the SSSC found Cowan’s conduct fell “far below the standards” expected, labelled her actions were “serious and deliberate” and amounted to a “signicant breach of trust.” The Panel also stated they could not be satisfied that Cowan had “acknowledged the gravity” of her conduct, or that she demonstrated “meaningful regret.” The judgement concluded: “A Removal Order is the only sanction that will provide an adequate safeguard against yourepeating your misconduct. “It is the only sanction that will ensure that service users are not placed at risk of harm and will maintain public confidence in social services and the SSSC as regulator.” Cowan was neither present nor represented at the hearing. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: “We are aware of the situation and understand that care home management acted appropriately in conjunction with Scottish Social Service Council and Care Inspectorate when they learned about allegations against the member of staff. “Through our contract management arrangements we actively engage with all the care homes in East Ayrshire to provide assurance in respect of the quality of service provided to residents.” The Post did contact Glebe House Care Home for a response but did not receive one.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrEast Ayrshire CouncilSocial servicesDundee"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14904281.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18944840.jpg","title":"ayr united startlet tipped make","story":"NewsAyr United startlet tipped to make big time -he avoids video game FortniteLuke McCowan won praise from boss Ian McCall after a brilliant debut in Ayrs - win at Firhill on Saturday.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsMcCowan is being tipped for big things\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall has tipped Ayr Unitedaposs newest star to make a name for himself - as long as he stays off computer games.

But historic County Buildings is also a modern workplace housing  staff delivering services for more than , people in South Ayrshire. From the grandeur of Provost Helen Moonie’s luxurious sea-view office to the dingy corridors of the basement, the  landmark is full of character. Our Local Democracy Reporter went on a ‘behind the scenes’ tour guided by council depute chief executive Douglas Hutchison. Looking around County Buildings, it is clear to see that history speaks through the detailed decor oozing out of every cornice. Two sweeping staircases sparkle with stunning stained-glass windows which hark back to the time when the whole of Ayrshire was ided into burghs. Each burgh had a crest, which are intricately etched into the glass. They include Ayr, Irvine, Troon Prestwick, Darvel, Kilmarnock, Largs and Saltcoats among others.  Nowadays Ayrshire is ruled by three separate councils but the County Buildings design still echoes a past when Ayr reigned supreme. Its former position of housing the entire admininstrative work of the county is reflected in its extravagant architecture. The main council chambers where all major decisions take place have sleek slide-back oak  – which open into other rooms. The chambers could have one of the finest council views in the country overlooking the Firth of Clyde. Every committee room has an open fireplace, which would have warmed the wind-battered building before central heating. Another room has a glass display cabinet showing a town clerk wig and Royal Burgh of Ayr Truncheon among other artefacts. Councillors have their own swish ‘members library’ with newspapers, tea and coffee. The details of meetings taking place behind closed doors are still written in old-fashioned chalk on the front of blackboards. Showing us around, Mr Hutchison said: “This the front face of the council where the council business takes place.” The director of people also took us to a secret location – a secure vault – which opens into a large room for storingpostal votes.Now there is a mission to make the historic building more up to date to adhere with current workday practices. The original architecture is in conflict with the needs of a al workplace where open-plan is the norm. Attempts to fit more people into open- plan space means walls must come down but due to the listed status of the landmark all alterations must be carefully managed. There is also a need to make room for staff coming from the John Pollock centre and soon-to-be demolished Burns House. In contrast to the splendid offices and committee meeting rooms on the first floor, a newly renovated office for employee services staff features skylights and a purple meeting pod. Mr Hutchison said: “It is a lovely building. But trying to fit a modern working environment into an old building is not easy. There is a lot going on to make it more modern. We need to make more efficient use of space. The days of everybody turning up at their desks are gone. We have to work more flexibly.” Mr Hutchison showed us empty offices stripped bare, which are currently awaiting a facelt. Money to maintain the seat of power is ongoing with windows getting replaced along with other repairs. Mr Hutchison said: “There is a programme of general investment in the building.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsMuseumsKilmarnockIrvineCosmetic surgeryFirth of ClydeTroonDarvelPrestwickLargsSaltcoats"},{"url":null,"title":"debenhams ayr stay open department","story":"NewsDebenhams in Ayr to stay open as department store announces list of  stores to closeThe department store giant has revealed the first list of stores set to close early next year.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsDebenhams is an anchor store for Ayr Central \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailScores of jobs have been spared after Debenhams confirmed their outlet in Ayr Central shopping mall is to survive an initial axe.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilArmed forcesAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-with-multiple-sclerosis-shares-her-story","story":"A Galashiels woman with multiple sclerosishas shared her story to show support for MS research in Scotland.Kirsty Bennett, , works in finance and was diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS in .Today marks the beginning of MS Awareness Week.MS Society Scotland are raising support for research that hopes to find a cure for the condition.

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe. Many of the chemicals we were using then have now been banned as unsafe for one reason or another.ldquoI fear the same sort of thing will happen with mobile technologies, the overuse of which masts like this one will encourage ndash technologies which are described as essential but are more often than not simply recreational or convenient.In a submission to council planners, the developers have tried to address some of the issues raised by the objectors.Damian Hosker, the principal planner at WHP Telecoms, writes: ldquoG connectivity enables iniduals and businesses to work and ecommerce effectively from home.ldquoThis means that car travel can be reduced which has a positive effect on the environment.ldquoMobile connectivity creates a sustainable community and promotes environmental issues.ldquoThe proposal is set against the backdrop of the forest. The screening could not be more prominent. WHP will, however, paint the installation green or brown or whatever colour the local planning authority wishes to see.ldquoThe value of property is not a planning issue, however, in an age where connectivity is ever more important for e-commerce, including: real-time tax s education health services requirement to attract tourists social wellbeing and emergencies there is expected to be a positive value to property as a result of being connected.ldquoNo connectivity in the UK is not acceptable to purchasers in the st century.As a result of the number of objections received, the application will be decided by councillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee.The committee is due to meet on Monday, April  to deliberate on the proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"community-group-targets-steading-to-ease-ettrick-housing-demand","story":"PLANS are in place for a community development company to buy a redundant steading in the Ettrick Valley to ease housing pressures.With many farm and estate cottages being sold over the past decade or so, affordable rentable accommodation in the rural valleys south of Selkirk has dwindled.The Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Companyhope to reverse the trend by buying Kirkhope Steading, outside of Ettrickbridge, and convert the buildings into inexpensive homes to rent.EYCDC have also launched a housing survey to identy the demand for affordable housing in the area.The group have commissioned Rural Housing Scotland to independently run the survey to gauge opinion on affordable rent, buying prices, size and type of home required.A paper copy of the survey, along with a reply paid envelope, can be found in the Post Office in Selkirk, Honey Cottage Caravan Park shop in Ettrick, the Cross Keys pub in Ettrickbridge and from the Gordon Arms in Yarrow.The survey form can also be filled in online at https:www.surveymonkey r TNDLDIn , a full survey was carried out which highlighted a need for more affordable housing in the Ettrick and Yarrow Valleys.And it is thought the need has increased signicantly during the past  years.Project Manager of EYCDC, Vicky Davidson said: ldquoWe are concerned that the lack of affordable housing is impacting on the number of children living in the valleys, with fewer families and young people able to find somewhere to live.\"We are urging anyone who might be interested in living in the valleys but do not think they are able to find a suitable house, at an affordable rent, to complete the housing survey as soon as possible.\"And to pass on the survey link to anyone who might like toto live there now or within the next couple of yearsthere was an affordable option available.\"The EYCDCs plans for Kirkhope Steading include some workspace areas and potential office units as well as rentable housing.Funding has been provided by the Scottish Land Fund to carry out an independent valuation, get a structural engineers report and to prepare some architect options for the site.This work is now complete and it was presented to a public meeting in Ettrickbridge on April .The proposal is to start work on the site in the beginning of  and be at completion during spring the following year.For more information contact info@ettrickandyarrow.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"council-to-chip-in-extra-42k-for-hawick-regeneration-scheme","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has agreed to chip in an extra pound, for a Hawick regeneration scheme, in order to receive a million pound grant from Scottish ministers.The local authority has already been awarded pound.m from Historic Environment Scotland to fund the Hawick Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme .However, the council intended to provide just pound, to the pot, to acquire a pound.m grant, but instead has had to stump up an extra pound, in order to secure pound.m.Along with private sector contributions of pound,, the project will have a budget of pound.m to go towards restoring shop fronts and historic buildings in the town centre.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council executive committee on Tuesday, April , councillors waved through the extra money and emphasised the positives the CARS scheme will bring to Hawick.Hawick and Hermitage councillor George Turnbull told the meeting: ldquoThis is a great news item for Hawick and will help with the town centre regeneration.ldquoIrsquod just like to publicly record my thanks to the team which has put in so much work to achieve this, I wish the project well and every success over the next five years.Kelso and District councillor Tom Weatherston, who has experienced the CARS scheme in Kelso, added: ldquoI welcome this as great news for Hawick.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things like electricity, running water, showers and fridges.ldquoI now live a fairly simple le and, to be honest, I feel happier doing so."},{"url":null,"title":"how-much-has-duncs-big-quiz-raised-so-far","story":"ONE of the biggest quizzes to ever take place in the Scottish Borders has now raised well over pound, for charity since it began.The Big Quiz this year saw over  people cram into the Volunteer Hall in Galashiels, with over pound, generated on the night for Prostate Scotland charity.This years winners were The Brownlees who won by half a point from Ginrsquoll Fix It, followed by #thatsjustrude in third place.The event is now in its eighth year, and has been organised each time by Lucy McAneny in memory of her father, Duncan Paterson who passed away a decade ago.Lucy said: ldquoA huge thank you once again to all who helped in advance and on the night, as well as all the teams who entered and have now helped raise over pound, for Prostate Scotland which is an excellent charity which is close to the hearts of our family.ldquoWe look forward to seeing you all again in ."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn-under-pressure-to-commit-labour-to-confirmatory-brexit-deal-referendum","story":"Jeremy Corbyn will face pressure to commit Labour to a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal when his partyrsquos governing body meet later to agree its European election manesto.The ruling National Executive Committee is to gather on Tuesday for a crunch meeting to finalise the partyrsquos position on Brexit for next monthrsquos polls.It comes as cross-party talks aiming to break the impasse continue, with the de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington describing discussions on Monday as ldquopositive and ldquoproductive.And the EUrsquos chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he hoped to see results this week from the talks, and reiterated a call to ldquofix Brexit quickly.--vw,vw,px, px\"Michel Barnier said he hoped to see results this week from the cross-party talks --Meanwhile Change UK ndash the Independent Group ndash will hold the first of its ldquoPeoplersquos Vote Remain rallies in London calling for a second referendum.

sports pitches, were formulated last year.However, public consultation showed little appetite for any changes to be made.Dunbar Community Council received word on Monday evening that a further consultation was being planned, despite the apparent lack of interest in any alterations.George Robertson, community councillor and chair of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership , noted that there was no funding available to make any of the proposals happen.He said: ldquoIt is a wishlist of things ndash it is not going to be happening any time soon.ldquoThat is the long and the short of it.ldquoIf you are interested in the future of the park obviously come along to the meeting and have your say but do not expect anything to happen any time soon.Included among the ideas is the possibility of creating a ldquopavilion with toilets in the style of the pagoda recently demolished, as well as a series of paths and information cairns.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the community council, was ldquosurprised to receive an email highlighting an upcoming meeting, which is due to take place on Wednesday, where discussions will take place on the plans for the park.She pointed to the public consultation which took place last year in the townrsquos Bleachingfield Centre.At that time, a display featuring a series of images and information boards highlighted potential changes to the park, including new seating and picnic benches, as well as a maze and parkour course.Long-term aspirations also included the suggestion of creating a replacement pavilion with access to public toilets.Winterfield Pagoda, also known as Winterfield Pavilion, which had stood in the park since the s, was torn down by East Lothian Council in March .ldquoIn general, there was no massive enthusiasm for proposed changes, adding paths or parkour, or anything , said Mrs Swan.ldquoI was taken aback that East Lothian Council had seen fit to continue with a masterplan.Mrs Swan, who was previously DELAP chairwoman, also noted that budgets were increasingly tight at the local authority and funding would likely have to come from external organisations.She added: ldquoI still feel immediate priorities should be addressed first and scarce resources addressing immediate wishes of the community as expressed in the first instance.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said work to develop ldquoa programme of improvements for the park had been ongoing since .She said: ldquoFrom the outset it was made clear that financing any improvements would be challenging but that in itself was not justication for ignoring the need.ldquoThe benefit of having a masterplan in place means thatopportunity presented itself, either by way of outside funding or sources of materials, inidual elements of the plan could perhaps be delivered without detriment to the wider plan.ldquoThe council has used this model of planning very successfully on a number of other sites, the most recent being Ormiston Park where signicant improvements have been delivered.ldquoFollowing the most recent meeting to discuss the draft masterplan, the council was advised by the steering group that, although work was still required on what the plan should contain, the general principles of delivering improvements were still widely supported by the local community."},{"url":null,"title":"seven-year-old-praised-for-taking-action-to-stop-dog-fouling","story":"Seven-year-old Ava Lily Davidson, a P pupil at Stoneyhill Primary School, was inspired to make

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

He has been in the same post for nearly four years and is in Prime Minister Theresa Mays Cabinet.: SNP members support new currency as soon as practicableSitting in his office in the west end of Edinburgh - two pillows nestle on the sofa, one with a saltire and the other emblazoned with a Union Jack - the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale  Tweeddale is keen to mention his role in post-devolution politics.However, achievements of the past cannot mask problems of the present. Mundell is at the centre of two constitutional storms that show little sign of settling down.We met twenty four hours after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for another independence referendum, a policy he vigorously opposes.He is also the Scottish Tory face of Mayrsquos troubled Brexit deal, which has been rejected by MPs on three occasions. Brexit has been delayed and voters will have the opportunity to vote in the European elections next month. The Tories are expecting a drubbing.ldquoItrsquos inevitable now, Mundell says of the elections, wearily. ldquoWersquove run out of time. The reason we are having it is one of the reasons I think many people voted to leave the EU, in the sense that lsquorules are rulesrsquo.Askedhe expected the election would be dficult for his party, he replies: ldquoAll the evidence would suggest that it is going to be a challenge, but wersquove had challenges before.The Governmentrsquos focus is on producing an alternative set of proposals that could command the support of MPs. With Tory right wingers opposed to Mayrsquos deal, the Prime Minister has turned to Labour, who are demanding a customs union.Mundell has previously said the Government would be ldquowilling to discuss such a proposal. However, would he be willing to discuss having a confirmatory vote, which would pit Mayrsquos deal against Remain in another referendum ldquoThe Government doesnrsquot support a confirmatory vote. I donrsquot support a confirmatory vote. Wersquove had two attempts to bring that forward in the House of Commons, he says.ldquoMy personal view is that there is not a majority of MPs in the House of Commons for a confirmatory vote. I donrsquot think there is a logic to it.Mundell campaigned for Remain in  and is known to have a disregard for some of his more bloody-minded Brexiteer colleagues.I have three shots at asking him how he would vote in the event of a second referendum,the choice was between Mayrsquos plan and Remain.ldquoI want to respect the outcome of the referendum wersquove had, so I donrsquot want there to be another referendum, he says. That was a dodge.I press again. Would he back Mayrsquos deal in another referendum  ldquoIrsquom not trying to evade the question.

Brexit matters to them more than any of the circumstances around it, or other things that are happening.Paul Hutcheon: Nicola Sturgeons route to indyref is through Jeremy CorbynGeorge Osborne, the former Tory chancellor, was revealed recently to have argued against holding an EU referendum before it became Government policy.I ask Mundell, who has always had a pragmatic view on the EU,he was also privately sceptical at that time.ldquoI felt that we had committed to doing it and I felt there wasnrsquot any way of not doing it, having committed to doing it, he says, cryptically.Mundell believes the problem was in the EU reform package Cameron negotiated with European partners ahead of the referendum.If the EU had given more ground, particularly on freedom of movement, Mundell believes this could have shted the dial.ldquoIf David Cameron had been able to secure a dferent package, a better package...that might have ended up dferently.Mundell was an early supporter of Cameron. He backed his leadership bid in  and warmed to his social liberalism. However, Cameronrsquos stock has plummeted after becoming the unwitting architect of a policy - Brexit - he never wanted.He says he has ldquono regrets about voting for Cameron, but concedes the former Prime Minister may have a problem with his legacy.ldquoAs at this moment, he is defined by that referendum and the result, he says.ldquoIn ten years time, we will be able to make that judgement, as to whether that is entirely the dominant feature, in the way that the Iraq war has become Tony Blairrsquos legacy.ldquoWhether we see David Cameron solely in that context or not, I donrsquot know. I hope not.Tory MSPs are becoming increasingly restless about the Brexit farce. Their party made impressive gains at the last general election and are focused on trying to win the Holyrood poll in . Does Mundell believe Brexit is harming Ruth Davidsonrsquos chances of becoming First Minister ldquoI donrsquot think it is, because Ruth will very clearly in the  election set out to people what the clear choice in that election is, which is Nicola Sturgeon continuing as First Minister, independence and a threat of a referendum never going away, compared to Ruthrsquos offer, he says.Mundell is also taking an interest in who will succeed May, given that she wonrsquot contest the next general election:He wants the next Tory leader to have a strong commitment to the Union and be socially liberal: ldquoI want somebody who has a modern outlook and who is in touch with modern le, and how people live their lives.Boris Johnson, who has caused major problems for May, will not be his choice. Mundell has already ruled out serving in a Johnson Cabinet and aims a few more darts in his direction:ldquoI donrsquot think that he is someone who does particularly gel in Scotland.Mundell says Johnson has not had many dealings with Scotland, other than an ldquoill-fated tilt at becoming Edinburgh Universityrsquos rector:ldquoHe has not dipped his toe signicantly into the Scottish political scene. He is not necessarily somebody who has an obvious affinity with Scotland.Mundellrsquos analysis on the attributes of the next leader may be persuasive, but his comments on social liberalism niggle.In the very early days of the Scottish Parliament, when Mundell was a Tory MSP, his party launched a nasty campaign opposing the repeal of anti-gay legislation relating to schools.: SNP councillor snubbed as candidate after being quizzed on Salmond-Sturgeon rtMundell, who later came out as gay, voted against the repeal of what was then called Section . Does he regret how he voted ldquoIt was a point in time.

What has been achieved in that period of twenty years has [been] a wholesale change in attitude, here in Scotland and across the UK, he replies.Back to the day job, his Cabinet colleague David Liddington last week ruled out a second independence referendum - by way of sanctioning a Section  order - before .Mundell goes further. Askedhe could ever imagine a Tory Government agreeing a section  order, he says:ldquoNo, I canrsquot envisage that circumstance.He then softens slightly: ldquoWersquove had a referendum. It was to be a once-in-a-generation event.

However, many former rail routes remain intact and ready to be reused.The report adds: ldquoThe asset value of this dormant infrastructure could be measured in the billions of pounds, and therefore Glasgow has a ready-made basis for enhanced rapid transit that most cities can only dream about.The first priority of any wider transport strategy, the Commission argues, should be creating a Glasgowsystem, using parts of the existing heavy rail network as well as entirely new sections ndash including some running alongside roads.Meanwhile, old, disused rail routes ndash such as the former Central Low Level Line via the Botanic Gardens to Maryhill ndash would be reopened.The Commission recommends building a link between the airport and Paisley Gilmour Street station by  as the first leg of aline that would then be extended to connect Renfrew ndash the largest town in Scotland without a rail station ndash Braehead Shopping Centre and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital to the city centre.Over the next two decades, this route could then be extended across the city.Elsewhere, a ldquostrategic intervention is required to make Glasgow ready for high-speed rail.The only credible option, the report suggests, is to redesign and revamp Central station. This would require, at the very least, the extension of the station over the River Clyde and the creation of a new southern entrance and concourse roughly on the site of the former Bridge Street station.Meanwhile, the Commission advocates ldquoplugging the gap between Queen Street and Central stations to permanently rid Glasgow of the barrier ldquoimposed by the separation of the cityrsquos two main railway stations.This would involve delivering on longstanding proposals to construct a new tunnel linking the existing rail networks on either side of the Clyde.The most straightforward option, the report argues, is for a tunnel to cut across the city centre, starting from the Shields Road area to the south of the Clyde and continuing north, before joining the existing rail network near Cowlairs. A new, two- underground station between Central and Queen Street would give access to the line.This option would provide around  trains an hour across the city and transform rail services throughout Scotlandrsquos central belt, while a new station at Cowlairs could be ldquothe centrepiece of an extended major redevelopment area.More ambitious plans for ldquotunnelled junctions on either side of the city centre could further revolutionise services, creating a ldquotruly comprehensive regional express rail network.While the most dramatic proposals in the report focus on rail, it also suggests moves to prioritise buses on Glasgowrsquos motorways to improve journey times and reduce traffic congestion.Meanwhile, it argues Scotland should \"lead the way\" when it comes to preparing for the sht to electric and self-driving vehicles. With fuel duty receipts expected to plummet, new ways to pay for road use will need to be found.Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council, said the blueprint had the potential to boost economic growth and give Glasgow the competitive edge it needs to compete globally.Mark Johnston, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said the \"ambition for a city-wide metro system starting at the airport is forward thinking and could address some of the major transport issues facing the city region\".He added: ldquoWe agree with the Commissionrsquos calls for the airport link to be delivered by  which will require firm commitments from the relevant organisations.

What absolute balderdash.First, most people would accept that eventhe UK leaves the EU as in a \"soft\" Brexit, it will be very challenging, but at least Britain has its own currency, a very low fiscal deficit and has many years of experience exportingto countries under WTO-based rules.

At the other end the Conservatives, UKIP and the Brexit Party do not want a referendum on either subject.In between are, first, the Liberal Democratswho would like another referendum on Brexit but not on independence and, second, the Labour party who are clear they oppose another ballot on independence but are neither definitely for or against another Brexit ballot.:Sturgeon warns party must convince voters Scottish independence will not damage economyConsequently, whatever may be the position where in the UK, in Scotland the Euro-elections will be about more than Brexit. They will also be the occasion for another round in Scotlandrsquos continuing constitutional debate, especially given that last week the First Minister re-affirmed her wish to hold another independence referendum sooner rather than later. But what will be the impact of this double fault line Are not all of the parties at risk of chasing no more than relatively small niche markets  After all, in the last Euro-elections in , held before the UKrsquos membership of the EU had become such a live issue , no party won as much as % of the vote and only the SNP and Labour secured more than %.The potentially cross-cutting nature of the two debates was very clear at the time of the EU referendum. Even though the SNPrsquos vision of independence has for nearly thirty years been one of independence inside the European Union, as many as one in three of those who voted Yes in  backed Leave .The unionist camp was ided on Brexit too, with just over two-fth of those who voted No backing Leave. No single combination of independence and Brexit support represented more than % of voters.Yet two polls published at the weekend both suggested that the SNP was heading for as much as % or so of the vote, more or less in line with its current popularity for both Westminster and Holyrood. Rather than simply winning much more than a niche market, the party seems set for its best performance yet in a Euro-election.The explanation lies in the fact that, these days, the SNP not only dominates among Yes voters in a way that it never did before the  but also has become very much the most favoured party among Remainers north of the border. Thus, while as many as two-thirds of those who voted Yes in  say they will vote for the SNP next month, so also do almost a half of those who voted Remain.Either pattern on its own is enough to secure the SNP at least % of the vote. Meanwhile, not every voter fits the general pattern and, despite the partyrsquos stance on Brexit and independence, around one on five Leave voters and about one in eight No voters also say they will back Nicola Sturgeonrsquos party.True, even many SNP voters are doubtful about the idea of holding another independence referendum as quickly as Ms Sturgeon has in mind. However, nine in ten are in favour of holding one at some point in the future. For most SNP supporters the question is an issue of timing rather than one of principle and seems unlikely to motivate them to change their minds.Butthe SNP are able to win over much more than a niche market, nobody  is able to do so. For a start, not only does the SNPrsquos popularity among Remain voters leave little more than crumbs left for their fellow supporters of a second EU referendum - the Liberal Democrats, Change UK, and the Greens - but it also means that, in contrast to the position south of the border, support for Labour among Remain votersis only modestly higher than it is among Leave supporters . This does not make it any easier for the party to mount a performance that might mark a recovery in the partyrsquos fortunes.Even so, there would still seem to be plenty of room for a party that stands for both Brexit and the Union.:Scottish independence poll: One in five Scots back Nicola Sturgeons Indyref planBut while that might be how the Conservatives think of themselves, their failure to deliver the former means the formula that served the party so well in  no longer does so now.The initial Euro-polling suggests that only just over in fiveof those who voted Leave will back the party on May . Even many a Leaver voter who would still be loyal to the party in a Holyrood or Westminster election indicates that they will not back it for the Euros.They are minded instead to protest against the UK governmentrsquos failure to deliver Brexit by voting for Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party. It already seems to be the single most popular party among Leave voters, albeit still only backed by no more than one in three, and seems to be in with a good chance of winning one of the six seats that will be up for grabs, matching UKIPrsquos achievement in .A Conservative collapse, a weakened Labour party, and the unionist vote scattered to the four winds.

Itrsquos just a misunderstanding of what nationhood really entails in the st century.Read more:European election results can help Nicola Sturgeon in push for Scottish independenceMr Blair told the IoG that people in the UK should think more carefully about how they had a British and UK identity and not just an English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh one.ldquoThatrsquos important. People used to think it was a bit trivial when I used to say we should put the football leagues togetherhellipItrsquos just you need to find ways in which people are realising they have a lot in common, as well as space for the ersity of the UK. Irsquod do a lot more of that.He explained how once devolution occurred, even institutions like the BBC ldquobecame separated in a very clear way. You just lost that sense of a common agenda that you are waking up to every day. Obviously, thatrsquos now happenedhellipWe need to be more active and passionate in our defence of the Union. And maybeone good thing comes out, once we get rid of this Brexit thing, is that we really need to think about what is the place of the UK in the world and why is it sensible for countries to be together in the UK.Reflecting on the two decades since the first elections to a ldquoreconvened Scottish Parliament, the former PM said it was important for Labour to have succeeded particularly in Scotland, where the support for independence would have been \"unstoppable without devolution.He said the issue of Scotlandrsquos future was a continuing debate but noted: ldquoWersquore still the UK and wersquore still together so yoursquove got to put a tick there. Are there still pressures for secession  Well, in Scotland, yes, but I still think they wonrsquot succeed unless Brexit pushes us into a position where that kind of gets Scottish independence over the lineyou have[a] hard Brexit, which is possible.ldquoAnd in Northern Ireland, without Brexit I would be very confident that the Union would stick together but again Brexit is an issue there.Read more:Scottish independence: How and when Scotland could rejoin the EUIt was suggested to Mr Blair thatBrexit happened, it would be very hard to resist demands for a second Scottish independence referendum because the facts would have changed.He replied: ldquoYes, the facts will have changed. I still think we should be very careful doing it[indyref] unless itrsquos clear that therersquos a huge groundswell for it. You know, one of things that Brexit has taught us is the danger of playing around with referendums in our country. These are big decisions which alter the whole nature of the country.And yet the former PM decried David Cameron for not proposing a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal against the status quo.ldquoItrsquos obviously sensible that once you negotiate a settlement you say: lsquoTell us: do you prefer the house yoursquore in or the house you are moving to rsquo Thatrsquos reasonable.In the interview, Mr Blair referred to the ldquoBrexit imbroglio and decried what he described as English Nationalism within and outwith Westminster.ldquoWhatrsquos weird at the moment is yoursquove got Conservative MPs like the Boris Johnsons, the Rees-Moggs, who say theyrsquore vigorous Unionists but are actually really playing on English Nationalism, he explained.Read more:Polls show almost half of Scots think immigration levels too highldquoIrsquom quite shocked by the amount of people who are Brexiteers in England who, when you put to them that it could cause a strain on the Union, just kind of shrug their shoulders and say: lsquoWell, we donrsquot care.rsquo I mean, itrsquos just really shocking, actually. Because thatrsquos just profoundly ignorant of our history, whatrsquos brought us to here and the way the world is changing outside the UK.In the years following devolution, Mr Blair suggested: ldquoThe most interesting development in Scotland has been the decline of the Labour Party and the resurgence of the Conservative Party. Now, that has been very simply because the Conservatives have spotted a gap in the market that Labour have left pro-Union, pro-reform.The former PM added: ldquoBy the way,  years is not long in a new constitutional settlement.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline.

Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"thainstone prepares for annual show and sale","story":"Aberdeen and Northern Marts# Thainstone Centre is gearing up for its annual show and sale of commercial breeding cattle and pedigree bulls and females next week.The show and sale of heers with calves at foot and other commercial breeding cattle, sponsored by East Coast Viners, will commence on Tuesday, April  with the show in Ring  at am, followed by the sale at am.Judges for the pre-sale show are Will MacDonald, Tormore and Kris Sutherland, Dunbeath Farms.Included in the offering of  breeding cattle is top-quality Simmental cross, Limousin cross and Salers cross heers, with spring-born calves at foot, many with show ring potential.All heers have been selected for their milking and breeding ability.On the same day, the annual show and sale of pedigree bulls and females, sponsored by Ardene Vets, has attracted  bulls and three females.Orkney’s Liam Muir from Upper Onston, will judge the pedigree bulls from am onwards in the Exchange and the sale will commence at .pm in Ring .Forward for sale is  Charolais, nine Limousin, eight Simmental, seven Salers, five Aberdeen-Angus, two British Blue, two Beef Shorthorn and  Gascone.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Vandals strike at Inverurie school viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"vandals strike at inverurie school","story":"Police Scotland is appealing for witnesses after trees were vandalised at an Inverurie school.A number of trees were damaged at Strathburn Primary School on two separate occasions between Thursday  and Monday  April.PC James Stewart said: \"The trees had been planted by pupils at the school and have been damaged beyond repair.\"This act of vandalism is completely mindless and is not only extremely upsetting for the school community but will be costly to remedy.\"Anyone with information is asked to contact police on  using ref. no.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments.

Now, however, it is time to bid readers of these pages adieu – or more appropriately, au revoir.I need to take my leave for the foreseeable future as I have decided to contest the European elections I would rather were not being held in the UK at all. So that columnists do not gain an advantage for themselves or a party it is a Scotsman convention thatthey take part in elections they step back from their regular slot. Sometimes they , possibly chastened, maybe emboldened – sometimes they don’t.Over the years I have had my detractors. As a Scottish unionist libertarian I inhabit a subset of a subset that makes my writing usually contrary to the prevailing view. I can live with that, but I cannot accept a vote of the people being ignored.Thus I am, paradoxically, about to stand as a Brexit Party candidate for the European Parliament I have argued our country should no longer be part of. I believe strongly this election puts the people’s trust in democracy at great risk.To maintain our belief in the value of voting, especially in referenda where everyone’s vote counts, it is necessary to give a voice to the anger, the disgust and the disappointment that many now hold for the politicians who have lied persistently and without shame about honouring the result of the  vote to leave the EU.Some readers might remember the time when a majority of those Scots who voted in the referendum of  supported the creation of a Scottish assembly – but not in great enough numbers to meet the legal threshold that would make it a reality. There was palpable outrage among many that the decision did not count. Imagine then that the vote for a Scottish Parliament in the referendum of  had been ignored by the Labour government of the day that had promised to deliver it  Or imagineScotland had voted for independence in  and three years later the SNP government had, despite repeated promises, failed to deliver it – encouraged to fail by a Westminster government serving a cocktail of threats, bullying and political chicanery.The electorate would be beyond itself with anger and indignation, incredulous that a democratic decision had not been respected and honoured.I have warned many times from these pages that the Conservative Government and the Labour opposition are trying the patience of the voters for stating they would abide by the vote to leave the EU on  June  only to continually go back on their word. I cannot recall a period, certainly not in this country nor in my letime, when so many promises have been made – and repeated for emphasis – only to be broken without any concern for the damage it does to the credibility of all politicians or the debasement of democracy.I cannot recall ever a British Cabinet that has so callously abandoned collective responsibility so government becomes anarchic and impotent – and ministers might vote against their official position but carry on taking their superannuated paycheque.I cannot believe a British government would be so willing to accept one part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, would operate under dferent commercial regulations where the only recourse to representation about such damaging rules would be through representatives of a neighbouring foreign power. Nor can I believe the same government cannot see its dalliance with a second referendum only strengthens the hands of separatists in Scotland who wish for a second vote too.The leaders of both main parties opposed Brexit and lost. They defined what Brexit would look like , that there would be no EU army, and amplied at full volume the immediate economic crisis we would facewe voted against their advice . Yet, for all the foregoing scaremongering the electorate decided in our biggest democratic vote ever to “take back control” of our laws, our money and our borders. Since then we have seen the creation of an EU army and the surreptitious offer of our military forces to it. We have seen the best growth of the largest economies in the EU, witnessed our employment grow by a staggering , and the UK become the top destination for foreign investment in the world.It was as a result of the electorate’s expressed will the new Prime Minister, Theresa May, promised us “Brexit means Brexit” – only for her to ensure in her tin-eared dogmatic detachment that now Brexit must mean remain. Her withdrawal treaty will mean continuing with the very rules and regulations we were told could be reformed or abolished, that direct trade deals with other nations cannot be realised and that customs tarfs that ensure our food and clothing costs more cannot be reduced.We will leave the Common Fisheries Policy one minute only to rejoin it immediately the next. Worse still, being an international treaty it cannot be amended and offers us no break clause for escape. With so many of May’s promises broken her words and phrases have lost all meaning when “no deal” was once “better than a bad deal” – it is now her bad deal.The law of the land was we would “leave the EU on  March”. Conservative and Labour MPs voted together by a huge majority for it to happen, deal or no deal. If they had been sincere in their promises we would now have left and no elections would be necessary. I have previously been invited toto the political fray, but on all occasions I found it easy to decline. This time is dferent, this time giving electors a means to defend democracy itself by campaigning for a party that believes in having the referendum respected is something I cannot ignore, despite the economic risk to my livelihood.So it is au revoir as I join others of all walks of le, from left and right, all races, religions and genders – but who believe democracy matters.I thank you all for you comments in the past, be they supportive or critical. The result I cannot predict, but democracy will have been given the opportunity to triumph over cynicism.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"your nationality won t matter if we wreck the planet christine jardine","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...As Brexit and independence distract our politicians, important issues like the need to tackle climate change # as highlighted by campaigner Greta Thunberg # are not being properly addressed, writes Christine Jardine.I came face to face this week with the reality of that old saying about how it is often from the mouths of young people that we hear the truth.Sixteen-year-old Swede Greta Thunburg has sparked an international protest movement by speaking out about her fears for the future of the planet. This week the almost stereotypical Scandinavian schoolgirl in her blonde pigtails told a packed room of MPs where we are getting it wrong. And she was right.Too little time recently has been dedicated to looking at how we are damaging the planet, undermining the future of generations to come and destroying the natural world. More importantly we are letting the valuable and scarce time we have left to change things slip through our fingers.That was also not my only encounter this week with a younger generation frustrated at the adult world’s lack of action to protect their environment. On Friday morning I visited a group of pupils at Cramond Primary School in my constituency to see their campaign to clean up the air they breathe every day.Their presentation was impressive but so too was their commitment that their world is under threat and that we are all responsible. Everything they said echoed what I had heard earlier from Greta, and not just about climate change.Too often recently that word responsibility has seemed absent from British politics. It has seemed that nobody really wanted to take responsibility for the mess we are in and fix it. Old party lines, and ingrained tribalism, always seemed to win the day.That is where the another, inspirational, moment of the week could, potentially, be important in tackling not just climate change, but every other major issue challenging us at this moment.Midweek I took part in the official launch of More United, a network of MPs from seven dferent political parties who are working to find progressive solutions to issues that are being completely ignored because of the Brexit saga.: Greta Thunberg: Expansion of North Sea oil fields is beyond absurdIt should not actually be big news but it was. Myself and colleagues from other parties were on television, radio and where explaining how important we feel it is to build consensus. To work together. That way you achieve progress.As an example, earlier this year I joined forces with Labour’s Tulip Siddiq and Nicky Morgan from the Conservatives to lead a joint campaign on immigration. Our approach was simple: we wrote to , More United members asking for their views on what needed to be changed in our immigration and asylum system.The , people who responded were, of course, split on whether they thought immigration had had a positive or negative effect on their own community. But the consultation revealed a shared desire for practical steps to build a new immigration policy that would support our economy and local communities, without being unnecessarily cruel or xenophobic.The three of us then met the Home Secretary, who, in the face of such powerful cross-party collaboration, had no choice but to listen to our proposals.The fact that the three of us were able to put aside our dferences to work together on an issue that we cared deeply about is, I hope, a tribute to the memory of our late colleague Jo Cox.It was Jo who reminded us that there is more that unites us than separates us. We have more in common than ides us.The country is crying out for politics to be done dferently, for the toxic and hostile atmosphere to be changed and for politicians who disagree fundamentally on some issues to work together when they do agree.: UK economy ‘losing £m because of Brexit every week’Ironically while Brexit has, at times, stretched that capacity to work together to breaking point, it has also cemented agreement between politicians who often have little other common belief.Many of those I work with in More United are the colleagues I have also worked with to try to find a compromise solution on Brexit. To break the impasse between those of us who want to stay, and those who want to leave, by taking any proposed deal back to the people.But, while I could see how this could help answer the questions asked by those young people, there was one dark cloud on the political horizon. Just when it looked aswe might be taking that responsibility seriously.Putting real issues back on the agenda and working towards fixing the things that actually blight peoples’ lives every day. Up popped another political process row about how we define our identities. Independence.I’m not going to rehearse the arguments here. My views on independence are well known. There is only one thing I really need to get off my chest about it.For three years now, the country has been torn apart by an argument about leaving the European Union. In Scotland, we had years of ision and bitterness before that about whether to walk away from the United Kingdom.In that time, the issues that those children I met this week in Cramond, that Greta Thunburg and millions of teenagers across the globe are protesting about, or that families come to my office about every week, were sidelined. To be blunt,we get absorbed in arguments about our identity we risk losing sight of what really matters.If we destroy our planet it will not matterwe call ourselves Scottish, British, European or anything  for that matter. Listening this week to a younger generation express their fears about their future and how this generation of decision-makers might be damaging it I was more convinced than ever.It’s time we stopped thinking about our dferences and worked on progressive solutions to the problems which we all face. Most things are more important than isions.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch the independence campaign must go beyond tribes","story":"Nicola Sturgeon should press ahead with a Citizens# Assembly as soon as possible, writes Lesley RiddochAnyone notice that Brexit news faded away a bit last week  There was one reason. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s intention to hold another independence referendum before  attracted a predictable and immediate rebuff from the British government and the usual pelters from Unionist parties. But her statement made one thing clear – Scotland’s future is finally making news again. And a focus on our future instead of England’s past makes a very welcome change after three long years of irrationality, parliamentary hopelessness and back-stabbing at Westminster.With any luck, and some boldness from the SNP leadership, Scotland’s future can easily become the shape of the summer.The cleverest word in the SNP leader’s midweek speech was easily swallowed by her fiercest political and media critics – options. The suggestion that Brexit presents Scots with options is seductively simple. But it contains the acknowledgement that the status quo is only one of many possible futures. It may have habit, vested interests and familiarity behind it. For some, it may also have nostalgia, family links and a political belief system.But it is just an option. Others are available. And once you accept that, the future of the Union sits on a gey shoogly nail.As opinion polls demonstrate, Nicola Sturgeon’s options outlook, chimes with voters. A Panelbase survey has found most Scots favour staying in the UK by  per cent to  per cent but the proportions precisely reversethere’s a no-deal Brexit – and in such a scenario  per cent believe independence would be better for Scotland. Evidently voters are quite capable of weighing and comparing possible futures. They just need a deadline, more detail, evidence and more control in shaping those options.That can happen.Just one man in a packed conference hall opposed the creation of a citizens’ assembly, unexpectedly announced by Nicola Sturgeon, to decide what kind of independent country Scotland can become, to overcome challenges like Brexit and to determine what further work’s needed so voters can make informed choices. The concept of citizens assemblies – championed by Joanna Cherry MP - may be unfamiliar in Scotland but in Ireland it’s been nothing short of revolutionary, finding popular solutions to previously intractable issues like abortion and conferring upon them a sense of civic legitimacy that’s generally missing in the formal political arena. In Ireland randomly chosen votersmet together over five weekends to hear evidence from experts, politicians and citizens, considered and questioned what they’d heard and finally produced recommendations to the Irish Parliament. That formed a solid basis for the referendum eventually held and won in July . Citizens could do what politicians dared not – they dropped the red lines, reconsidered in light of evidence, found common cause and brought a wealth of erse le experience to the assembly process.In Canada, inidual members of their citizens assembly were paid to cover caring responsibilities and lost work and resourced to hold local meetings hoovering up issues  questions. As Edinburgh academic Oliver Escobar explained at a conference fringe meeting, this helped them become “trusted proxies” in the eyes of other voters. Since the public sessions were live-streamed and covered in regular broadcast updates, that wider electorate stayed involved. Some critics of the citizens assembly fear it undermines “proper” representative democracy. But the countries most likely to use it are amongst the best-ing democracies in the world. Others worry that giving complete decision-making power to a small group of voters might result in disasterthey don’t endorse the “right” result. That’s true. It is a political risk. But the capacity to bestow high levels of trust on fellow citizens is generally rewarded with a responsible approach and an openness to new information. And of course, the assembly’s job is simply to present a set of suggestions – the final decisions are taken, as always, by democratically elected parliaments.If it can be done in Ireland, Australia, Canada and Belgium, it can be done here in Scotland. There’s never been a better time.Political parties across Europe are failing to represent the new fault-lines in society. Instead, old priorities are being offered … and rejected, as the SNP leadership discovered this weekend after conference delegates voted to adopt a new Scottish currency “as soon as practicable after Independence Day” instead of waiting until the end of the first post-independence Parliament.The party leadership maintains the controversial six tests will stay because the successful amendment didn’t delete them and others which did, failed to pass. But no-one in the hall could be in any doubt about the intent of proposer Timothy Rideout who was fairly scathing in his criticism. Not a single ordinary delegate spoke for the leadership’s position, not a single MP or MSP was called to speak for an amendment. This was absolutely a case of the grassroots challenging the leadership – but it did not come from nowhere. Essentially delegates were simply keeping faith with the party’s National Assembly process last summer during which three separate gatherings heard the evidence and then rejected long-term use of the pound or sterlingisation after independence – three times. That was a warning the leadership failed to heed.Which is where citizens assemblies come in. The SNP and indeed the wider Yes movement cannot afford further mismatches between pre-existing policy and popular opinion. As the First Minister herself put it, the independence campaign must go “beyond tribes.” So the daring thing for Nicola Sturgeon would be to waste no time and get on with a citizens assembly, starting the mechanisms of selection, organisation and facilitation, holding the first assembly this summer and giving it a meaty issue to cut its teeth on – something like the currency in an independent Scotland or restoring genuinely local democracy in a country with the largest councils in the developed world. There’s total paralysis everywhere  in Britain and despite the high drama of the European elections south of the border as Farage’s Brexit Party pulverises the Tories and the pantomime of Donald Trump’s state visit, that isn’t going to change.

But with the upper bunk down and two people sharing, I suspect space will feel just as tight as before.Maybe I was just unlucky, but the air conditioning didn’t cool the cabin until late into the night, despite being turned to its lowest.

Almost  of their cadets received a total of  certicates of qualication, and promotion in rank earned within the last  months.

Mrs Christie was thanked for her own dedication to the cadet forces in Co Antrim during her time in position, and was wished a very happy retirement for when she finishes in June.

Chairperson Ruth Verner commented: “The hard work and dedication our cadets show is a credit to them, and we are very proud to have them in our unit. “Many of the qualications earned have meant the cadets had to go away for weekends to complete the courses, and when they are at school all week their weekends are precious, so to willingly give up the time to improve their skills is admirable. “We are also pleased to have built relationships with the Army Cadet Forces and look forward to continuing to work together to help and improve our local communities.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Since the family’s ‘Is Deontóir Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July , it has since been reportedthat an increase of four percent of people in the north have opted onto the organ donation register. Dáithí’s parents Máirtín and Seph told the Andersonstown News how delighted they were to learn of the news and that their visit to London for the event in September will coincide with the toddler’s third birthday. “The British Heart Foundation run their annual Heart Hero award every year,” explained Seph.“Máirtín put in the application for it, it was basically a , word essay and we got an email the other day saying that Dáithí had been shortlisted to the last three. “The event is going to be held in the Globe Theatre in London, we are so over the moon, we can’t believe it,” she said. Seph and Máirtín also spoke of how their campaign has taken striking visual awareness with the addition of Dáithí’s pink Is Deontóir Mé slogan and picture emblazoned on a black taxi.“To see the logo on the taxi fills us with so much pride, everyone is going to see it on the road and evenit makes somebody stop and turn around, maybe think twice about organ donation for a wee second, it makes all the dference.”Máirtín added: “I can’t really put it into words how happy we are to find out that Dáithí has been shortlisted for the Heart Hero award. We have sparked up a great relationship with the British Heart Foundation for a couple of months now. They do absolutely unbelievable work that will benefit Dáithí and people like Dáithí, they also work on the promotion of organ donation as well.“In these very hard times, to hear that Dáithí is worthy of this award is great for us. “We are really looking forward to going back to London as Dáithi’s hospital is not that far from where we are going to be – not that we were looking to go into an ICU ward but we can’t wait to bring Dáithí in. The last time the staff saw him he was such a tiny baby, his chest was open, they were preparing us for the worst. Dáithi is turning three when we are over and we can’t wait to show him off to all the doctors and nurses who saved his le.”“Being from West Belfast, I’ve used black taxis all my le, five times a week, twice a day, all my le. To know we have my son on the taxi in bright pink is brilliant, everytime we see the taxi we cheer, Daithí shouts out the car window ‘meeeeeeeeeee’. We want to thank driver Micky Russell for helping us to create awareness, it looks class, we are delighted,” he said.Micky added: “There are only two things you can see from space, the Great Wall of China and my taxi,” he laughed. “It’s an absolute privilege to have the wrap around on the taxi, to create that visual awareness. The taxi is up and down the road, the Shankill, I’ve tourists in the taxi as well, they would ask ‘why the colour ’ I can say to them about organ donation and Dáithí.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"julie file locked for 45","story":"THE sister of a -year-old Lenadoon girl killed by aplastic bullet in  has hit out a decision to lock the National Archives file on her death for another  years. Julie Livingstone was ing from a local shop on the Stewartstown Road when she was fatally injured by a plastic bullet on , May . The round, which was fired from a British Army vehicle, struck her on the head and she died the next day. Earlier this week, researchers at the Pat Finucane Centre in Derry revealed that files held at the National Archives in Kew, London, relating to Julie’s death are to be kept closed until . Earlier this week it was reported that a further file relating to the plastic bullet death of a child has been locked for decades. -year-old Paul Whitters, who died on April , ,  days after being struck in the head with a plastic bullet fired by the RUC in Derry, has been closed until .It is extremely unusual for inidual files to be held on people killed in the conflict – the fact that these two files relate to schoolchildren has raised questions about why their deaths have been given such attention and what facts lie within the files that the British government wants to hide. The Northern Ireland office has said the files have been closed “in the interest of national security”. Reacting to the discovery, Julie’s sister, Elizabeth Livingstone, said that justice had been withheld from her family “for long enough”.“None of us – my brothers or sisters – are going to be alive by the time the file is opened again,it ever is,” she said. “Our parents have already passed away and nobody who ever knew Julie will be alive by then. What could possibly be pertinent to a -year-old’s death – a child’s death – that needs to be kept a secret  What is it that we’re not allowed to know about our sister’s death  We had to go through three inquests to clear Julie’s name. Ultimately, Julie was found to be an innocent victim, but that was after several years of us struggling to get a fair inquest. We already thought that justice had been withheld from us for long enough.”She continued: “It’s not a case of ‘Are they hiding something ’ This is about what’s being hidden. It’s obviously something that would prove to be an embarrassment to the British government and the NIO. Our Julie was a -year-old innocent victim. She was going about her own business when she was shot in the head and murdered. What could they possibly not want us to know about it  Your imagination runs wild. The only thing we could do for her was to get justice and now this has happened.”Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described the decision to close the files as “perverse”.“The decision to close Julie’s file until  was made earlier this year,” he explained. “There’s another file on plastic bullets in general, which is closed until  and it beggars belief. I have never seen anything like this before. We see lots of files closed for a long time, but these two files on the deaths of children who were killed by plastic bullets, one by the British Army, one by the RUC.” He added: “There is a total culture of secrecy within the NIO, within Ministry of Defence, and from all of those who want to protect the reputation of RUC and the British Army. They don’t want this information to come out, but it will come out. I’m confident that this file will not be closed until .”The Livingstone family have since written to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to request a meeting about the NIO’s decision. Relatives for Justice CEO, Mark Thompson, called on Ms Bradley to order the release of the files.“Julie was  years of age when she was killed by a plastic bullet in ,” he said. “Her father Archie travelled these islands and Europe telling the world what happened to his baby girl. Along with the other families and injured in the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets, he wanted to make a positive dference, to shine a light of truth and justice in the face of the horror his and other families endured. All families who have experienced state violence know that the British government will go to any s to protect its own interest. This strategic policy of impunity for the killing of Irish children clearly extends even to librarians and archives keepers. They too are complicit in the policies that accompany British state violence. This decision, undoubtedly made under direction, was made while families are asked to engage in a consultation on dealing with the past. This discovery points to the bad faith behind this consultation, as well as displaying the callous indference of those responsible. The least Karen Bradley can do now is meet with the families of Julie Livingstone and Paul Whitters. The very least the keeper of the archives can do under Bradley’s instruction is give the families these files.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcnally major not enough for antrim minors","story":"Electric Ireland Ulster Minor Football Championship quarter-final Antrim -Monaghan -From Paddy Tierney at Corrigan Park MONAGHAN escaped Corrigan Park with a narrow one-point win on Saturday evening in a low-scoring encounter played in extremely gusty conditions – but Antrim manager Collie McAllister insists his side restored pride in the jersey.When the sides met in the Jim McGuigan Cup earlier this month, Monaghan claimed an emphatic -point win at Dunsilly and went on to contest the Ulster Minor League final against Tyrone.On Saturday, however, an injury-time goal from Antrim midfielder Joe McNally left the minimum between the sides after Monaghan had been reduced to  players, but there wasn’t time for the Saffrons to salvage a draw.“I think we put a wee bit of pride back in the jersey,” stated McAllister after the game.“We were playing the Ulster champions and they were cheering going off the pitch.“Monaghan conceded a lot of fouls – that’s craft. They’ve been to an All-Ireland semi-final and they know when to stop the game and they have a few marquee players. I thought our boys matched them. We were under the cosh at times, but our boys showed desire and pride too. The conditions were dficult and we saw some of the shots and passes out there – the game was probably lucky to be played, but the surface was fine.”The teams were closely matched for the first  minutes with Antrim’s Paudie McLaughlin cancelling out an early Liam McDonald free for Monaghan.However, the hosts were dealt a blow when full-back Emmett Irvine, who had impressed in the early stages, picked up a black card after  minutes and the Farneymen assumed control for the remainder of the half with scores from Jason Irwin, Darragh Dempseyand McDonaldputting them - to - ahead at the break.Antrim’s second and final point arrived via a well-taken effort from Daniel McNicholl while Irwin landed his second of the evening on  minutes.Yet, the Monaghan captain, booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow for a high tackle moments later and the visitors were guilty of some cynical fouling as they looked to preserve their lead.Another Dempsey free moved them four clear inside the final  minutes and they looked to have done enough to seal victory.Antrim’s Ryan Lennon was black-carded for a third-man tackle, but a clever pass across the face of goal in stoppage time from Reuben Carleton allowed McNally to palm the ball past Joe Kirk in the Monaghan goal.Monaghan corner-forward McDonald was issued with a straight red for a strike while Antrim didn’t have time to muster a late equaliser.McAllister’s men must quickly regroup for the Qualiers as they will face Armagh in the Athletic Grounds on Saturday afternoon.ANTRIM: J Rodgers R Carleton, E Irvine, M Ferris R Hagan, E Higgins, S O’Callaghan J McNally -, D McNicholl - R McKillop, S Madden, C Higgins P McLaughlin -, R Lennon, R Boyle.Subs: C Killough for Irvine , M Lynch for Higgins .

They are the crossing at Ormeau Road and St John’s Avenue, the intersection of Knock Eden Park and Knockbreda Road, the entrance to Cherryvale Playing Fields and outside the Good Shepherd Church. I was delighted to be able to update the community face-to-face at the inaugural ‘Empowerment through engagement’ public meeting in the newly-built Good Shepherd Parish Centre. We took those present through the criteria obtained from the Department for Infrastructure for each of the locations. There followed a very constructive conversation with the local stakeholders present. The residents, school, youth and sporting organisation leaders all had ideas about how we could work together to build a profile to meet the department’s requirements, thus speeding up progress and change. We then arranged a face-to-face meeting between the stakeholders and the department. We voiced our concerns, including the fact that, at no time in the assessment process for new crossings, was there a public consultation.Such was the success of the meeting that arrangements were made for a second meeting on mental health, an interactive session with the superb local organisations Aware, Inspire and PIPS. Each of these bodies showcased what they do and how we can improve mental wellbeing in our area. Again, the focus was on introducing the local community to important organisations who can help us to access better services. One of the most pleasant effects of the meetings is the frequency of inquiries from constituents about the next meeting. An inquisitive community is an empowered community. I am delighted to confirm that the next meeting is on local history and will take place in May."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38047661.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/patch.jpg","title":"get ready for the transfer tests with the belfast telegraph and transfertests co uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"simon coveney we were utterly powerless to comfort a mother who told us she had lost her baby","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you open a calendar on any given week you will find a reason for politicians to hold off engaging with each other..pushMarching season, conference season, elections, pressure in Westminster, negotiations in Brussels and issues within inidual parties are just a few examples.Little more than a week ago the usual script had been written, and was widely accepted, for the weeks ahead.Politicians in Westminster, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast were taking an Easter break in the assumption that there could be no engagement while local and European election campaigns were being fought in Northern Ireland in May. The script said the parties were on the doorsteps and would inevitably maintain partisan politics until the elections had past.Just after pm on Thursday April  that script was torn up by the senseless and heartbreaking murder of a woman whose name we have all come to know, Lyra McKee, whom, by the outstanding tributes of her partner, family and friends, we all wish we had known in le.As a politician and Tanaiste there are many things you experience that are unique but there are only a handful of experiences that you know will stay with you until the end of your days.Being in the front pews of St Annes Cathedral as an unstoppable wave of applause, hope and demand hit the most senior politicians from the UK and Ireland in the base of our spines is one such moment I will never forget.The words of Father Martin Magill summed up the desire and frustration of all communities in Northern Ireland in a sentence,\"Why in Gods name does it take the death of the -year old woman, with her whole le in front of her, to get to this point \"Last summer violence in Derry saw live bullets being fired and police officers narrowly escaping injury or death. In January seven young people were minutes from being killed after they passed the car bomb that sat in the centre of Derry. However, on April  the cowards claimed a victim. The fact that it was a journalist and writer who was a shining example of everything Northern Ireland can achieve is the reason so many people have come together to mourn.The night before Lyra McKees funeral I sat in Strand Road police station in Derry with the officers who had tried to save her le. These men and women are hardened by the fact that petrol bombs can be thrown at them in the course of their everyday work but on Tuesday night they were numbed and vulnerable at the fact that a young woman had died beside them. Despite their Land Rovers being alight with petrol and live ammunition being fired at them, the PSNI left its secure position to get to Lyra McKee after she had been hit. They made the decision to drive to Altnagelvin Hospital, officers performed CPR on Lyra for the entire journey and they stayed and supported her partner and friends as the horrible news of her death was confirmed. The leadership shown by the PSNI in Derry has rightly been applauded by the community it serves.While I heard Father Magills rallying call for political leadership loud and clear, I also heard what he said about the events in Derry as the news of Lyras murder sunk in: \"I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday.\"Arlene Foster, Michelle ONeill, Colum Eastwood, Robin Swann and Naomi Long were not ordered to release a joint statement by anyone or told to go into the Creggan. When a dark moment threatened to drag Northern Ireland back to a dark past their natural inclination was to do the right thing.We now have a window where the Irish and British Governments are calling the parties together. We have all spoken in person and on the phone many times in the last week and without exception I believe all the party leaders are genuine in their desire toto Stormont.As we meet in the weeks ahead, a conversation I had with Mrs Joan McKee will be foremost in my mind.Standing in the side chapel of St Annes was the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as well as myself as Tanaiste, the Secretary of State and ministers of both governments. Despite all the power of those elected offices we were standing there as a group that was utterly powerless to comfort a woman who had, as Joan put it, \"lost her baby\".We owe it to Joan and Lyra McKee to make sure no other ceasefire babies are murdered in the prime of their lives and to make sure that Northern Ireland has a ing government.There is never a perfect time to do the right thing in Northern Ireland.

We want powersharing and we need both governments to back powersharing - @MaryLouMcDonald tells media at Stormont pic xTICbXDmGl— Sinn FéinApril , Efforts to resolve the political impasse have been injected with fresh impetus following the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, , by dissident republicans in Londonderry earlier this month.The last DUP Sinn Fein-led powersharing coalition imploded in January  amid a row about a botched renewable energy scheme.The rt between the erstwhile partners-in-government subsequently widen to take in disputes over the Irish language, same sex marriage and the legacy of the Troubles.On Monday, Mrs McDonald said: “We will enter these talks in good heart, in good faith, we will make every effort to arrive at a conclusion but, in the event that we cannot conclude on what are equality issues for citizens, then be very, very clear that the two government as co-guarantors and signatories of the Good Friday Agreement will have to, at that stage, intervene.“Because time has run out on equality, time has run out on this stalemate, it’s not good enough.

Leadership is needed right across our public services. The only way for this to happen is to have ministers back at their desks working on the issues which matter to everyone.”The last ill-fated talks process broke down last February in acrimony amid claim and counter claim on what had actually been agreed. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley announced a fresh bid to restore Stormont powersharing Sinn Fein said DUP leader Arlene Foster had agreed a draft deal to re-enter devolved government – a claim Mrs Foster emphatically denied.Leaked copies of papers exchanged between the parties indicated discussions included a three-stranded legislative approach to deal with the key logjam over Irish language protections.Last month, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said her party would not “negotiate down” from the February  position.On Monday, Mrs McDonald was asked would she countenance a deal that looked signicantly dferent to that disputed text.She replied by saying any agreement had to be “anchored in the values of equality and respect”.“This is not about one-upmanship or one-upwomanship – this is about decency, this is about doing the right thing,” the republican leader added.“This is about acknowledging our people, all of them, and that is the only sustainable basis for good government.”The Sinn Fein leader said the talks needed to be substantive.“We have to avoid at all costs the danger of simply talking for talks’ sake,” she said.“We don’t need box-ticking exercises. We don’t need anything that is superficial or a matter of spin.”She added: “We are ready to do the business, we are ready for positivity, we are ready for dialogue and engagement, and, above all, we are now ready for solutions, because stalemate is not an option into the future.”Mrs McDonald said the talks represented a “big opportunity” to resolve the outstanding issues at the heart of the logjam.“We have an opportunity to establish real, genuine powersharing institutions that serve every one of our citizens,” she added.“We have the opportunity to move to a new dispensation where no section of our community and no citizen is left behind.“We hope that others – the two governments and all the political parties – will seize this opportunity.”Mr Dodds highlighted the £ billion in investment delivered to Northern Ireland through the DUP’s confidence and supply Westminster deal with the Conservative Party.But he said much more could have been achieved in the past two yearsthe executive had been running.“The DUP will not be found wanting in any talks process but our preference would have been to have talks in parallel with the restoration of a devolved government,” he said.“The previous executive had a cross-party agreement for reforming our hospitals, yet it is sitting on the shelf gathering dust. The Assembly and executive should be restored immediately so work on the issues which matter to everyone can be progressed alongside talks to resolve the areas where there is contention. “Whilst Sinn Fein focus on narrow sectional interests, the DUP has been able to deliver £ billion more for schools, hospitals and roads yet we could have achieved so much morewe had a ing executive. “Having a fully restored Assembly and our influence in London would enable more delivery for everyone in Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"get a sense of humour dup man blasts sinn fein over burning leaflet facebook post criticism","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We agree that what is now needed is actions and not just words from all of us who are in positions of leadership.“We have agreed to establish a new process of political talks, involving all the main political parties in Northern Ireland, together with the UK and Irish Governments, in accordance with the three stranded process.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic. The queue management was very good, I was down the street on Sunday and Monday and it was moving well.The Department of Infrastructure was unable to provide a response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch U","story":"BALLYMACARN Park was bathed in sunshine as the talented lsquoHinch U- squad battled with Virginia for a place in the showpiece Ulster Carpets Cup final at Kingspan Stadium.Despite the heat, both sides put on an excellent display of running rugby in an entertaining encounter with Virginia drawing first blood, taking advantage of an uncharacteristically passive lsquoHinch defence to score from deep with their first attack.lsquoHinch began to work their patterns and took the lead with a typically powerful carry and score from Morgan Croskery and a fine finish from Jojo Naga.Virginia battled back and spent the final minutes before half time battering the lsquoHinch line.Fine close quarter defence enabled the home side to clear their lines but more sloppy defending from the backs allowed Virginia to gain territory and they scored to leave the tie evenly poised at -all.During the half-time break the lsquoHinch coaches asked for more urgency in defence and better ball protection in attack and were rewarded with a superb  minutes of rugby from their side.A line out move was executed perfectly for Matthew Torney to pop up a short pass for a charging Croskery to steam onto the ball and over the line untouched.The home forwards then bullied their opponents in consecutive mauls and Torney used all his power to help himself to a typical close-range score as the Virginia forwards tired.Any thoughts of a comeback were derailed by much improved line speed in defence as Cameron Patterson led the line superbly, driving his man back behind the gain line repeatedly and galvanising his team.James McMaster and Luke Braithwaite were also busy, using their power to disrupt attacks and win turnovers.A Croskery sin-bin was easily absorbed and when Naga finished an excellent Dan Hewitt chip ahead to give his team a  point lead, the match was effectively over as a contest.lsquoHinch emptied their bench to give everyone some time on the pitch and the game lost a little of its intensity as it entered the final  minutes.To their credit, Virginia battled up field for a consolation score with the last move of the match to leave the final score -.League champions, City of Armagh, await the local boys in the final on May  at Kingspan Stadium on what will be a great occasion for this dedicated group of players.Their quarter-final exit from the league play-offs did not do them justice and they have regrouped well over the past few weeks to put together an excellent cup campaign.Hooker Harry McCarroll epitomised the work ethic on Saturday with an all-action man of the match display and senior players continue to set the standards as the season reaches a conclusion.All support welcome on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac recognised with two accolades  ","story":"A STUDENT and upcoming politician at Downpatrickrsquos St Patrickrsquos Grammar School recently won two prestigious awards in consecutive days.Cormac Savagereceived the awards for his work in the local community, including engaging young people in politics and for his efforts with local charities like the Mid Down MS Support Group.Cormac mdash who is currently a Member of the Youth Parliament representing South Down mdash was nominated for a Michaela Foundation Wings Award and a Youth and Future Talent Awardin the inspirational young person category by St Patrickrsquos Grammarrsquos head of music, Celeste McEvoy.Cormac delivered a rousing speech last November in the House of Commons with the UK Youth Parliament about the topic of homelessness and, in particular, its gender impact on safety.Also late last year, Cormac gave , local young people the chance to have their voices heard about which issues are most important to them as part of the lsquoMake Your Markrsquo campaign.His first accolade came through The Wings Awards run by the Michaela Foundation in memory of Michaela McAreavey, the young bride murdered on honeymoon in Mauritius in .Cormac said he felt ldquooverwhelmed to have won one of the four awards in the age - category with  young people shortlisted.The awards, set up by Michaelarsquos husband John and her father, Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, seek to recognise young people who have been ldquomotivators within their local community.The following night, Cormac was recognised as an lsquoinspirational young person at the YAFTA awards run by Newry and Mourne Youth Council and Down Area Youth Council.Cormac said the whole experience felt ldquosurreal, adding that it was a ldquototal honour.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening.

Who’s going to do it “And that’s not the biggest problem. What bank is going to lend money to anybody ...on the strength of a renewable payment going forward when they have done this backward step with RHI ”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the

Katie Herron and Rebekah Lennon, NI schools champions with Seagoe PSHaving become the club NI champions with Portadown for the second successive year, the girls did the double last Wednesday when they won the NI schools final with Seagoe Primary School.Rebekah said: “We’ve always been best friends and we’ve always played hockey together at school. I used to play at Lurgan and then I moved to Portadown in P.“My two older sisters both played and my dad was coaching so that’s how I got into hockey.”Rebekah, who also enjoys playing volleyball, said: “I’m hoping to play hockey for Ireland and Ulster.”Katie, like Rebekah, has set herself the goal of making the Irish hockey team.Katie, who also plays football for Linfield and the Northern Ireland development squad, said: “I really hope that Rebekah and I will stay in the same team right the way through until Ireland. Rebekah plays in centre midfield and I play on the wing, we’d pass the ball to each other a lot.”Katie’s mum Jenner said: “From the age of four I’ve never known them to have a fall out or a major argument.“They have so much in common with each other – their lives are so busy, they bounce off each other and learn stuff off each other.”She added: “The hours of training Katie puts into both sports make it worth it, especially getting the double – it’s just amazing and all in a few days of each other.”Rebekah’s dad Ivor, a hockey coach, said: “Rebekah developed her strength and stability at Lurgan Boys’ Hockey Club where she was playing against -year-old boys when she was nine.” He added: “Katie’s a fantastic player.

Ulster-Scots Agency has said he hopes a new multi-million euro #peace campus# in Co Monaghan will herald the beginning of greater levels of support in the border region.A launch event for the new €.million Peace Campus was held today, just days after Monaghan County Council issued a tender for its construction.The new campus – funded to the tune of €. million by the EU’s Peace IV programme – is designed specically to support and encourage cross-community engagement.The Ulster-Scots Agency has supported the council in its funding bid.Speaking after the launch event, the agency’s chief executive Ian Crozier said: “The peace campus project will provide valuable shared space for the entire community in Co Monaghan.“Importantly, however, it will also provide a dedicated space where the story of the minority Ulster-Scots community will be told.“This will be the first time that Ulster-Scots identity will be recognised and celebrated in a public building in the Irish Republic.”Mr Crozier added: “We hope that this important milestone will be the foundation for much greater levels of support for the Ulster-Scots community in the Monaghan Cavan border region and we look forward to working with Monaghan County Council to make it a reality.”Eamonn O’Sullivan, chief executive of Monaghan County Council, said: “This project has been three years in the making and has seen new relationships formed with the Orange Order, Ulster-Scots Agency, and Muineachán Le Gaeilge, the first time this has happened in a Peace Programme in Co Monaghan.”Ex-police tell Ballymurphy inquest of

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/stats_r1.jpg","title":"statsports takes on premier leagues alex oxlade chamberlain and raheem sterling","story":"Posted on Thursday  April  by Ulster Business Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and chief global strategist Jarlath Quinn Newry firm STATSports have taken on board Premier League players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling as signicant investors as well as global ambassadors for the burgeoning tech firm.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive.
