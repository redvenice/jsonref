Only today, she’s launched a fresh attack, spewing away about her ‘right’ to trash talk Meghan.  On the left we have the drunken, violent, drug-addled, estranged half-brother Thomas Jr., who wrote a letter to Harry demanding he dump his ‘narcissistic, shallow, selfish’ sister.  On the right is the bitter, twisted and equally estranged half-sister Samantha spitting cruel bile.

Meghan Markle\u0027s mother...Meghan\u0027s best friend touches down in London: Fashion queen...Share this articleAnd now we’ve had the father of the bride caught with his greedy snout in the paparazzi trough, cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.As best-selling romantic novelist Lisa Kleypas said: ‘Weddings are never about the bride and groom, weddings are public platforms for dysfunctional families.’I just never thought the day would come when a family marrying INTO the royal family would be more dysfunctional than the royal family itself.But here we are.Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle.There’s absolutely no excuse for what he did in taking money from a paparazzo to stage those photos.Not least because in doing so, he made Kensington Palace look utterly ridiculous.          The father of the bride has been caught cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.  Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle, who doubled down on his idiocyPrince Harry’s own communications director sent out stern warnings to the media ordering them to back off Thomas Markle after seeing the photos and wrongly assuming he’d been the victim of a cruel invasion of privacy.In fact, Mr Markle was invading his own privacy – for a big fat cheque.Now, you might think he’d have learned his lesson, kept his head down and tried to rescue the last remnants of his dignity – if only for the sake of his poor daughter.And you would be wrong…Instead, Mr Markle’s doubled down on his idiocy.Since the Mail on Sunday exposed his cringe-making sham, he’s been sharing his thoughts on an almost hourly basis with TMZ – a fine showbiz website, but not previously noted for their expertise on the inner workings of British royalty. First, he told them he was mortified by the embarrassment of the story.Then he claimed he’d had a heart attack last week, so wouldn’t be attending the wedding.Yesterday, Mr Markle was back with more exclusives he’d changed his mind and wanted to be at the ‘historic’ wedding.Then, last night, he told TMZ he now needed urgent heart surgery, so wouldn’t be able to go after all.TMZ, perfectly understandably, has splashed these juicy revelations across its site and generated huge clicks and attention for itself in the process.          Now Mr Markle has been sharing his thoughts with TMZ. They have understandably splashed these juicy revelations across the site and generated huge clicks and attention. Kudos to TMZ. But why is Thomas Markle continuing to collude with tabloid reporters - and what the hell is Kensington Palace playing at in letting him?As a former tabloid editor, I commend their brilliant news-breaking journalism. They’ve got the whole world waiting with bated breath for details of their next conversation with Meghan’s dad.But also as a former tabloid editor, I am utterly incredulous as to why Thomas Markle is continuing to collude with tabloid reporters?And I’m even more incredulous as to what the hell Kensington Palace is playing at in letting him?The Palace staff has completely and shamefully lost control of the narrative of this wedding.From the moment it was announced, they should have taken immediate steps to ensure Meghan’s family were protected from the inevitable massive media attention heading their way.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that when a handsome British Prince marries a beautiful American actress, global press interest is going to be off the charts.Yet Thomas Markle, currently the world’s most famous father-of-the-bride, has been left to fend for himself 8000 miles away.So he’s made his own decisions as to how to handle the media, aided and abetted by his ghastly daughter Samantha, and they have turned out disastrously.Why on earth didn’t Kensington Palace either send people to Mexico to advise him, or fly Mr Markle to London? It’s not as if Harry and Meghan can’t afford to put him up for a few weeks – they’re both rich and live in a giant palace full of spare rooms and servants.(Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that? And now won’t be able to at all before he makes the poor man’s daughter his wife.)          Why didn’t Kensington Palace send people to Mexico to advise him or fly Mr Markle to London? Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that?The result of this farcical incompetence is that Meghan’s had to spend the most stressful week of her life with a hundred times more stress than she could have ever imagined.I imagine she’s been utterly distraught at her father’s conduct.There have been reports of her tearfully begging him on the phone to change his mind and walk her down the aisle.What a terrible situation for any bride to find herself in.I also imagine that Harry’s been utterly furious.For someone who hates the paparazzi and tabloids to see his soon-to-be father-in-law in cahoots with the paparazzi and tabloids will have enraged the headstrong young Prince beyond belief.On the other hand he might reflect that if he and his big brother hadn’t been so controlling and privacy obsessed, constantly warning the press not to ‘intrude’ on Meghan’s family then Mr Markle’s collusion with said press would never have been so embarrassing. This will be his, and the Palace’s worst nightmare: a major player in the biggest day of his life going rogue.Perhaps things will sort themselves out by Saturday but I doubt it.From the sound of things, the only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum.          The only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum. She\u0027s seen here leaving for the airport, alone That fact alone would fill me with deep concern if I were the royals. Who ARE these Markles?What further mayhem are they going to wreak, especially now they’ve all been snubbed from the wedding?Hell, as we’ve already seen, hath no fury like an estranged relative scorned.I don’t think Harry and Meghan can escape some blame here.By excluding from their 600-strong guest-list all of Meghan’s family – many of whom have only said nice things about her and the wedding - and some of her oldest friends, they’re surely creating an even bigger problem down the road?Sometimes, a wedding is a good chance to settle old grievances, rather than cement them.They’re now going to have a lot more disgruntled Markles bristling with anger at being snubbed, especially when they see celebrities like the Beckhams sitting in ‘their’ seats in the church.So the Markle reality show will roll un-edifyingly on, and the Palace appears worryingly impotent and incompetent in its efforts to control the tidal wave of tacky titillation cascading from their lips.As for how all this washes up, my heart hopes Harry and Meghan will brush off the wedding chaos and live the fairy-tale happily ever after. My head, though, views with mounting concern the wildly erratic behaviour of the Markles, and I find myself murmuring: ‘There may be trouble ahead….’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/14/4C505A5C00000578-5736037-image-m-2_1526478895759.jpg","title":"TV star Ben Fogle conquers Mount Everest","story":"    \u0027At 7.30am on the 16th April, after more than five weeks of acclimatising and training on Mount Everest, I finally realised a childhood dream when I successfully summited the 8848m mountain,\u0027 Ben Fogle wrote as he shared this photo of him atop Mount EverestFogle and his wife Marina, who already have two children, Luca, eight and Iona, six, were left heartbroken after their younger son was delivered stillborn at 32 weeks in 2014. The star, 44,  said the death made him \u0027re-evaluate life\u0027 and ensure he was living \u0027for the now.\u0027Posting on Instagram, he said: \u0027There is one person in particular for whom this journey is dedicated.

Meghan\u0027s father (pictured with her) may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?The cast of characters in the Markle chamber of horrors includes a cannabis farmer, a Domino\u0027s Manager, a recovering alcoholic and the spiteful half-sister she no longer appears to speak to.Not forgetting the \u0027intensely private\u0027 bankrupt dad who changes his story from day to day.The former lighting director may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?For once, the characters and their stories outperform anything soaps could dream up - this is beyond satire.Meghan has my sympathy, because every one of us has ghastly relatives, family members we\u0027ve airbrushed out of our lives, people we would never choose as friends, let alone family members.She has the misfortune to be lumbered with a whole coachload.          With ghastly relatives like hers, Meghan will find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dullWeddings always ide as many people in a family as they unite - it\u0027s a chance to settle scores (with restricted guest lists) and create a two-tiered system where some lucky people get gold passes to every part of the day, some are granted silver membership to a few drinks and a sausage roll if they\u0027re lucky, or the common plebs who have to make do with a fleeting glimpse from the roadside in dubious weather with no refreshments.The father of any bride is in a difficult position - he will be proud his gorgeous daughter is marrying someone she adores, but fearful he might mess up his pivotal role in the proceedings.At my first wedding, Dad insisted on driving me to Chelsea Register Office. We\u0027d not been speaking for nine months because I\u0027d cancelled my previous engagement.When my parents found out my new husband-to-be was posh - and I would have a double-barreled name, things improved slightly.Like Meghan\u0027s father, my dad blew hot and cold, but in the end he drove me to the ceremony.I was wearing a beautiful dress, but as I stepped out of the car, he was so nervous he slammed the door on my leg and we had a furious row in the street.At lunch in a fashionable restaurant afterwards, my mother tried to steal the flowers.The manager had to present her with them and I have a picture of her in the car park hoisting her trophies aloft. I died with embarrassment.Meghan has wisely not invited the motley crew of Markles, and why should she?I didn\u0027t invite any of my cousins and only one aunt and uncle.Meghan\u0027s lot could hardly be equipped for small talk with Princess Anne or Prince Edward - I can\u0027t imagine they know anything about equine blood lines or musical theatre, although her nephew TJ Dooley junior (married to husband Ronnie) has been photographed in drag, clutching his fake breasts.His brother Tyler (a cannabis farmer) is producing a new strain to celebrate the occasion- Markle Sparkle, retailing at over $200 an ounce.Their dad - Meghan\u0027s half brother - a glass fitter also called Thomas, has not flown to the UK, but posted offensive remarks about Meghan when he discovered he was not on the Windsor guest list.Meghan\u0027s half sister Samantha Grant has been blabbing to anyone who contacts her (for cash of course), claiming that it was her idea to set up their confused and well meaning father with a paparazzi photographer, although she couldn\u0027t be sure exactly how much he got paid.Samantha and Meghan allegedly haven\u0027t spoken for over ten years, so her insights on the new member of the Royal family will be a little sketchy.Samantha is publishing a book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister.When I appeared on I\u0027m a Celebrity, my sister flogged pictures from our family album to a gossip magazine.Someone else sold my Brownie pictures.My sister revealed I had tried to kill her when we were 8 and 10.My fourth ex-husband sold his story twice to different tabloids, claiming I was \u0027a beast in bed\u0027.That\u0027s why I have sympathy for Meghan.

The pair met in the city not long after Meghan arrived to film SuitsShe is also credited by many as the brains behind Meghan’s transformation from television actress to polished princess in waiting. It is largely thanks to their flourishing friendship that American-born Meghan, who relocated to Canada while filming the television series Suits, found herself moving through the kind of high-powered social circles that ultimately led her to Harry’s side.Meghan and Jessica are now so close that it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. Dark-haired elegant — and extremely well-married — Jessica could indeed pass as Meghan Mark II.Not for nothing is Mulroney known as the ‘Gwyneth Paltrow of Toronto’. Born into Canada’s wealthy Browns shoes dynasty, a family empire worth a reported £50 million, the privately educated heiress is married to Ben Mulroney, son of the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — and firm friends with the wife of the current one.      She apparently enjoys the kind of glamorous lifestyle that could have come straight out of the pages of a glossy magazine, and is regarded as the closest thing to royalty in that country.Every facet of her enviable life is shared on the social media sharing site Instagram — from her three beautiful children, to her impressive exercise routine and elegant social life. And, of course, her friendship with Meghan.Certainly, it is hard to see how Harry’s fiancee would have made it into the Canadian A-list without this female powerhouse.They met in 2011, not long after Meghan arrived in Toronto where Suits was filmed.The Mail understands that Meghan initially employed Mulroney as a fashion stylist after she shot to fame as ambitious paralegal Rachel Zane. The pair bonded over their love of yoga, dogs, expensive red wine, healthy eating, work-outs and charity work. What began as a professional relationship swiftly turned to a deep and lasting friendship.And before long, Meghan had adopted Mulroney’s sophisticated socialite style.It was under her guidance that, after meeting Prince Harry, Meghan swiftly ditched the racier ensembles she once delighted in wearing and embraced a sophisticated, pared-down chic.Out went the leather skirts and plunging necklines. In came elegant, to-the-knee shift dresses and crisp white shirts.Before too long, it was noted, the two women were wearing their long dark tresses in the same style and were often photographed sporting very similar outfits.When Meghan moved to the UK in the run-up to her engagement to Harry, it was Mulroney who helped her put together a wardrobe of clothes fit for royalty.          Mulroney is an Instagram addict, which she uses to chronicle every facet of her enviable lifeShe was also behind the white wrap coat, green shift dress and nude heels that Meghan wore when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in the gardens of Kensington Palace last autumn.It goes without saying, too, that the dress Meghan wears on Saturday has had the Mulroney seal of approval at every stage of its creation.She is thought to have flown to the UK from Canada at least three times in recent months to oversee key fittings. But, while Jessica is believed to have advised Meghan on everything from the dress to the flowers to the wedding lunch, her family’s invitation to Saturday’s Royal Wedding is about so much more than professional gratitude.The fact that her children, seven-year-old twins Brian and John and five-year-old daughter Ivy, will be among the ten page boys and flower girls who will follow Meghan as she walks up the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor at the weekend is testament to just how close the women have become.At a time when members of her own family, especially her embarrassingly loquacious half-sister Samantha Markle, have let Meghan down over and again, it is Mulroney who has stuck faithfully by her side.Donald and Melania Trump will honor Harry and Meghan with a...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the Markle...Share this articleMeghan — ‘Aunty Meg’ to her friend’s three children — has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’. It was here that the earliest whispers about her burgeoning romance with Harry were shared.Here too, that the Prince and Meghan were able to spend time together away from the glare of publicity that would have undoubtedly blazed down upon them in the UK.But the two women could not have come from more different backgrounds. Meghan’s humble roots lie in Los Angeles where her father Thomas, a former lighting director, was declared bankrupt in 2016.Her mother Doria, who used to work for an airline, is now a yoga teacher and social worker. Her mother’s great-great-grandfather was a freed slave named Wisdom.Jessica, meanwhile, was privately educated at an exclusive girls’ school before going to McGill University where she studied industrial relations and economics.          Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney on holiday in Italy in 2016. Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getawayIn 2007, she married television presenter Benedict Mulroney, whose father Brian was Canada’s Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993.Much of Jessica and Meghan’s friendship has been played out on social media.The early days of their friendship were recorded with plentiful snaps of a holiday in Italy they shared in the summer of 2016.It was clear to anyone who saw the Instagram photographs of the women sunbathing in their bikinis on the deck of a boat, or sipping Negroni cocktails by the pool, that they were inseparable.Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getaway.But, crucially, it was also largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, among them 42-year-old Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, a flamboyant former TV presenter, who is now better known as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Other friends of Mulroney’s who helped pave the road to Harry’s door include Markus Anderson, the suave party-loving business brains behind the opening of the Toronto branch of the ultra-fashionable private members club Soho House — of which Harry is also a member.If ever a sign was needed that Meghan had ‘made it’ in Canadian high society, it was surely the sight of her at the club’s pretty rooftop bar with Sophie Trudeau and Mulroney on a girls’ night out together in 2016.She and Harry are said to have been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend — whose identity they won’t reveal.Before news of the royal romance broke, Jessica and husband Ben, 41, had Meghan and Harry over for several cosy, discreet dinners where they could spend precious time together away from prying eyes. At the closing ceremony of Prince Harry’s Invictus Games last October, where he was seen kissing Meghan in public for the first time, Jessica was one of just two friends selected to join the actress in her private box.          It is largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, putting her on the road to meeting Prince Harry Once Meghan had been catapulted into the social stratosphere, Mulroney happily slipped into the role of Girl Friday, quietly advising and supporting her — but always remaining tight-lipped.The two women enjoyed a foretaste of royal bridal dress planning when Meghan turned to Mulroney for help choosing a wedding gown for her Suits character Rachel Zane — who was stood up at the altar by her on-screen fiance, Mike Ross.On that occasion, Meghan chose an Anne Barge Versailles dress from the Canadian bridal boutique which Mulroney represents as a PR.Mulroney posted a photograph of her friend wearing the dress with the the social media hashtag ‘princess goals’.Meghan, meanwhile, apparently returned the favour by name-dropping her friend during an interview about her on-screen wedding.‘I went through all the options with my dear friend Jessica Mulroney of Kleinfeld Hudson’s Bay in Canada,’ Meghan said.‘I put this one on and it just screamed “Rachel”. It is classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for.’As a bridal expert, of course, Mulroney’s closeness to Meghan and the royals will do her no professional harm.Jessica has, since 2013, done PR for the aforementioned Kleinfeld Bridal, an upmarket Toronto boutique, which as well as selling dreamy designer dresses worth thousands of pounds, also offers £200 lacy lingerie and £300 crystal-embellished headbands.In February this year, she set up an Instagram account devoted to ‘all things bridal and style’, on which she showcases her ideas for wedding day fashion, food and exotic honeymoons. She also posts photographs of grateful brides she’s rehearsed and styled for their big day.          Jessica Mulroney and her children. Meghan is ‘Aunty Meg’ to the children and has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’She’s also guest editor of Wedding Vacations magazine and makes regular appearances as a bridal expert on Canadian daytime TV.Given the attention Meghan’s clothing choices already get, a friend like Mulroney is valuable indeed. She rode to Meghan’s rescue when she was agonising over what to wear to Pippa Middleton’s wedding a year ago.Palace insiders say she wore a simple black dress for the evening do, which Jessica — demonstrating a keen awareness of royal protocol — recommended only after finding out the details of Kate’s outfit, thereby avoiding a clash with her future sister-in-law.‘Jessica is smart enough to know that, as well as making sure Meghan looks her best, they also need to be mindful about what Kate is wearing,’ a source said at the time.Yesterday afternoon, Jessica was spotted hand in hand with her five-year-old daughter Ivy, doing some last-minute shopping in Marks \u0026amp Spencer close to Kensington Palace where the family are thought to be staying.So how will you spot her among the congregation on Saturday? Easy. Look out for a woman with Meghan’s shiny dark hair, dewy skin and impeccable dress sense.

Supporters of Noura Hussein Hammad flocked to the Criminal Court in Omdurman, Sudan\u0027s second-largest city, in protest during the trialAmnesty International, contacted by AFP, confirmed the woman\u0027s conviction and flogging, saying it would follow up the case.A women\u0027s rights activist said she witnessed the flogging.\u0027I was holding her baby in my hands as the ordeal unfolded in front of me,\u0027 said Tahani Abbas, a member of Don\u0027t Oppress Women, a Sudanese NGO.\u0027This was the most painful sight, especially for a women\u0027s rights activist,\u0027 she told AFP.Last Thursday, another court sentenced to death Noura Hussein Hammad for killing a man she had been forced to marry at the age of 16.According to Amnesty, Hammad, now 19, stabbed her husband in self-defence after he raped her. But a court found her guilty of \u0027intentional murder\u0027.Women\u0027s rights activist Amal Habbani condemned Tuesday\u0027s flogging.\u0027The woman was flogged because she married a man of her choice,\u0027 she said.\u0027This shows the condition of Sudanese women. They are oppressed by law.\u0027Activists have stepped up a campaign against forced unions and the marriage of underage girls, a common phenomenon in Sudan where Amnesty says the law allows girls to marry from the age of 10.They say Sudan\u0027s application of Islamic sharia law is often random, and that punishments like flogging women only came into effect since President Omar al-Bashir\u0027s regime took power in a 1989 coup with the backing of Islamists. "},{"url":null,"title":"National Lottery results Lotto draw Wednesday 16th May","story":"Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayWho is Nev Schulman?

On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on Tuesday and has since landed in the UK where she is expected to give her daughter awayShe was driven to Heathrow\u0027s VIP Windsor suite, where Harry\u0027s assistant private secretary Amy Pickerill was waiting with an immigration officer. A member of staff from the private office carried her bags.Miss Ragland, described as a \u0027free spirit\u0027 by her daughter and \u0027amazing\u0027 by Harry, was taken to Kensington Palace where she will stay until Friday.She will not have long to shake off any effects of jet lag. It is thought she will meet the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the next 24 hours.On the night before the wedding she and her daughter will move with the bridal party to historic Cliveden, a 25-minute drive from Windsor Castle.It is widely thought that should her former husband, with whom she is said to be \u0027barely on speaking terms\u0027, fail to show, it will be Miss Ragland who has the task of walking her daughter down the aisle. Some royal insiders have also questioned whether Prince Charles might step in to do the honours.  How Meghan Markle\u0027s estranged family have turned the wedding into a VERY colourful affair Tracey Dooley, 52The recovering alcoholic, who sells advertising was once married to Meghan\u0027s half brother, Thomas Markle Jr.She was pictured arriving at Heathrow with her sons Tyler and Thomas, and are in the UK to conduct a round of interviews - even though she hasn\u0027t seen Meghan for around 20 years. She is documenting her stay in London on a Facebook page \u0027Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles\u0027 where she has uploaded a selection of pictures of famous landmarks.

Now everyone is talking about it on my social networks.\u0027Before retiring, Markle had a glamorous Hollywood career as an Emmy-winning lighting director - something his TV star daughter has cited as an influence in her own acting career.But in Rosarito, he reportedly lived a quiet, solitary life, until unwittingly getting swept into the tumultuous universe of royals and royal-watchers.           Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrived at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle to take staged photos   CCTV captured the staged photo shoot and fitting at Omega internet cafe in Rosarito, MexicoEven now, in this breezy beach town far removed from often dreary England, many have only a vague idea what the fuss is about.\u0027I remember Princess Diana, but I don\u0027t know the slightest thing about her children, least of all this one you\u0027re asking me about,\u0027 said Carolina Solis, a vendor who sells handicrafts near the Omega internet cafe, where Rayner took more staged photos of Markle.\u0027I heard on the American news that Princess Diana\u0027s son\u0027s father-in-law lived here,\u0027 said Andrea Jimenez, a receptionist in a doctor\u0027s office.\u0027I think it\u0027s a good thing for Rosarito. It shows it\u0027s not dangerous like they say, and that famous people come here to relax. It might bring us more tourism.\u0027Markle appears to have suffered for what he later called the \u0027stupid and hammy\u0027 staged photos, which Meghan\u0027s estranged half-sister, Samantha, said were her idea, aimed at polishing his image.After the embarrassing story broke, Markle pulled out of the wedding, then changed his mind again, only to suffer a reported heart attack last week, forcing him to have heart surgery Wednesday.Celebrity news website TMZ reported that the procedure went well but with a lengthy recovery ahead of him, Markle will no longer be able to walk his daughter down the aisle."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/16/4C5A73A100000578-0-image-a-33_1526570997202.jpg","title":"Four bedroom house round tower gives 180 degree estuary views goes sale 675 000","story":"    The well positioned house, built over four levels, has some of the most outstanding views that Kippford has to offer          The unique home offers stunning 180 degree views of one of the UK\u0027s most beautiful stretches of coastline           Braesyde is in a coastal sea front position looking towards the Urr Estuary, surrounding coast, and the farmland beyond          Built over four floors there are four bedrooms, a sun room, living and dining area, garage and an additional summer houseThe four bedroom house, built in 1998, has a guest suite with a full 180 degree expanse of glazing.The owners, waking up in the master suite, have 90 degrees of amazing views to wake up to.Property agents Galbraith have branded the property as having \u0027arguably the most outstanding view that Kippford has to offer\u0027.We made House of Horrors our home!

Applications to defer school entry for their four-year-old have increased by 84 per cent - suggesting it could soon become commonplace if the trend continuesAround one in ten - 11 per cent - of the councils surveyed said they agreed all requests for summer-born children to start reception a year later.Meanwhile 63 per cent said they do not approve all requests, but are more willing to allow this than they were previously.And 26 per cent said they only allow those with a very strong case to delay entry.A separate small-scale poll of around 161 parents who applied to delay found that nearly half had annual household incomes of £50,000 or more.And asked for their reasons for delaying a school start, the most common reason was whether parents felt their child was ready for school.Campaigners have argued that some summer-born children are not necessarily ready to start school when they have just turned four, while previous research has indicated that those born in the summer months may perform worse in assessments than their older, autumn-born classmates.There have also been concerns raised that some councils allow children to wait a year before starting school, but then are told they must join Year 1, missing out reception.In 2014, the DfE amended the admissions code to require admissions bodies to make decisions on whether to delay starting reception in the child’s best interests, including taking into account factors such as parents’ views.The following year, schools minister Nick Gibb wrote to councils saying that children should not be forced to join Year 1 if they wait to start school when they turn five.He argued that admissions rules needed to be changed to give summer-born youngsters the right to start in reception if they joined at this point."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/18/4C5D8D3C00000578-0-image-a-3_1526578572095.jpg","title":"How rest world celebrating Prince Harry Meghan Markles wedding","story":"    Guests at the Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club in Nairobi, Kenya (pictured) are being offered a wedding viewing party - complete with a \u0027champagne toast and live commentary throughout the ceremony\u0027Guests at the Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club in Kenya are being offered a wedding viewing  party - complete with a \u0027champagne toast and live commentary throughout the ceremony\u0027.Those lucky enough to attend the swanky do are invited to wear their \u0027finest wedding guest attire,\u0027 according to a poster advertising the event dubbed \u0027A Royal Wedding Celebration\u0027, and will indulge in British-inspired canapes and some bubbly.            For one million Kenyan shillings - or about £7,500 per guest - guests will also enjoy a two-night hotel stay, a helicopter trip to Mount Kenya plus all their meals leading up the televised ceremonyFor one million Kenyan Shillings - or about £7,500 per person - guests will also enjoy a two-night hotel stay, a helicopter trip to Mount Kenya plus all their meals prepped leading up the televised ceremony.  Meanwhile, royal watchers in Dubai - whose invitations are still in the post -have an array of places to lay their hat and cheer on the bride.The palatial Al Fayrooz lounge is  putting on English afternoon tea to guests who can watch the wedding on a 60inch screen while sat in their best wedding attire.For those wanting a more traditional English setting despite their desert surroundings, Gordon Ramsey\u0027s Bread Street Kitchen is hosting a wedding day brunch.And Scottish-themed pub The Copper Dog is providing Sunday roasts and glasses of vino in front of wide screen projectors for a snip at Dhs115 - or about £20.  For expats who made the transatlantic journey stateside, followers of the American Miss Markle need not look very far to find their share of wedding day bonhomie.Harry and Meghan look relaxed as they leave Windsor Castle...Share this articleThe most notable of which could be at in New Orleans at the Windsor Court hotel.The plush hotel is advertising a particularly pricey Royal Wedding Weekend Experience for a couple to receive a round-trip, first-class airfare from anywhere in the United States, three nights in the luxurious two-bedroom Presidential Suite, an afternoon ladies’ hat-fitting at a premier local milliner, and a $4,000 hotel credit for food, drinks and spa services.

Applications to defer school entry for their four-year-old have increased by 84 per cent - suggesting it could soon become commonplace if the trend continuesAround one in ten - 11 per cent - of the councils surveyed said they agreed all requests for summer-born children to start reception a year later.Meanwhile 63 per cent said they do not approve all requests, but are more willing to allow this than they were previously.And 26 per cent said they only allow those with a very strong case to delay entry.A separate small-scale poll of around 161 parents who applied to delay found that nearly half had annual household incomes of £50,000 or more.And asked for their reasons for delaying a school start, the most common reason was whether parents felt their child was ready for school.Campaigners have argued that some summer-born children are not necessarily ready to start school when they have just turned four, while previous research has indicated that those born in the summer months may perform worse in assessments than their older, autumn-born classmates.There have also been concerns raised that some councils allow children to wait a year before starting school, but then are told they must join Year 1, missing out reception.In 2014, the DfE amended the admissions code to require admissions bodies to make decisions on whether to delay starting reception in the child’s best interests, including taking into account factors such as parents’ views.The following year, schools minister Nick Gibb wrote to councils saying that children should not be forced to join Year 1 if they wait to start school when they turn five.He argued that admissions rules needed to be changed to give summer-born youngsters the right to start in reception if they joined at this point."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/22/4C50923C00000578-0-image-a-73_1526504802481.jpg","title":"John Bercow alleged called cabinet minister stupid woman f g useless","story":"    John Bercow has been at the centre of allegations that he bullied staff A Commons source said: \u0027Mrs Leadsom did not hear the remark herself but was left stunned when told about it by outraged colleagues.\u0027But she is very keen to rise above it and not let it distract from other very serious and worrying claims about bullying made in Parliament.\u0027The Speaker has been forced to deny allegations about bullying by former staff over recent weeks.PM?

Only a month ago the pound was eight cents higher against the dollar at $1.43.However, some analysts warned against exuberance after the FTSE 100 tumbled in the spring to below 7,000 before rising again to its current record level.Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The death of the bull market has been greatly exaggerated, not for the first time in recent history. The FTSE did endure a shaky start to the year but after two months of steady climbing has now regained and surpassed its previous high.”He said a stronger dollar, the rising cost of oil and the postponement of an interest-rate rise by the Bank of England last week can all claim credit for the recent strong showing from the stock market.“There will come a time when the stock market will tumble again, at which point investors should take it in their stride and look beyond the immediate situation.”Investors also appeared to be more relaxed about the outcome of Brexit negotiations after the prime minister indicated she had secured cabinet approval for a compromise over Britain’s future trading relationship with the European Union.Theresa May said the UK would leave the customs union but with a fallback option, as yet lacking any detail, that would allay fears of a hard border with the Irish republic.The move, which looks to effectively tie the UK to EU rules for several years after an interim period up to 2020, is expected to meet stiff opposition within the Tory party and could yet be scuppered in a final vote in the Commons.Gambling stocks initially came under pressure following the government’s decision to cut the top stake on betting terminals to £2.However, they rallied later in the day higher as investors expressed relief that the regulatory uncertainty was over and focused instead on the potential opportunities in the US following a supreme court decision that allows states to set their own rules for sports gambling.“Whilst £2 max stakes is a negative for the sector, if the implementation date is pushed back past 2020, online taxes come in later and the impact to EBITDA is less bad than feared, then there may be a sense of relief today,” Barclays analysts said.The mid-cap FTSE 250 index also hit a new record high, surpassing its previous mid-January record, up 0.9 per cent on the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35678e86cd0e0be84d9492a8b61ebb680993537c/0_64_3764_2258/master/3764.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a93887b1232048592c2737a926529a2f","title":"the guardian view on the cabinet and brexit beyond a joke","story":"There was a time, perhaps, when the government’s ineptitude over Brexit was almost funny. There is nothing funny about it now. For 15 months Theresa May has groped her way towards an approach that could reconcile her party’s Europe-loathers with her party’s Europe-pragmatists. All too predictably, none of her efforts have succeeded. Mrs May now has a month before the June European council at which the UK and the EU are due to review progress. She has five months before some kind of deal is struck. Progress? Deal? These words have lost all meaning. Getting two pandas to mate in captivity turns out to be a cinch compared with getting the Conservative party to agree what it wants.Mrs May’s latest suggestions for turning Brexit dross into an agreement that can be marketed as golden is a so-called “time-limited goods arrangement”. Essentially,\u0026nbspthis is an attempt to keep the UK within the EU’s external tariff system after Brexit until it can come up with an effective technological alternative to a post-Brexit hard border in Ireland. That way, the loathers would get their Brexit, the pragmatists would get something they could call a frictionless Irish border, Mrs May would have a united party for a few weeks and the UK would not crash out of the EU unprotected.The problem with all this is … well, where do we start? In the first place, this agreement is not nailed down yet. Boris Johnson, who is trying to get sacked in the hope this will help his dwindling leadership ambitions, opposes it. Michael Gove, attempting to position himself as the civilised alternative to Mr Johnson, does too. Outside the government, pragmatic pro-Europeans like Damian Green think the plan could be a starter. However, Jacob Rees-Mogg dismisses it as a vision of “perpetual purgatory”.Second, although actually more important, the rest of the EU has not been consulted. Even if the Tory party improbably comes together behind the idea, the real negotiation is with the EU and, on the key issue, with the Irish government. These talks have not taken place yet – not a small point. According to our Brussels correspondent, EU reactions range from the charge that the UK’s ideas are magical thinking to the view that they are “less use than a deodorant”. Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, meanwhile, says none of it “remotely approaches” the kind of terms that would avoid Britain’s trade relations with the EU plunging over a cliff at high speed in March next year. This could all be brinkmanship. It could also be true.There are also the small (not) matters of parliament and the people. Neither has been consulted yet. Both have to be taken seriously. Mrs May has to let MPs into the process at some point if she wants the much amended EU withdrawal bill to become law. Both the parliamentary numbers and the mood suggest she could lose a vote on the customs union, the very issue on which she is trying to strike a compromise in the cabinet. That’s why Mrs May has not definitely decided when to bring the bill back to the Commons.And then there’s the people – in two contexts. One is that MPs may still decide to put the eventual deal – if there is one and even if there isn’t – to a second referendum. The other, reportedly in Mrs May’s mind when she confronted Mr Rees-Mogg on it this week, is that Northern Ireland voters might reject a hard Brexit and, in effect, go in with the Republic on a soft border basis. People like Mr Johnson and Mr Rees-Mogg don’t think about such possibilities. They are real not imaginary. Their consequences would be immense. That is reason enough to say that the time for laughter, if it ever existed, ended long ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556b01fc33fe66ffba689f541aa914b127b99271/0_755_4307_2584/master/4307.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e34c0b4cbb9f765478f29e465573ae2","title":"struggling revision exams cramming experts","story":"From excessive highlighting to cramming, it’s easy to get into bad revision habits. Here, experts point a better way forwardIf you’re one to put hours into revising for an exam only to be disappointed with the results, then you may need to rethink your revision methods. You could be wasting time on inefficient techniques, says Bradley Busch, a registered psychologist and director of InnerDrive. “You get people putting in lots of effort, but not in a directed way,” he says. Here are some of the common ways students unwittingly waste study time, and what experts recommend you do instead.Re-reading and highlighting notes may feel like work, but it often won’t achieve much. The same goes for spending hours drawing up a revision timetable. Instead, psychologists recommend a technique called retrieval practice. This is anything that makes your brain work to come up with an answer. It can include doing quizzes, multiple choice tests, and past papers. “To really learn something, you’ve got to transfer information from working memory into long term memory, where you can store and later retrieve it,” says David Cox, a neuroscientist and journalist. “Committing something to long term memory isn’t easy, so it shouldn’t feel easy.”Beware of the planning fallacy, which is our tendency to underestimate how much time we really need to do something. It leads to sitting outside the exam hall with two hours to spare, desperately cramming. This is not an effective way to learn. “The information you gain quickly, you can lose quickly too,” says Busch.The opposite of cramming is spacing, which is the practice of spacing out your revision over time, doing little and often. So one hour a day for seven days is better than cramming seven hours into one day, for example. It’s also good to incorporate interleaving into your revision. This is a fancy way of saying you should mix up your subjects during a revision session. “It forces you to think about the problem and the strategy you come up with,” says Busch.Sifting through the recommended study playlists on Spotify, trying to work out which songs will help you to concentrate, is usually a waste of time. But while listening to music can help you relax, and some students may have “trained” themselves to concentrate with it on, it’s still better to study in silence, Cox says. “You’re never going to be as productive having music on in the background, because it’s preventing your brain from acting at maximum capacity.”We may check our phones as often as once every 12 minutes. Obviously, this is a major distraction. That’s not all: research has shown that just having your phone in sight when you revise is enough to negatively affect your concentration, even if you don’t use it. And it’s a common trap to fall into. “I usually have my phone on silent mode, but to be honest, if it’s there I always check it,” says Chiara Fiorillo, who studies at City, University of London. Ideally it’s best to banish your phone to another room altogether."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfdf138e57c55ec67898057cdb6b9330118745b/0_0_2985_4477/master/2985.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5459058cc09cc6334919182720fd92af 700w","title":"everything but the dress accessories to lift your wedding guest look","story":"Lots of weddings this summer?

It’s a theme that runs deep in her new movie, Leave No Trace, about a father and daughter living in the Oregon forest It feels fitting that the arrival of Debra Granik coincides with a rare downpour at Cannes. The director’s rough-hewn films are as detached from the aspirational sheen of Cannes as is possible, all muted greys and greens. Granik’s focus is on life in the margins, not the limelight – the daily struggle of the Americans who are not quite getting by. In her debut, Down to the Bone, it was a supermarket bagger and single mum scarred by a lifetime of cocaine abuse, played by Vera Farmiga. Then came the Oscar-nominated Winter’s Bone, a harrowing yet ultimately hopeful tale of poverty, meth addiction and loss in the Missouri Ozarks that launched the career of Jennifer Lawrence.Now comes a third feature, Leave No Trace, which stretches that theme of life on the margins to breaking point and is already being talked of as one of the year’s best releases. Adapted from Peter Rock’s survivalist novel, My Abandonment, it stars Ben Foster as an army veteran and New Zealander Thomasin McKenzie as his 13-year-old daughter. The pair live a quiet, deliberately off-grid life in a forested public park outside Portland, Oregon. They forage for mushrooms, sleep in a ramshackle camp and practice escape drills for when the authorities try to take them away. Inevitably, their unconventional way of life is threatened, prompting the pair to head off deeper into the wilderness of the Pacific north-west, embarking “physically and emotionally on their own Oregon trail”, as Granik puts it.While Foster is excellent as the bruised, introverted Will, it is McKenzie, as Tom, who steals the film. Headstrong, generous and smart, she is a tomboy in the old-fashioned sense of the word, says Granik, when it “meant ability, moxie, pluck”. In this sense, Tom shares a lot in common with Ree, Lawrence’s character in Winter’s Bone, a young woman whose self-reliant, can-do attitude stretched to catching, skinning and cooking her own squirrels.I had half-expected Granik to resemble her heroines – tough, taciturn and direct. She is anything but. Wide-eyed, genial and slightly hippyish, she responds to questions with loose, digressive answers crammed with detail about everything from Nordic folk tales to the radical environmental group Earth First. This same sense of detail is present in all Granik’s work. If her films feel lived-in and authentic, it is because of the hard graft that has gone into making them that way. She and her longtime producer, Anne Rosellini, spent years on the road researching Winter’s Bone, concerned about how it might look for a coastal liberal (Granik grew up in a well-off Washington DC suburb) to be directing a film about impoverished midwesterners.She continued that process on Leave No Trace, carrying out what she calls “reconnaissance” – for example “going to a truck stop and asking truckers how they would deal with a young woman coming up to them. We feel like investigative journalists at times,” she says. “We’re seeking informants. We’re learning about locations, processes to provide knowledge that we don’t have.”Granik’s reconnaissance often takes her into forgotten or ignored corners of the US. Another of her discoveries was Ron Hall, a Vietnam veteran and biker whom she met while scouting for cast members for Winter’s Bone. She gave Hall a small but significant role in that film and later made a documentary about him. Stray Dog follows Hall on cross-country motorcycle rides and volunteer work counselling veterans with PTSD. Hall inspired an interest in Granik about how trauma and depression manifest themselves among veterans, people who have seen horrors that the rest of us can’t fathom, and for whom reverting back to a “normal” existence isn’t always possible.Those issues manifest themselves in Leave No Trace, where it quickly becomes clear that Will is escaping what Granik calls “the amplified chatter of the digital era. It’s something that he immediately said: ‘This is clogging my circuitry.’ It’s similar with incarceration or other things where people come back to a world of such rapidity in the changes that are happening.”Of course, for many vets the solution lies in the bottle or, more commonly, pills. Opioid abuse is rife among US veterans, who are twice as likely to die from overdoses as non-veterans. It’s a shadow that looms over Leave No Trace. Will himself isn’t an addict, but contributes to the cycle of addiction, selling the medication he is prescribed for his PTSD on to other vets.This thought leads Granik to confront the questions that seem to haunt all her films. “Why is the US the biggest drug market in the world?” she asks. “Why is there this hunger for medicating? And what is so hard and dispiriting about some of the lifestyles that are promulgated in this country that requires people to medicate like this?” As she pauses, it’s clear Granik doesn’t have the answers to these questions yet. You suspect she is unlikely to stop until she finds them.Leave No Trace premieres at Sundance London on 3 June and is released on 29 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012b7a92c2e3debcff6b216b6fb94a62a5e08e79/456_294_1933_1160/master/1933.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8318398df41c946c404a54b5fe2873b","title":"arsene wenger interview emptied desk arsenal mikel arteta","story":"In his first major interview since leaving Arsenal the manager discusses his future, not being consulted over his successor and whether Mikel Arteta has the qualities for the jobArsène Wenger is finishing his breakfast in the Paris hotel where he has been coming for years and where the staff would not dream of addressing him in any other way than Monsieur Wenger, pronounced in hushed tones that convey the respect in which this grand man of world football is held in his native land.Dressed in slacks and an open-neck dark blue shirt, the man we must now refer to as the former Arsenal manager has treated himself to a mini pain aux raisins and, having finished his tea (no milk, no sugar), moved on to an espresso. In a sign that he is, perhaps, starting to let himself go just a tiny little bit, he continues spreading raspberry jam on a slice of bread (no butter) as we prepare to look back over his 22 years running one of the world’s top clubs.Typically from a man who has always been more interested in tomorrow than yesterday, Wenger begins with thoughts on his future. As we sit together for his first major interview since leaving Arsenal, the Huddersfield game – the last of his 1,235 matches in charge of the Gunners – is fresh in his mind.“It’s just too soon to know what I will do next,” he says. “I haven’t even emptied my desk yet and in a way I am still in a state of shock. I am going to give myself until June 14, the day the World Cup begins, to decide. The question is do I still want to coach, to be on the bench, or is it time to take up different functions? The one thing I can say for sure is that I will continue to work.“But do I want to continue to suffer as much? I want to continue to defend my ideas of football, that’s for sure. Spontaneously, I would say I still want to coach but I can’t really say that yet for sure.”Wenger has not stopped working for 34 years. In a time when managers are taking sabbaticals and the average  for a Premier League manager stands at less than two seasons, he has had no time off since he became the Nancy manger in 1984. With that in mind and no need, financially, to work another day, isn’t it time to put his feet up?“I have friends who can go and lay on a beach all day long for the whole of their holidays and I envy them,” he says with a grin. “I just can’t do that. I get bored. I need to be doing something. I need a challenge. I have lived and breathed football all these years and it’s a passion – I can’t imagine doing anything else. That’s why in a way this is an exciting moment for me, too. I have a new page, a blank page in front of me. As all good writers know, that can be a time of anguish but I hope I won’t have too much of that. It’s also a chance to write new chapters.”Talking football with Wenger is like having a living encyclopedia on hand. He has attended every major international tournament for as far back as he can remember and he will be at the World Cup as a pundit for beIN Sports, working for the Middle East and French channels when he is not flitting from game to game with his old friend David Dein. I have had the good fortune to accompany him on some of those travels and to work alongside him on some of those shows. Wenger is a dream for a TV host because he has a remarkable memory for games and players, an opinion on everything and often thinks differently to those around him. He is also much funnier than he might let on.During Euro 2016, for example, when he was working alongside big personalities such as Ruud Gullit, Marcel Desailly, Luis Fernández and Christian Vieri, each time I went into the green room to check on them it was invariably Wenger spinning the yarns and telling the jokes. When we finished the show each day with a football quiz, Wenger was just as competitive and playful as the other pundits, even joining celebrations with the studio audience and leading Mexican waves. In recent days the waves have been to say goodbye, and farewell. The outpourings of warmth at Arsenal but also at Old Trafford and Huddersfield moved the 68-year-old.“It was very touching to see,” Wenger says. “It has been a strange period – switching from contestation to unanimity in just a few days. Surprising, but quite nice also. I have the impression people wanted to salute my longevity, my fidelity to my club and perhaps the ideas about football I always tried to defend. I take it as a sign of recognition for the total commitment I have always had towards values I hold dearly – the desire to play dynamic, attacking football with a certain idea of how to go about it, too.“My type of loyalty probably doesn’t exist any more. Maybe the dinosaur I became was the last symbol of times that have changed. We are today in a society which is so quick to reject. There is no time to build, to construct, always this demand for results immediately. Maybe people wanted to manifest that too.“It was nice to see some of the recognition, I admit. When I arrived, you know, I was a complete unknown and I have always had the impression I am representing my country in a way. In a land where there has always been so much animosity between the English and the French I am proud to have achieved certain things and perhaps to have opened doors for other French coaches. Don’t forget, when I arrived in England a foreign manager was a very rare thing.”Although Wenger does not want to go into detail, he admits to having received many job offers. In France many imagine him as a natural fit for the Qatar-built project at Paris Saint-Germain. The club recently confirmed Thomas Tuchel as the next manager but Wenger is seen as an ideal chief executive.“I have had no discussions with them recently, I can tell you that in all honesty,” he says. “I have always been close to those in charge of PSG – I advised them to buy the club because I was convinced there were great things that could be done in a city which loves football. They have worked well and made a good start. I think people are too hard on them, too demanding. PSG just won all four national trophies in France and it’s not enough, apparently. But you cannot build a club with the idea that if you don’t win the Champions League then it’s a failure.”Although Wenger’s advice was sought by the owners of PSG, his opinions on what should happen next at Arsenal were not solicited. Where Sir Alex Ferguson named his successor, Wenger will be a spectator of future events at the Emirates.“At least that way they can’t blame me if there are bad results in the future,” he says with a laugh. “They didn’t ask me to be involved in that process. So I will let them choose the manager and afterwards I will support him, whoever it is.”Mikel Arteta’s name has oft been cited. What does he make of that? “I don’t want to influence that decision – it’s important they make their choice in an objective way and I don’t want anything I say to be misconstrued,” Wenger says. “I know how you do these things – if I say something nice about somebody you will say I am backing him but this is not the case. For Arteta, does he have all the qualities to do the job? Yes. He was a leader and he has a good passion for the game and he knows the club well. He knows what is important at the club and he was captain of the club. So why not? But whoever they choose I will support.”Before Wenger decides his future he must return to his office and clear out his things say a final goodbye to Arsenal. “I am an emotional man and it will be, perhaps, an emotional time but I will look around and see that life goes on. There will be youngsters training and playing and that will be a reminder of the passion I have for this game and my role as an educator. When you’re a young boy you have a dream and to fulfil that dream you need attitude and talent but you also need someone to give you a chance.“I grew up in a village and I met my first coach at the age of 19. But when I was 12, 13, 14 my dream was to meet somebody who would tell me how to play football. I was lucky – it didn’t stop me from making my life in the game but many don’t get that chance. As coaches we can change peoples’ lives, influence lives, and part of that is giving an opportunity to young players. That is one of the most beautiful things you can do.”We realise it is almost time for lunch and the French don’t mess with that. Just time for Wenger to take a photo with a young fan who tells him it’s perhaps the most beautiful day of his life, to sign the Arsenal shirt he is handed and stride off, destination unknown.

Gareth Southgate spoke with logic and humour but, most of all, he left the unmistakable sense that England’s manager may know a bit more about this level of football than some people realise. “The only thing that bothers me is that everybody keeps asking me about the pressure,” he said. “That’s when I start to think: ‘Bloody hell, maybe I’m not seeing what it should be’. If I felt underprepared, if we were not ready and we’d spent the last 10 days flapping about who should be in, I would probably feel more anxious.”Instead, he and his staff have held a meeting every Monday to discuss his World Cup squad, the various back-up options and all the logistics of preparing for a major tournament. Small details, in many cases, right down to whether the players should avoid the “misery” of Twitter and inviting a psychologist to join them in Russia. Dr Pippa Grange, who will travel with the squad, has presumably been warned to expect some resistance from one or two players. To quote Jamie Vardy when Leicester City did something similar: “There’s no point putting a psychologist in front of me because he won’t get inside my head.”The players will meet on Sunday but, first things first, Southgate has given them permission to go on holiday this week with no rules attached. Was that a risk bearing in mind some of the headlines England’s footballers have attracted before other tournaments? “Before Euro 96 I had three days in Magaluf with Aston Villa,” Southgate explained, “so it would be a bit hypocritical for me to discuss what the correct preparation was. Everything in a footballer’s life these days is ‘fill this bloody form in’. There’s a danger we overfill them with professionalism and doing the right thing. They need a switch-off and I don’t see an issue. I’m not interested in what they do over the next few days.”Southgate kept his memories of Magaluf to himself but there was a giveaway smile. “I went for a run on a couple of mornings,” he said. “Though it might have been a run back home, rather than a ‘run’.”To put it another way, the England manager intends to take the unusual step of treating his players like adults. Again, it’s the small details, such as allowing them to leave England’s base camp in Repino to visit St Petersburg without feeling the need to call out a search party.Other managers would impose curfew times or restrict access to mobile phones. “I don’t like loads of rules,” Southgate countered. “The players are responsible enough, they know what’s expected. Sometimes, if they have their phones that means they spend time together, looking at videos and interacting. If they haven’t, they just rush back to their rooms.”In Fabio Capello’s days as manager, the Football Association issued an official code of conduct rationing the time players spent on video or computer games, as well as banning them from making comments on social media unless it was authorised. Quietly, that has been abolished under Southgate’s tenure. He will, however, warn his players that Twitter can be an instant mood-killer. “Personally I’m not sure there’s value to reading the comments that come in,” he said. “It comes back to what creates pressure, or what creates misery, in your life. Generally, there’s a lot of social media that can be negative, so why invite that into your life?”Nobody pointed out there was more just one dissenter after Southgate had named his squad earlier in the week. Yet the England manager did not show a flicker of self-doubt when it came to explaining his choices and, though he was tactful not to say anything that could be construed as overly critical, there were various clues when it came to the players who had been left out.All the great teams, he said, from Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s, to Milan in the 1990s and the modern Manchester City, had “athleticism, energy and pace”. He wanted his team to press the opposition, he added, and hunt down the ball. Listening to this little speech, it felt clear why Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey were considered only briefly.The explanation for Shelvey’s omission concluded with a mention of checking the “character and personality” of all the players. Southgate reiterated his sympathies for Ryan Bertrand and insisted the door was still open for Joe Hart if the goalkeeper found a new club next season and returned to form. Not so much Chris Smalling, though, after being excluded because Southgate wanted England’s centre-halves to be better on the ball. “We made that decision in November and I’ve not seen any reason to change the thinking,” he said.For someone who was once considered too gentlemanly to make the really tough calls, Southgate has quietly taken a sledgehammer to a number of international careers. For that, there were no apologies, just the clear impression that he was happy with his choices and not willing to bend for anyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e654d0b3b29601984b29730f8fa3ee584bad6ab0/0_138_3402_2042/master/3402.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8bbffb97c659be7a969979e70275e3b","title":"pep guardiola signs contract extension manchester city","story":"• Manager had one season remaining on his deal• Guardiola due to spend at least five years with CityPep Guardiola signed a new contract to commit himself to Manchester City for another three years and immediately warned the rest of English football that his intention was to make his record-breaking team even more formidable opponents.Guardiola has agreed a two-year extension to his present deal, which had another 12 months to run, meaning he will have until 2021 to achieve the club’s ambition of winning the Champions League for the first time.“I am so happy and excited,” he said. “It’s a pleasure to be able to work here. I enjoy working with our players every day and we will try to do our best together in the coming years.“I will focus on the desire of my players to become a better team and every day that’s what I will try to do – to improve on the pitch and improve our players. We have a young squad with an average age of 23 and we want to keep taking steps forward and maintain the levels we’ve achieved this season.”Guardiola’s decision to commit himself to a new deal means, in theory, he will spend longer managing City than he did either Barcelona or Bayern Munich.His team won the Premier League by 19 points last season, setting a number of records in the process, and his new deal will almost certainly make him the highest paid manager in English football.“Pep’s contract extension is fantastic news for Manchester City,” Ferran Soriano, the club’s chief executive, said. “We have all been privileged to witness how we have played beautiful football, won titles, broken records and reached the incredible mark of 100 Premier League points. Pep has shown this style can succeed in the Premier League in a way it has never been done before. This season has been another step of our strategic plan and the continuous effort to improve the football we play. We are very pleased with the progress.”Gareth Southgate, the England manager, also paid tribute to Guardiola’s work, describing the 47-year-old Catalan as an inspiration for the whole of English football.“Who coaches our youngest players? It’s dads and parents and the impact of seeing that Barcelona team five to seven years ago was enormous. He’s been an innovator. When I watch kids’ football now, I see them playing out from the back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cba2c7ba469dcc27a71c51aee6e770af95bf781c/1639_1349_7245_4348/master/7245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4373a77cf27b246500c670d12028a643","title":"how to make the perfect hasselback potatoes","story":"These spuds look a lot more work than they are. But it’s important to follow a few simple steps to achieve that crisp, buttery and Instagrammable end resultHasselback potatoes, named after the Stockholm restaurant said to have created them, are one of those dishes that tend to look better than they taste: painstakingly chiselled fans of gloriously golden carbohydrate perfect for the Instagram age, yet sadly soggy on the fork. As Ed Smith writes in On the Side, “disappointingly, some so-called hasselback potatoes turn out to be little more than roast new potatoes with a few cuts in them”, when they should be a showstopping cross between a roast potato and a fried one, both comfortingly fluffy and satisfyingly crunchy. They may be more work than a pan of mash and not, perhaps, the kind of thing you’d knock up on a Tuesday evening, but if you’re out to impress, hasselbacks are the perfect accompaniment to steak, roast chicken, meaty fish or just about anything else that might demand a helping of chips – and they’re considerably easier to execute, too. Plus, did I mention they look good on Instagram?Not everyone thinks that hasselbacks should be fluffy: Nigella Lawson writes that she loves them made with new potatoes, too, recommending charlotte or ratte, choices echoed by Smith, Stevie Parle and Trish Hilferty in her book Lobster and Chips, which calls for “medium-sized waxy potatoes”.Ranged against them are Martha Stewart (her yukon golds, like Julia Moskin’s russets, are hard to get hold of in this country, but seem to be classified as “fluffy” by the British Potato Council, so I substitute Roosters), and Alastair Little, who calls for baking potatoes, which also get an airing in Moskin’s recipe, mainly because I can find no other spuds weighing a pound each.Alhough I don’t think such huge potatoes are the best suited for the hasselback treatment, because the crisp exterior to fluffy interior ratio is all wrong, I do prefer their fluffy texture to the smoothness of the waxy kind, which, soaked in butter, are almost too rich for my taste – more like fondant potatoes. Like chips and roast potatoes, fluffy seems the way to go.I’m pleased to discover that peeling the potatoes is traditional, but not mandatory: Little and Hilferty are the only ones to bother. In theory, it should help the exterior crisp up, but in practice it doesn’t seem to make much difference, and leaving the skins on gives the dish a better flavour.It does pay, however, to spend time on the cutting of the potatoes. Many of the recipes dictate slicing them in 5mm intervals, but, in the hope of speeding up the cooking process, I’m going to copy Smith’s 2-3mm intervals, which also have the (possibly questionable) benefit of making the potatoes look like oversized woodlice. To help you slice down, but not through them, you could run a skewer through their length, as Hilferty and Little recommend, or cut them between two chopsticks, like Parle, but I find the simplest way is to put the potatoes in the bowl of a wooden spoon, as Molly Wizenberg suggests on her blog Orangette. As potatoes are not a uniform diameter along their entire length, slicing at a slight angle, à la Little, often makes life easier.Rinsing off some of the surface starch, a tip from Hilferty, does seem to help stop them sticking together Little’s cold water bath presumably serves the same purpose, but running water proves more effective.Moskin’s is the only recipe to pre-cook the spuds, boiling the monsters for 10 minutes, then allowing them to cool completely before baking. Athough this proves inconvenient, the idea isn’t a bad one: potatoes are dense things, and many of the recipes I try wildly underestimate the baking time, so it makes sense to give them a head start. However, I prefer Smith’s method of braising them in water in the oven itself: although the bottoms might not be quite as crunchy as those roasted just in butter, the tops still crisp up satisfactorily, and there are no questionable bits of semi-raw spud in the middle.The oven should be hot, but not too hot – Moskin’s 220C425Fgas 7 leaves the potatoes charred on top before they’ve had a chance to cook through – and it’s essential, as most recipes acknowledge, to keep basting them throughout the cook, “in order for the butter to penetrate”, as Parle puts it.Butter is the order of the day here – and lots of it. You could substitute olive oil, if you’d prefer to keep them vegan, or swap in duck or goose fat or even good beef dripping, but, for me, potatoes and butter are a match made in heaven. You don’t need anything else, but garlic goes well with butter, of course, and also has the benefit of helping to wedge the slices open. If you don’t like garlic, shallots or onions work just as well, or you could use bay leaves or sage, but be careful not to overdo it, because a little goes a long way with both.Smith also adds caraway seeds, and Moskin sweet and smoked paprika intended to replicate the smoky bacon she reckons the originals were wrapped in, but I find no mention of this elsewhere. It does indeed give her potatoes a “gorgeous ruddy colour”, however, and would be lovely with roast pork or barbecued meat or veg.8 medium floury potatoes, such as maris pipers or king edwards (about 800g-1kg)6 garlic cloves, peeled3 bay leaves (optional)50g butter2 tbsp dry breadcrumbs, tossed with a little olive oil (optional)Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Find an ovenproof frying pan or a heavy, hob-safe baking tin that’s just large enough to hold the potatoes in a single layer.Put each potato in the bowl of a wooden spoon and, at roughly 2mm intervals, cut carefully down, but not quite through, the potato, maintaining a slight angle towards the centre of the potato.Slice the garlic, and stuff several pieces into each potato, making sure you push them well down so they don’t burn. Tear the bay leaves, if using, into several pieces and do the same.Meanwhile, melt the butter in the pan or tin over a medium heat until sizzling. Put in the potatoes one by one, and carefully turn them in the butter to coat, then pour in enough cold water to come halfway up the sides of the potatoes.Bring to a boil, then roast for an hour and 30 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.

By  Daniel TrillingThe opening ceremony of the London Olympics, on 27 July 2012, should have been a moment of triumph for Kelvin Bilal Fawaz. The talented young boxer had recently been crowned the amateur light middleweight champion of England, and he was meant to be marching with the athletes of Team GB as they paraded into the Olympic Stadium.Fawaz was born in Nigeria, and trafficked to Britain as a child – where he was rescued by the state and raised in care. Now he was a champion, ready to represent his country, with a lucrative professional career ahead of him. But there was one problem: he wasn’t a British citizen. In fact, it wasn’t clear if he had permission to stay in the UK at all. As a child, he had been given temporary leave to remain until just before he turned 18 – but he had to apply to extend this as an adult, and by 2012, at the age of 24, he was still waiting for a response. Like the rest of us, he watched the Games on television.Since then, Fawaz has lost almost everything: his nascent career, his marriage, and ultimately, his liberty. Now 29, he has lived his entire adult life in the UK without valid immigration status, which means he has no right to work and is liable to be detained and deported at a moment’s notice. During the past decade, he has applied and appealed for extended leave to remain he has applied for a spousal visa he has even asked to be registered as stateless person. All these requests have been turned down by the Home Office, which considers his presence in the UK undesirable.The Windrush scandal has brought attention to the “hostile environment” policy introduced by Theresa May in 2012 to drive unwanted immigrants from the UK. But Fawaz has become ensnared in a lesser-known policy – another Home Office scheme designed to remove immigrants, purportedly by targeting the most dangerous foreign criminals.This is called Operation Nexus, a joint initiative between police forces and immigration enforcement. Launched in 2012, it has received little public scrutiny – official guidance notes describing it were only published last year. But it goes even further than previous schemes to deport “foreign criminals”, because it also targets people, such as Fawaz, who have never been to prison. In his late teens and early 20s, Fawaz received convictions for minor offences such as cannabis possession, driving without insurance and spraying graffiti he points out that he has never received a harsher sentence than community service, and argues that he is a reformed character. For the Home Office, none of this matters.In fact, the state has been trying to force Fawaz from the UK for several years – but he has nowhere to go. Although he was born in Nigeria, his mother came from Benin and his father from Lebanon. Nigeria won’t accept Fawaz as a citizen, and according to Fawaz, neither will his parents’ countries of birth. The Home Office doesn’t believe him, so it keeps trying. In the meantime, he survives on donations and trains at his local boxing gym. The gym is his life: he hoovers it, he cleans the toilets, he has even slept there when he’s had nowhere else to stay. Legally speaking, he has all but reached the end of the road. His best chance may well be to throw himself once more on the mercy of the Home Office and ask for the state to be sympathetic and make an exception.In this regard, Fawaz has more in his favour than others who find themselves in similar situations. His talent is undeniable, and making a contribution through sport is a well-worn path to acceptance for immigrants. Fawaz has represented England in international competition six times, including against Nigeria: as he puts it, he has literally bled for his adoptive country, in the ring. He has made something of his turbulent life, and passes his knowledge on to young people and children at the gym, so that they might avoid the mistakes he once made. But the Home Office disagrees: its press officers point out that Fawaz has 15 criminal convictions in total. “When someone has no leave to remain in the UK, we expect them to leave the country voluntarily,” is their rote reply to journalists. “Where they do not, we will seek to enforce their departure.”After years of living in uncertainty, Fawaz was suddenly arrested in November last year, placed in detention and told he would be imminently deported to Nigeria. His story became national news. A petition started by a member of the public demanding that the Home Office grant Fawaz British citizenship received more than 100,000 signatures. After several weeks in a detention centre, he was released on bail.Our reactions to these stories follow a familiar pattern. Attention focuses on the merits of the inidual: has this person worked hard, have they contributed, have they played by the rules? If they don’t deserve to be treated like this, then the implication is that other people do deserve it: “If only we could create an immigration system that caught the bad foreigners – the illegals and the criminals – and left the innocent alone.” As more details come to light about the damage caused by the government’s “hostile environment” for unwanted immigrants, this question is at the forefront of political debate. But Fawaz’s story shows how, in trying to make an increasingly severe distinction between the deserving and the undeserving, the UK casts many people into a bureaucratic limbo that effectively criminalises their existence in this country. What if, instead of finding “illegal immigrants”, our policies are creating them?In early February this year, I met Fawaz as he joined a group of campaigners from 38 Degrees to hand in his petition at the Home Office’s headquarters in Westminster. He arrived late, greeting each of us as if we were old friends. When he asked me to take a photo of him for his Instagram feed outside the Home Office entrance, he turned on the charm. “This is so good,” he exclaimed in a soft, London-inflected voice. He gave polite but firm instructions to the camera crew who were filming an interview with him: “Don’t just ask me how people can help. Ask me human questions.”For several years now, there has been a trickle of stories about bizarre or apparently cruel decisions in immigration cases, in which people who have spent many years – or even their whole lives – in the UK are ordered to leave the country. In recent months, thanks to dogged reporting on the subject, the fate of the Windrush generation has become a national scandal. Now, the focus is widening to other people caught up in the “hostile environment”, the harsh system of internal border controls that the prime minister made her flagship policy when she was home secretary.But our fractious national debate about immigration is based on three categories whose definitions are not fixed: “illegal”, “criminal” and “foreign”. In fact, it is easy to see how their meanings have shifted under the pressure of media outrage and government policy. During the last two decades, the shift has been in one direction: to broaden our idea of who is a foreign criminal and who is an illegal immigrant, which in turn justifies harsh new policies, and authoritarian structures.At the centre of this is the Home Office, the government department with perhaps the most direct impact on our daily lives. It is responsible for the police, fire services, MI5, immigration and border control – in short, many of the ways in which a state is supposed to keep its citizens safe. But because of this role, it often finds itself under pressure from within government and without. On the one hand, it is frequently attacked by rightwing media for perceived failures to prevent crime or control immigration, and by liberal critics for apparent heavy-handedness. On the other, it sometimes sees itself at odds with fellow government departments, looking out for the ordinary British citizen while officials elsewhere make decisions based solely on what’s best for economic growth and competitiveness. The result, as a group of academic researchers concluded in their recent book Go Home? The Politics of Immigration Controversies, is “an organisation that feels embattled and misunderstood”, which develops new policy “at an unusually high speed”, often in response to pressure from the media and with one eye on the news cycle.Although the policies introduced by May were some of the most hardline yet, they are part of a longer-term pattern of anti-immigrant rhetoric. One of the flashpoints in this process is how the state deals with foreign-national offenders: people who aren’t British citizens who commit crimes in the UK. This is one of the most sensitive parts of the immigration system: serious crimes committed by people with limited or no right to be in the country often generate furious press coverage, as do bureaucratic obstacles to their removal, such as human rights laws.It is often hard to tell what is the greater cause for outrage: the crime itself, or the foreignness of the offender. In this atmosphere, for more than a decade, successive governments have promised to deport ever-larger numbers of these people, but in doing so, they have followed a dangerous logic, whereby the nature of the threat we are supposed to be protected from has shifted – from particular crimes to a vague, expanding category of the “foreign criminal”.The first big media storm about foreign criminals erupted in the summer of 2006, after it emerged that 1,000 foreign prisoners had been released at the end of their sentences without being considered for deportation, as the rules required. Labour’s home secretary, Charles Clarke, was forced to resign his replacement, John Reid, declared the immigration directorate “not fit for purpose” and launched a series of reforms to restore public confidence in the system. UK borders were rebranded, with flags, insignia and uniformed staff, while a communications strategy focused on getting more immigration raids into the media. And in 2007, the UK Borders Act introduced the automatic deportation of “foreign criminals” convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned for more than 12 months.Since its landslide victory in 1997, the New Labour government had tried to outflank its critics on the right by taking a tough line on crime and immigration. Rather than challenging the claim that these two phenomena were inextricably linked, it reinforced the idea: as late as 2010, Labour’s election manifesto contained a section entitled Crime and Immigration. In the early days of New Labour, the focus was on asylum seekers, who were the target of exaggerated press claims about people trying to exploit Britain’s system of refugee protection. In the early 2000s, Labour dramatically expanded Britain’s network of immigration detention centres in order to lock up asylum-seekers while their claims were processed. After 2007, the government found a new use for the additional facilities: to detain the increased number of foreigners who were being scheduled for deportation after their prison sentences had ended.At a stroke, Labour had drastically expanded the definition of a dangerous foreign criminal. The policy had an immediate effect, raising the number of offenders removed from the UK from under 3,000 in 2007 to nearly 4,500 in 2008. But they did little to reduce the salience of immigration as an issue in the minds of voters or newspaper editors. When the Conservatives came to power, having pledged to reduce immigration to the “tens of thousands”, the incoming home secretary Theresa May focused much of her energy on removing unwanted people from the UK. In 2012, she gave an interview to the Daily  in which she declared her intention to create “a really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants: initiatives to identify and deport people, or to make everyday life so difficult for them that they would leave of their own accord. A host of new laws followed in the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts, which extended border control into everyday life by criminalising bureaucratic irregularities and forcing public servants and private companies to check the immigration status of prospective clients. These were accompanied by measures to encourage government agencies to collect and share immigration data more effectively.At the same time, Operation Nexus was rolled out to a series of police forces in England. Its definition of “foreign criminal” is far broader than the policy that existed before 2007 broader, too, than how New Labour redefined it. Serious offenders fall under its remit, but so do people convicted of minor offences.Yet if you look at the deportation figures, a strange picture emerges. The number of people deported from within the country (as opposed to those turned away at ports and airports) has stayed roughly steady at between 10,000 and 12,000 a year. That’s because deporting someone – an “enforced removal” in official euphemism – is a complicated process. A Home Office document entitled Country Returns Guide gives us some insight: this spreadsheet, a resource for civil servants, lists more than 200 countries and comments on how co-operative they are at taking their citizens back from the UK. Alongside each entry, wherever possible, are comments noting roughly how long it will take to issue a travel document (anywhere from a few days to six months, depending on the country), what kind of supporting evidence is required to prove a person’s nationality, and remarks on the country itself. In many cases the information is unclear or incomplete.It is for this reason that many of May’s policies are aimed at convincing people to leave of their own accord. But while you might expect the number of so-called “voluntary returns” to have increased since 2012, there has been no significant growth here, either. Indeed, the total number of returns, voluntary or enforced, has actually fallen since 2014. So as new policies seek to bring more and more people into the state’s immigration dragnet, fewer people are being made to leave. Instead, they are thrown into a state of uncertainty that can last many years. This is what happened to Fawaz.On Wednesday evenings, Stonebridge Boxing Club in north-west London is in full flow. When I visited, in mid-February, around 50 people were there for a training session, shouted at by a handful of coaches. The gym, on the second floor of a half-built office block, was hot with overworked bodies, and every 30 seconds or so there was a thud and a rattle as dozens of people, men and a few women, hit punchbags in unison. Most of the people there were black, Asian or eastern European. Stonebridge is in Brent, one of the most ethnically erse parts of London it is also one of the boroughs where, in 2013, the Home Office trialled a scheme to drive around advertising vans bearing the slogan: “In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.”As I watched, Aamir Ali, the club’s owner, pointed people out to me: two of the coaches had boxed for Nigeria and Lebanon, respectively, at the 1992 Olympics. Mikael Lawal, a young Londoner of Nigerian heritage, is the first from the gym to turn professional. In the main ring, a boxer who had recently arrived from Kazakhstan was dispatching one challenger after another with rapid blows, not seeming to tire. He had come to the UK to try his luck at a professional career, Ali explained a friend from his home village has lived in London for years and is a regular. “United Nations, is all I’m saying,” he joked.Although immigration is nothing new to Britain, its nature and shape has changed in recent decades. Between 1993 and 2014, the number of foreign citizens living in the UK rose from nearly 2 million to more than 5 million. At the same time, a series of changes to the law have made it much harder for these residents to secure UK citizenship. Instead, Britain’s multiethnic communities live with a plethora of temporary and precarious forms of leave to remain. Academics call this “multi-status Britain” – people have jobs, lives and families here, but on paper they are foreign.Fawaz arrived midway through the session, wearing an immaculate white T-shirt, fedora and ripped jeans that contrasted with everyone else’s sweaty gym gear. He walked around greeting people as a visiting celebrity might, then stood by a corner of the ring and watched the fight with the Kazakh boxer. His expression turned serious, and his head nodded in the rhythm of the two men.When Fawaz tells his story, he does it in soundbites and neat, well-worn anecdotes – the behaviour of a sportsman with one eye on fame, perhaps, but it is also what immigration control demands of its subjects. Testimony becomes everything, and the complex details of a life are turned into claims and counter-claims. By his account, this is roughly how it goes: he was born in northern Nigeria to a Lebanese father and a mother from Benin. His mother abused him (“You know when someone has a life that is not good for them and they take their anger out”) and his father left him with an “uncle” – either a relative or a family friend, Fawaz isn’t sure – in Lagos. During this time his mother was murdered in religious riots, and in 2004, when Fawaz was 14, his uncle announced that he was taking him to London to reunite him with his father. He was flown to the UK – on what documents, Fawaz doesn’t know – but instead of meeting his father, he was given to a family who held him captive and made him work as a domestic servant. After a few months, he escaped, and was taken into the care of social services in a west London borough.In the back office of the gym, overlooked by wallpaper bearing the famous 1930s photo of New York workmen eating their lunch on the girder of a half-built skyscraper, Fawaz told me what happened to him after he escaped his captors. To use the language of child protection workers, he had been trafficked into domestic servitude. The government offers protection to trafficked children, but it has strict limits, to avoid opening up a kind of back door to permanent citizenship. In most cases, they are refused asylum and granted a type of temporary leave to remain that expires before they turn 18. This is usually on the basis that there are no safe reception facilities for children in their home countries, but it means that they spend the formative years of their lives not knowing if they will be expelled from the UK when they become adults. Frequent delays in processing applications, which can take several years, increase the uncertainty further – making it even more difficult for children raised in care to build stable adult lives.Given temporary leave to remain, “while they worked out what to do with me”, Fawaz was placed in a group foster home in west London until he turned 16, then moved to a halfway house for older teenagers. There, he joined some of his new neighbours in what he described as “bad stuff. Weed, graffiti, sex with different girls, alcohol, smoking. It was only when I left that era that I looked back and I was like: ‘Oh my god, you really, really was going down.’”In early adulthood, as he waited to find out if he would be allowed to stay in the UK, Fawaz received a string of minor criminal convictions. But this was also a period, he told me, in which his life began to change for the better.Second, he met and fell in love with a young woman, who he married. “She retuned me, she made me see things differently,” he told me. Fawaz received a national diploma in sports science and was offered a place at university, although he couldn’t take it up because of his uncertain immigration status: without leave to remain, he was not eligible for a student loan. Gradually, his success in amateur boxing competitions – and the demands of training – led Fawaz further and further away from his old friends. In early 2012, he won the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA)’s national competition, becoming light middleweight champion of England. This convinced him to focus on his career, although he had not entirely put his old life behind him: his last criminal conviction was in 2014. Fawaz said a series of violent incidents, in which he was attacked or threatened, convinced him to completely break off contact with his former friends.I asked Fawaz to imagine his life since arriving in the UK – his life in care, his shift from delinquency to boxing – as a line on a graph. He moved his hand upwards in a steep slope, representing his progress all the way until that championship victory in 2012. And then he dropped his hand, sharply. It was in that year that his request to stay in the UK – made years earlier, when he was still a teenager – was rejected. With his status unresolved, Fawaz had no right to work and could not turn professional: he says he had to turn down a contract from a top boxing promoter worth more than £200,000.Next, Fawaz made a series of appeals that were turned down. The ABA wrote to the Home Office five times to ask that Fawaz be given travel documents and a work visa. Another attempt, to gain naturalisation via marriage, was rejected because Fawaz did not have the right to be in the UK at the time of his wedding. After several more years, having exhausted all legal avenues, he was issued with a document ordering him to leave the country, and told to sign in at an immigration reporting centre every week or face being detained.And yet, he said, he still couldn’t obtain a passport from any other country. The stress of this period, Fawaz said, led to the breakup of his relationship in 2015. At that point, he told me, he stopped boxing: “I gave up. I lost everything, I lost my motivation, I started drinking.” He suffered depression, and during a period in between houses, would sometimes sleep on public transport.Operation Nexus was Theresa May’s attempt to solve a problem that had bedevilled home secretaries since John Reid. Although the number of foreign-national offenders removed from the UK initially rose sharply, it has been stuck at roughly the same level ever since. Piloted in London, and since extended to other parts of England, Nexus is a way for police and immigration officials to identify “high harm” foreign national offenders and remove them.Some police forces now station immigration officers in custody suites, and others make immigration checks on everyone they arrest. When a person applies for citizenship, or to extend their leave to remain, their details are cross-checked with police records and, if necessary, passed on to specialist Nexus casework teams employed by the Home Office. As with other immigration cases, people can appeal against the decision to remove them, and evidence will be heard at a tribunal.But our notions of who counts as “illegal”, “criminal” and “foreign” depend on who defines them. And Nexus is playing a key role in broadening the terms of reference, so much so, in fact, that people with minor convictions – or even none at all – can find themselves labelled foreign criminals. On its own terms, the policy has been partly successful: between 2012 and 2015, for example, around 3,000 foreign-national offenders were removed.Some of these people committed serious crimes, but not all of them: Nexus also considers cases based on ancient, spent and petty convictions, and carries out “intelligence-led” deportation. Immigration tribunals have less strict rules of evidence than criminal courts, and a person can be more easily referred to Nexus the less secure their immigration status is. If you have valid immigration leave, according to the official Nexus guidance notes published by the Home Office, the police have to believe you pose a “current and ongoing threat to the public” to be referred. If you have no valid immigration leave – if, say, you are waiting for a decision on your application – you merely need to be “subject to active police interest” in order to be sucked into Operation Nexus and put before a tribunal.Melanie Griffiths, a social scientist at Birmingham University who has observed a number of Nexus-related appeals, has described how intelligence-led deportation leads to cases that “rest upon a medley of allegations, unproved assertions, hearsay, anonymous evidence, the behaviour of the appellant’s friends and circumstantial evidence”. Police often submit large bundles of evidence that include “non-convictions”: stop-and-searches where nothing is found, withdrawn charges, acquittals at trial and arrests that led to cautions or no charges. Officials are, in effect, able to paint a picture of serious criminality without having to definitively prove it.Fawaz told me that at one of his appeal hearings, “they brought police officers to testify against me”, who claimed he was a gang member. When I spoke to him, he was indignant at the suggestion that his minor convictions – “just naughty child stuff” – suggested something more serious. Other Nexus cases appear to work in such a grey area too: among the examples Griffiths collected was a teenager of Caribbean descent deemed “at risk” of joining a gang, an Eritrean refugee convicted of “illegal working” and a homeless, alcoholic Bangladeshi man who stole a steak.A standard defence of Operation Nexus would be that visitors to the UK have to abide by its laws, and that people should not commit crimes. Yet it exists in a context where the fact of living in the UK without secure immigration status is being treated increasingly like a crime itself.This is happening in two ways. First, specific new crimes are being created: among their provisions, the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts introduced the offences of “illegal working” and “driving when unlawfully in the UK”. Behaviour that would previously have been treated as a bureaucratic irregularity is now the behaviour of a “foreign criminal”.Second, enforcing the hostile environment involves treating immigrants – and people who look or sound like they might be immigrants – as potential criminals. Immigration enforcement officers have been granted greater powers to stop and detain people on the street. The laws compelling landlords, bank clerks, NHS staff and university administrators to check prospective clients’ immigration status turn ordinary citizens into border guards, while data-sharing initiatives on schoolchildren (cancelled by the Department of Education in April after a public campaign) or NHS patients (partially suspended earlier this month) increase the state’s powers of surveillance.At the same time, it has become much harder to fight for the right to remain. Since 2012, people in the UK without status must live here for 20 years before they can apply for temporary leave to remain on the basis of “long residence” it would take around 30 years in total to receive indefinite leave. Fawaz, who arrived in the UK aged 14, would be in his mid-40s if he took this uncertain route. It has become much harder to win an immigration appeal on human-rights grounds after new guidelines were introduced. Fees for citizenship applications have soared (from £200 in 2002 for indefinite leave to remain, to £2,389 in 2018), while cuts to legal aid as part of the coalition government’s austerity measures forced the collapse of the two main providers of free immigration advice.But for all this effort, the removal figures for foreign-national offenders have not grown – they vary between around 5,000 and 6,000 a year. In 2014, the National Audit Office found that removing offenders cost £850m annually – and was hindered by poor administration and other countries not co-operating. Much like the other policies intended to make life difficult for unwanted immigrants, Operation Nexus aims to remove people, but ends up leaving many in a precarious and ultimately untenable position, as it has done to Fawaz: still in the country, but with their rights and ability to move freely severely limited.I visited Fawaz again at the gym on a weekday afternoon when it was almost empty. Fawaz and a friend were in the ring together. Every now and then Fawaz would shout out advice to his less-skilled partner: to keep his feet moving, to think about his centre of gravity, to anticipate his opponent’s next move so he could dodge it.“I’ll just take the punch,” said the friend through his mouthguard, in a moment of bravado.“Why?” asked Fawaz. “Don’t take a punch unless you’re prepared to sacrifice something for it.”Aware that I was watching, Fawaz began to expound his theory of boxing. “Power isn’t everything … I don’t waste all my energy, I play … I do salsa dancing – who said men can’t do feminine things?”Stonebridge Boxing Club, Fawaz told me, is what rescued him after his marriage broke down. He began training there properly three years ago, occasionally competing for amateur titles: he won the ABA London middleweight championship in 2017. “I don’t want to waste the essence I have in me,” he said, explaining how he was trying to conserve his energy until his citizenship status was resolved. “So I made a conscious choice to only fight once a year.” His latest interest outside boxing is making afrobeats music: Fawaz sings, while a friend produces. He posts Instagram stories of himself dancing and singing in the studio. “I’m not a lazy person, you know,” he cautioned.Towards the end of last year, a few months after an application to be considered stateless was rejected – again, the Home Office did not believe Fawaz when he said he wasn’t eligible for citizenship elsewhere – his resolve faltered. His depression came back, and he missed several of his weekly sign-in appointments at his local Home Office reporting centre. On 29 November, as Fawaz was on his way into the gym, the building was surrounded by police and he was arrested by immigration enforcement officers. He was kept overnight in Wembley police station, and then driven to a detention centre near Gatwick airport – where officials told Fawaz that they were preparing to deport him to Nigeria.The UK places nearly 30,000 people in immigration detention each year, of whom half are foreign-national offenders. Detaining immigrants is officially supposed to be used as a last resort – and only when there is a reasonable prospect of imminently removing someone from the country. A recent Amnesty International report found that immigration detention has now become a “routine” procedure, in which administrative mistakes were common but difficult to put right. Once someone has entered detention, the report found, they are often kept there “as a matter of convenience”. Around half are released back into the community, which suggests that many should not have been in there in the first place. But the number of people released on bail from detention – living in limbo, as Fawaz now does – has more than doubled since 2010, to nearly 4,000 last year.Fawaz was initially bullish when he described his time in detention, calling it a “clarification of the mind”. He said he had spent most of his time in the centre’s gym, or teaching himself how to play the piano. But it was obvious the experience had disturbed him. He said he had self-harmed several times while he was there – “not because I wanted to die but because it’s a relief for me” – and showed me marks on his wrists and forearms.“For the first week, I felt like my life was finished,” he said. “Like an abandoned kid again.” His spirits were lifted when his case made national news. “Even the security in there came up to me and said: ‘You’re famous, man, everyone’s talking about you.’” Some weeks later, a representative of the Nigerian high commission told officials working on Fawaz’s case that he was not their citizen. On 2 January, an immigration tribunal appeals judge released Fawaz on bail, back to his old life of weekly sign-ins.One evening at the end of January, Fawaz stepped on stage at Amnesty International’s events hall in east London. The audience had just watched Leon Gast’s documentary When We Were Kings, which tells the story of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman’s 1974 world heavyweight championship match in Zaire. The film still has a political charge: Ali and Foreman’s views on history, racism and the role that boxing plays in reclaiming black power sit uncomfortably next to contributions from Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, white American writers praising the physique of their black compatriots and shouting with glee as they fight in the ring.The politics of the film were especially resonant at this event: a monthly club hosted by Welcome Cinema and Kitchen, an organisation that brings refugees, asylum seekers and the public together for social events. Many of the attendees were living with precarious legal status, and had come to hear Fawaz talk about his own situation.Before the event, he had been entertaining children in the creche downstairs, showing off his title belts and cracking jokes as he posed for photos. But when he entered the hall and saw his picture projected on to a large screen, he gasped in surprise. Fawaz’s self-confidence is evident, but there is also a certain naivety that came from his upbringing: he told me that he had barely left the west London suburbs until his early 20s.Since being released from detention, with the prospect of being recalled at any moment, Fawaz now has three possible routes. The first is to make another application to the Home Office: his lawyers are considering options for an appeal, supported by the 100,000 signatories of the 38 Degrees petition. If that fails, he could still be deported, but this is unlikely, since Nigeria, which usually co-operates with the UK in deportations, has been firm in insisting he is not theirs. This leaves a third route: an endless limbo as the UK tries unsuccessfully to remove him, and facing destitution if the donations he gets from friends dry up. Many of the people in the Welcome Cinema audience risked finding themselves in similar situations some, perhaps, already were. This complex system for removing immigrants affects thousands of men, women and children in Britain today, yet as Melanie Griffiths points out in her research, it’s striking how recent a phenomenon it is.Although states practised banishment or transportation throughout much of history, this largely stopped in the 19th century with the rise of the nation state. In the UK, deportation was reintroduced by our first modern immigration restrictions, the 1905 Aliens Act. But it was only during the 1990s that it began to be used on a large scale – at first to remove failed asylum seekers, and now as a more general tool for immigration control.Operation Nexus is one of the most sensitive parts of this system most politicians would shrink from giving it proper scrutiny. Yet as Fawaz’s story suggests, it seems to offer little room for redemption, which is usually regarded as an important part of the criminal justice system. There is also a wider question about equality before the law: do certain people deserve to be punished twice for a crime, on the basis of their immigration status?The drive to make expulsions easier is also adding a chapter to Britain’s relationship with its former colonies: the UK is spending £700,000 to build a prison wing in Nigeria for deportees, and has offered to fund a maximum-security prison in Jamaica. Deportation charter flights, in which immigration detainees are removed en masse, now operate several times a year to West Africa and South Asia.Governments often try to make distinctions between good citizens and bad citizens – the welfare scroungers v the hard-working families – but the way Britain has hardened its borders has created a situation that many of us were unaware of until recently, in which people who have lived in this country for many years find their right to stay here permanently under question. Griffiths calls them “almost citizens”. I mentioned this to Fawaz: “That’s me!” he exclaimed. “You know when you chuck a leaf in a stream of water and you don’t know where it’s going, you just – I have no control over this now. At this point, it’s up to the Home Office to give me a chance. To say: yes you can stay.”Fawaz’s first name – Kelvin – is a nickname he acquired as a teenager. At our last meeting, I asked him where he had got it from. “I just made it up when I came here,” he told me. “Because I kept on telling people my name is Bilal Fawaz and they couldn’t pronounce it, so I said: ‘OK, my name is Kelvin.’ I wanted to sound more British. I took on the persona.”  Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe by Daniel Trilling is published by Picador on 31 May, and is available to buy at bookshop.

Busy being busy. Busy flying around the world in the tirelessly altruistic pursuit of putting as much distance between himself and the UK. It works best this way for everyone concerned. He gets to clock up the air miles and stay in luxury five-star hotels. The country is spared any direct contact with its international trade secretary. No harm done.Departmental questions are normally an opportunity for MPs to find out what has been going on. But as the whole purpose of the international trade department is to do absolutely nothing – Fox would take it as a personal failure, a resignation matter even, were he ever to agree a trade deal – then the question session is a fundamentally pointless exercise. A procedural formality that has to be followed for the sake of parliamentary decorum.It wasn’t always like this. Back in the early days of Theresa May’s government, there was some interest in trade, and the back benches would generally be quite full with MPs eager to find out who we would be trading with post-Brexit. But everyone quickly realised there was a reason why Fox – the go-to man for hedonistic inertia – had been put in a charge, and now international trade questions is one of the more sparsely attended sessions in the Commons calendar. Only the lost, the lonely and the overtly masochistic now bother to show up.Some questions are now off limits. Some MPs used to enquire about the progress of trade deals just to see if they could embarrass Fox. They have since realised this was a major category error as nothing embarrasses Fox. Failure is his calling card. He is unapologetic for having been sacked for taking his mates on government business. Free the Freebie One.Nor does anyone enquire how the extension of the Brexit transition period would impact on the UK’s ability to sign trade deals. Mostly because such matters are well above Fox’s pay grade, but also because they know that whether Fox is forbidden or allowed to make deals is an entirely moot point. Nothing will happen either way. So MPs on both sides of the house restrict themselves to points of detail rather than wider government policy.Labour’s Madeleine Moon began by asking about the effects of US steel tariffs. Fox stifled a yawn. It was all rather complicated, he wasn’t sure he fully understood what was going on and it was all a bit boring anyway. But he was fairly confident it would all turn out OK in the end. And if it didn’t, then it would probably still be okayish. Did he think the US president was someone we could do business with? Absolutely, he replied. His confidence was touching.After insisting that the main result of Brexit would be for the EU to backslide on its own commitments to workers’ rights and environmental regulations, Fox moved on to his favourite subject. His holidays. He had just been to Johannesburg. The BA flat bed had been stunning and some of the wines had been out of this world. Oh, and he had also fitted in a Jaguar factory but had obviously done nothing hasty like making notes.From South Africa, we moved on to Australia and New Zealand. He’d had some fantastic trips, and discussions with both countries were ongoing, but he wouldn’t be going back there for a while as it was now their winter and it might be a bit cold and wet. One of the few countries Fox hadn’t been to was Israel – far too dangerous – but he was certain the UK had been entirely scrupulous in its sale of arms to the Israelis. It had come as a huge surprise that the Israelis had used their weapons and, besides, Britain couldn’t be held responsible for Palestinians deliberately throwing themselves in the way of bullets.Fox concluded that all was well with both the department and the world. Painstaking research had concluded that foreigners liked the fact that British people spoke English and he was delighted to announce that he had just supervised a change of font on the departmental website. “I’m going to Scotland this afternoon,” he declared. He didn’t seem to know why, though he was sure he would remember when he got there. And the hotel would be to die for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb1acca7331a74e8dbf9c062d1f69e4b9535cdc2/0_292_4413_2647/master/4413.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efb7415d1c06159698ef4033e5548f02","title":"theresa may tries to rally support for customs plan from eu leaders","story":"Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, warns that PM’s proposals could be insufficient to prevent hard border in IrelandA bold attempt by Theresa May to crack the Brexit impasse ran into trouble on Thursday as the Irish prime minister warned a new customs plan signed off by her warring ministers could be insufficient to avoid a hard border.The prime minister has persuaded reluctant Brexiters to agree to a plan to continue applying EU tariffs beyond the end of 2020, if no agreement has been reached to alleviate the need for border checks.May is now expected to deliver formal proposals within a couple of weeks, following a frantic day of diplomacy in the margins of an EU security conference that took her to Bulgaria and Macedonia.She sought to rally support from EU leaders for a new plan for the so-called “backstop”, which would kick in if no solution has been found to the challenge of avoiding a hard border. After a 45-minute bilateral, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, reported that he had seen “new thinking”. He said that he welcomed anything that would align all of the EU and the UK in terms of customs into the future. Brussels has made it clear that Ireland must be satisfied before any deal is accepted.But he suggested checks would still be required at the border if the UK left the single market.He said: “Any move on customs with the UK would be welcome but I need to be very clear that avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is about more than customs. The single market and aspects related to regulation are important as well.”On Tuesday, ministers on the Brexit committee agreed to a plan under which Britain would continue to levy EU tariffs, but retain the power to make its own free-trade agreements.On Thursday, May – with her chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins – had a series of meetings with the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the French president Emanuel Macron, and further meetings with the EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and the European council president Donald Tusk, as well as Varadkar.At a press conference in Skopje, Macedonia, at the end of the day, May confirmed she still intended to seek a UK-wide proposal that would avoid the need for the backstop to be invoked, and would take Britain out of the customs union.“We will be, in future, outside that customs union able to develop our own independent trade policy,” she said.It would mean as frictionless trade as possible, she insisted.But while her statement reiterated familiar pledges, it was also compatible with the latest proposal.At a press conference before boarding the plane to return to London, the prime minister said: “In December, when the joint report was published between the European Union and the United Kingdom, we set out clearly options in relation to the commitment that we have given for no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.“We expect that to be dealt with through the overall relationship we have with the European Union. But there were then two further levels of option, including the final fallback option.“The commission then published a fallback option which was not acceptable to to us. And we will be bringing forward our own proposal for that fallback option in due course.”EU sources said the prime minister was firmly told by Tusk, during a meeting that she personally requested, that Brussels and Dublin needed to see the concept on paper before they could give May any confidence about the June European council summit.The prime minister was said to appear anxious to know whether the proposal could lead to Brussels starting work on a political declaration about the future trading relationship with the UK.Varadkar had warned earlier at the summit in Sofia that, without substantial progress on the question of the Irish border, “we need to seriously question whether we’re going to have a withdrawal agreement at all”.The EU official said the meeting with Tusk had been about the UK’s “expectations in June”. He said: “We had to say it was too early to tell. All the news coming from London is very disorientating. Tusk was clear that it is not only about what the commission might recommend. “They have to get all 27 member states to agree, and that includes Ireland. And Tusk is squarely behind Dublin.”Varadkar later told reporters that, during 45 minutes of talks, May had sketched out her hopes for what he described as a “deep customs arrangement”, a phrase which will likely inflame Brexiters in the UK, who fear that their hopes of independent trade policy post-Brexit could be scotched.Varadkar said: “The prime minister gave me an insight into some new thinking that the UK government has in relation to customs, and obviously we’ll see how that develops, we haven’t seen any detail of that yet.“But certainly I think any move on customs which brings the UK closer to the EU is to be welcomed, but I very much emphasised that resolving the issue of a hard border requires more than customs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d/0_15_3619_2171/master/3619.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953007b5fda8a7c63da123b915bc8b19","title":"vote leave strategist dominic cummings refuses to appear before mps","story":"Snub raises questions over powers to compel reluctant witnesses to face committeesThe chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign has refused to appear in front of MPs, risking possible censure from the House of Commons but also raising questions about what more can be done when a witness ignores the will of parliament.Dominic Cummings, who has been credited as the brains behind the successful Brexit campaign, told the select committee investigating fake news that he would not be willing to answer questions in public before the Electoral Commission finishes its ongoing investigation into his campaign.The digital, culture, media and sport committee said this was not a valid excuse and issued a formal summons through parliament’s serjeant-at-arms, demanding that Cummings appear before it by the end of May. Cummings rejected this summons, angering MPs on the committee who wanted to ask questions about the use of Facebook data during the EU referendum campaign. The committee confirmed that Alexander Nix, the former boss of Cambridge Analytica, had accepted a formal summons to appear on 6 June.“We are disappointed that Dominic Cummings has not responded positively to our requests for him to appear,” said the committee’s chair, Damian Collins. “Reporting the matter to the house is a first step, which could result in a decision that a contempt of parliament has been committed, a very serious outcome for the inidual.”However, the refusal raises questions about the system of compelling reluctant witnesses to appear in front of parliament. It is the second time this week that a potential witness has turned down a formal summons to answer questions from MPs, after Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg turned down a request from the same committee.In theory, parliament has the power to issue fines or even threaten imprisonment for non-attendance. In reality, the system relies largely on consent, formal rebukes and the idea that iniduals can be shamed by the media into attending.Hannah White, of the Institute for Government, a thinktank, has previously said there are serious risks in issuing such summons if they are ignored. “Every time everyone observers the emperor has no clothes, in that parliament can’t force people to come, they lose a little bit of their authority.”Cummings, who will be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a forthcoming TV drama about Brexit, published a blog this week in which he explained his decision, saying lawyers had told him to “keep my trap shut” until the Electoral Commission completes its investigation into Vote Leave this summer. He said he had been willing to give evidence to the committee after this date, but the MPs’ decision to issue a formal summons via the media showed their priority was “grandstanding PR, not truth-seeking”.Cummings said he believed select committees should have the legal power to compel witnesses to attend. However, since no such law was in place, he said, he would not now give evidence “under any circumstances”. The committee system needed reforming to include “processes that push them towards truth-seeking behaviour rather than the usual trivialising grandstanding,” he said. “So far the inquiry on fake news has helped spread fake news across the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7716f7297d40829fd1422da5ca822323cfe0871e/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5690c1d43d65c4207f213d711454152b","title":"space tourism for the people become a virtual reality astronaut","story":"VR companies around the world are planning to offer live views of the Earth from space within the next few yearsIt’s the dream of any would-be space tourist: seeing our home planet from above. First you see the Earth’s horizon curve away, and then the luminous thin envelope of atmosphere that keeps us all alive comes into focus.As you cross the daylight side of Earth, you look down to see gigantic landscapes – mountains and valleys – beneath you. As your orbit continues, so night falls and the city lights turn on. Now you can see the human landscape of the planet. It is an experience said to be so profound that many astronauts say it permanently alters the way they think of the world and humanity. Psychologists now recognise this and call it the overview effect. No wonder then that a number of companies are vying to build rockets to take space tourists on the trip of a lifetime. But with the cost of even the cheapest tickets running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, it seems likely to be an experience most of us will be denied. Or does it? Now two UK-based companies have joined forces to offer the experience to virtually anyone. And the key word is virtual. Immersive content studio Rewind and the space industry experts at In-Space Missions have launched SpaceTime Enterprises. They plan to launch multiple satellites that will broadcast real-time immersive video of the entire Earth. To plug into this view, the only thing needed will be a set of virtual reality goggles. “We want it to become commonplace to ‘be’ in space because by being in space you actually connect with the planet,” says Doug Liddle, CEO of In-Space Missions. With £2.5m of funding in place, the first satellite is scheduled for launch in September 2019. It will carry cameras that can deliver images of the whole Earth at the same resolution that your eye could see from up there. So the first views when you strap on the VR goggles will be like looking out the window of the International Space Station, seeing what the satellite is currently flying over. As the company launches more satellites and increases its database, virtual reality will give way to augmented reality. “In three to five years we hope to offer views of anywhere on Earth in real time,” says Matt Vernon-Clinch of Rewind.  In this situation, users will no longer be tethered to the satellites instead, they will be able to fly around Earth and zoom in on areas of interest. This means the data could also be used for business and scientific applications. “You could track plastics in the ocean,” says Vernon-Clinch. “There are lots of environmental spin-outs. We will listen to our audience to see what they want.” Earth observation has certainly been one of the principal uses of satellites during the space age. Indeed, the ability to see the whole world and to take scientific measurements of it has spurred the environmental movement and now helps inform government policy because of concerns about climate change. Unsurprisingly, given the enormous potential for applications, SpaceTime Enterprises is not the only company planning to bring such views down to Earth.  San Francisco-based SpaceVR has already launched a test satellite, Overview 1, to the International Space Station. It is currently onboard, waiting to be deployed through a system called the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer.  UK-based firm Earth-i is also building a constellation of satellites to provide very high-resolution imagery of the Earth. Its VividX2 test satellite was launched on 12 January from India, and just a few weeks ago, the company posted its first colour videos from space, showing aircraft taxiing along runways and cars driving down highways.  Clearly the potential for this technology is extraordinary. “When we get this right, it will be everywhere,” says Sol Rogers, CEO and founder of Rewind.So prepare for a world in which almost any of us can see what used to be the privileged view of astronauts. And perhaps that leads to the most fascinating aspect of all of this. Will it change our attitude towards the world and its inhabitants as dramatically as it has done with astronauts? Does the overview effect rely on actually making the trip into space, or can it be activated using a virtual reality setup? If SpaceTime Enterprises and the other companies succeed in making these views as widely available as they hope, the world’s largest psychology experiment could be about to begin.Stuart Clark is the author of The Search for Earth’s Twin (Quercus)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1625d12d3bc76fec51862bbeaf8a625b32827fa0/0_318_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=588373413d7509b2467415b5156207b1","title":"93 year old golfer hole in one ben bender","story":"Ben Bender decided to go out on top.

He was rampant as of old, fit and fired again with ambition to crush all-comers on his favourite surface.Nadal won again in Rome on Thursday – easily – and then the communal gaze switched to Alex Zverev. On Sunday he beat Dominic Thiem, who had beaten Nadal in the Madrid quarter-finals two days earlier. Nobody could have predicted the struggle he would have in extending his run of victories to 11 as Britain’s No 1, Kyle Edmund, took him down to the wire in the third round of the Italian Open.They traded blows of breathtaking power, Edmund saving seven match points before Zverev eked out the most dramatic of wins, 7-5, 7-6 (11). He now has every chance of still being there on Sunday, probably against Nadal, to defend the title he won a year ago.Sunday’s final in Rome could be one to savour and Nadal, if he makes it, should have more in the tank than Zverev after dismissing Denis Shapovalov, 6-4, 6-1 in an hour and 22 minutes. But they are not the only actors in this play. Fabio Fognini, finally made the quarter-finals of his home tournament after beating the unseeded German, Peter Gojowczyk, 6-4, 6-4. His prize is … Nadal in the first match on Friday.The most thrills yesterday arrived when Zverev and Edmund brought their contrasting personalities together on the tournament’s glorious second court.Broken in the opening game, Edmund was back in business after several robust exchanges half an hour later, only to drop serve a second time. Zverev, whose serve frightens ballkids and dozing spectators, was banging them down at 128mph (207kph), 13mph faster than Edmund.Zverev, the world No 3, sealed the first set with a swinging ace down the T, his second, after 42 minutes.Edmund had to save three break points in the third game of the second set, but overcooked a crosscourt forehand. Zverev, getting ahead of himself, hit rashly on key points, then somehow rescued his serve for 3-1. Edmund would not lie down and, when his cause looked lost under a fusillade of booming serves, he doggedly got back to four-all.Two double-faults in the ninth game nearly scuppered his fightback but it was Zverev’s racket that was shaking more obviously and, after losing three games in a row, he found himself serving to stay in the set,With the court at his mercy on deuce, Edmund butchered a volley, but hung on to force set point as Zverev wobbled. Edmund made three astonishing gets in a row but could not reach Zverev’s clinching winner, and they were back on level terms. It was now a test of Edmund’s nerve and his serve. Both held.They went to the tie-break, where the drama intensified. Edmund saved for 11-all and a sixth match point. Zverev pushed him across the baseline for 12-11 and match point number seven. At the end of one final high-grade exchange, Edmund pushed a weary forehand just wide, and it was done.If they meet again in the French Open it would be reasonable to expect a repeat of these heroics. Both push themselves to the limit, Edmund with inscrutable calm, Zverev eyes bulging. Their rivalry is set. When Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray do leave the stage, they will have a pair of excellent understudies in place.Johanna Konta leaves Rome for Paris mildly encouraged but also perhaps concerned after blowing a first-set lead against a top-10 player for the fourth time in a row when tJelena Ostapenko won their engrossing third-round match.Konta, who has slipped to 22 in the world looked to have put her early-season torpor behind her as she sought to build on decent wins this week over Magdalena Rybarikova and Hsieh Su-wei. However on a mild, overcast morning and coughing from a heavy cold, she found the step up beyond her to lose 6-2, 3-6,4-6.Konta broke her fingernail (on her bag) then Ostapenko’s serve in a bizarre opening to their second Tour encounter. After a brief delay to repair the digit, she was blasting the fifth seed off the court, and looked to be within sight of an early finish as her opponent complained of dizziness.Ostapenko got her first break point at the start of the second set – and Konta survived four deuces, saving a second break point with her fourth ace in the longest struggle of the match – but the world No 6 powered on to level at a set apiece.She held to love to stay in the match but Ostapenko’s shaky serve stood up and the 20-year-old forced a final wayward forehand out of Konta after two and a quarter hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e43e581a5dff647c08a8f0528d5bff18e2f280da/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf688051f33b9c36ca9f1719df986365 700w","title":"how can i stop an unexpected windows 10 update","story":"Celia’s working day was almost ruined after she was caught out by an enforced update. Can she stop it happening again?Yesterday, I intended to take my laptop to visit a client, but when I was about to set off, yup, I couldn’t turn it off without allowing Microsoft to do its upgrades. We all know how long that takes, and I had a train to catch, so I ended up having to wing the whole presentation.The infuriating thing is that I knew there was an upgrade around, so I had checked the power settings that morning to see if one was waiting to be installed. There was no update at 9am. Somehow Microsoft snuck it in without my noticing.I do understand that people need to install updates, but can’t Microsoft give us an escape route? This is my computer and my software and my business, so please can you trust me, just this once? CeliaIt’s easy to be caught out by Windows updates, and I once left the house carrying an open laptop, confident that the update would finish long before the battery ran down.However, there is a fundamental ide between consumer and business versions of Windows. With consumer versions, such as Windows 10 Home, Microsoft takes a paternalistic view of updates: it tries to do what’s best for people who don’t know what they are doing. Business versions – Windows 10 Pro and the Enterprise and Education editions – are designed to allow IT departments and knowledgeable customers more control. That includes ways to defer some updates for a week, a month or even a year.Many update problems stem from business people using consumer version of Windows, and this is understandable for sole traders and companies that are too small to employ IT staff. I don’t even think the extra features in Windows 10 Pro – BitLocker, Hyper-V, Remote Desktop etc – would be much use to people in your position. However, it doesn’t cost much to upgrade, and could be worth it if being able to delay upgrades helped you win a new client.Otherwise, Microsoft has a Windows Update FAQ and a help page with a troubleshooter that you can download to help fix update problems.Laptops that are only used intermittently seem more likely to receive forced updates. Microsoft tries to download updates in the background without users being interrupted or even aware that it’s happening. If you have an always-on desktop PC, the process is almost completely reliable. If you use a laptop for intense work then shut it down when you stop, there aren’t many gaps for updates to be downloaded and installed. You can help by setting your laptop to stay awake for an hour or two while it’s charging.You can also pre-empt some inconvenient upgrades by looking for them.Set aside an hour each week to clean up your PC, tidy away files, check your backups and perhaps run an extra virus scan with something like Malwarebytes Free. During your housekeeping session, run the Settings (cogwheel) app, click “Update \u0026amp Security” and see if any updates are pending. If there are, you can either install them or click “Advanced options” and pick a time and date when you want them installed. If there aren’t, click the button that says “Check for updates” and see if it finds any.Your PC may appear to be up-to-date, but a search may find updates marked “pending install” or “pending restart”. After you’ve installed those, check again, because there may be even more updates to install. If you need a lot of updates, they tend to come in batches, not all at once.Pay particular attention after the second Tuesday of each month – “Patch Tuesday” – when Microsoft usually releases security fixes.Microsoft is updating almost 700m PCs running Windows 10, and it doesn’t try to update all of them at once. By checking for updates, you can jump the queue and install them at your preferred time, not when Microsoft’s update servers get around to it.When you have a restart pending, the Settings app provides two options: “Restart now” and “Schedule the restart”. Choose to schedule it and you can enter a date and time for the restart, which means you can put it off for up to six days.Also click on “Advanced options” on the same Settings screen, and select the last option: “We’ll show a reminder when we’re going to restart. If you want to see more notifications about restarting, turn this on.” Instead of simply restarting at the time you entered, Windows 10 will ask again, enabling you to delay it again.Windows 10 lets you set “Active hours” in the Windows Update section of the Settings app. Click on “Change active hours” to set the times when you usually use your PC. You can reserve 18 hours out of 24 for work. Microsoft will generally not update your PC during these times.If you are using your PC, you should get a “Heads up” notification to tell you that a restart is pending. You can either hit “Restart now” or “View settings” and select a time and date for the restart.I suspect that Microsoft did once restart my PC during my active hours, after I left it unattended for a couple of hours, so always save any work-in-progress beforehand. It takes less than a second to hit Ctrl-S.Microsoft knows that not everyone has unlimited broadband, so it allows for “metered connections”. By default, Windows 10 sets ethernet wired and wireless networks to non-metered, and mobile connections to metered. People who have capped broadband and unlimited mobile broadband could switch these around, but the defaults suit most users.If you have a metered connection, Windows Update will only download priority updates automatically, so it will be up to you to download the others. Setting both connections to metered will limit the amount of data Microsoft downloads, making you less likely to get a major update when you don’t expect one.To set metered connections, run the Settings app, click on “Network \u0026amp Internet” and then select “Change connection properties”.Frankly, I don’t think setting metered connections offers enough benefits to be worth the effort, but some people may find it useful.The business and professional versions of Windows 10 provide more control, even to people who are not IT experts. For example, the advanced options page in the Settings app includes an extra control, Pause Updates. This prevents any updates from being installed for the next week, though when the time is up, you cannot pause it again.If you have Windows 10 Pro, this is the simplest solution to the Windows update problem. You can simply install all available updates on (say) a Sunday then pause updates during your working week.The business versions of Windows also include Group Policies, which allow IT managers to control how their fleets of PCs work. However, you can edit them manually. Type edit group policy in the Windows search box and run the editor (gpedit.msc), then look for Windows Update in the Administrative Templates section, under Computer Configuration. The default setting is “3 – Download the updates automatically and notify when they are ready to be installed”. You can change it to “2 – Notify for download and notify for install”. That will reduce the chances of Windows 10 installing downloads when you’re not ready for them.GPEdit also allows you to defer “quality updates” for up to 30 days, and “feature updates” for up to 365 days. This is useful for businesses that need to test applications before installing updates. It doesn’t prevent your PC from restarting to install security updates, but usually this doesn’t take very long.Windows geeks know that you can do all sorts of things with its Administrative Tools. For example, double-click Services, and find Windows Update in the list. Yes, you can control how this service starts up, and you can stop it from running until you next reboot Windows. People shouldn’t mess with Services unless they know what they are doing. However, a small utility called Winaero Tweaker provides easy access to all sorts of tweaks, one of which is Disable Windows 10 Updates. This is not something I recommend, but there are times when it could be a useful short-term expedient.At least Winaero Tweaker is safer than people changing Services or editing the Windows registry directly, where ignorance can lead to unfortunate results.Have you got a question?

John Tarson, who operates Epic Lava Tours, is an early-riser and said he only learned about the eruption because he received an alert on his phone.Tarson said the ash plume looked different than others he has witnessed because of its sheer height. A video he shared on Facebook showed a towering column of ash reaching into a hazy sky.“What I noticed is the plume was just rising straight into the air, and it was not tipping in any direction,” he said.“We’ve been expecting this, and a lot of people are going to see it and get excited and scared,” he added.Authorities cautioned that wind could carry the ash as far as Hilo. The National Weather Service issued an ash advisory until noon. Several schools closed because of the risk of elevated levels of sulfur dioxide, a volcanic gas.Robert Hughes owns the Aloha Junction Bed and Breakfast, about a mile and a half from the crater. He said he did not hear anything either and is in an area that did not get any ash.So far, he said, Thursday has been a “nice rainy day”.His business has been hit hard by fears of the volcano, once an attraction for visitors. He said he’s lost hundreds of reservations and had just three guests Thursday instead of the 12 to 14 he has typically served.One of the guests was a news reporter. The other two were from Italy.“In the old days, people used to love to come see the volcano. They’d even take their little postcards, burn one corner in the lava flow, mail then off, stuff like that,” he said. “Now they’re acting like it’s all super-dangerous and everything, but it just kind oozes out.”The crater sits within Hawaii Volcanoes national park, which has been closed since 11 May because of the risk of a more violent eruption.Officials have said the eruption is not likely to be dangerous as long as people stay out of the closed park.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. An eruption in 1924 killed one person and sent rocks, ash and dust into the air for 17 days.Scientists warned on 9 May that a drop in the lava lake at the summit might create conditions for an explosion that could fling ash and refrigerator-sized boulders into the air.Geologists predicted such a blast would mostly release trapped steam from flash-heated groundwater. Communities a mile or two away could be showered by pea-size fragments or dusted with non-toxic ash, they said.The volcano has been erupting continuously since 1983. It is one of five volcanoes on Hawaii’s Big Island, and the only one currently erupting.

Everyone is welcome.Inside, in a study bathed by the afternoon sunshine, Wael Hussein, a 24-year-old gay man, is chatting with Naya, a transgender woman, ahead of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOTB) on Thursday. Behind the two is a bookcase filled with donated titles, including Les Amantes by French lesbian writer Jocelyne François. “This is my other home, I consider people here as my family,” says Wael. “Many come to find friends – outside, they find it difficult to be accepted.” Compared with other countries in the Middle East, such as Iran where homosexuality is punishable by death, Lebanon has a relatively thriving LGBT community. During a recent dinner at Em Nazih, a trendy cafe in Beirut’s Gemmayze district, stereos blared the indie rock band Mashrou’ Leila, whose frontman is Muslim and openly gay.But life is not without its hazards. On Wednesday Hadi Damien, the organiser of Beirut Pride, the only event of its kind in the Arab world, announced the festival had been suspended after authorities interrogated him and threatened him with prosecution. A roster of events that would have featured poetry readings, a storytelling night and a talk on sexual health had been cancelled, he said.For those still facing discrimination, obstruction, and even violence, Helem is a lifeline. “I’ve been coming here for a year now. I’m alone and I come here to talk to people,” says Suzy, a 41-year-old trans woman with a bruised left eye sitting on the organisation’s balcony. “Two weeks ago, I was in the disco. Two people riding on a motorbike stopped and punched me in the eye, stole my bag, money and my phone.”Wael joined Helem (which means “dream” in Arabic) two and half years ago as a volunteer before becoming one of only three paid staff seven months ago. He is a case worker, dealing mainly with those who have fallen foul of Lebanon’s infamous article 534, which criminalises “unnatural sexual acts”.In his bag he now carries a mobile phone that serves as a 24-hour emergency hotline. But the work is not all about crises. Wael also runs makeup workshops. “Some people have just found out about their gender identity, and they are intrigued to use makeup to intensify it, like trans women,” he says. “It makes me smile. When they see themselves in the mirror, their eyes start shining and what they can see in the mirror, they feel this person looks much more like the way they see themselves.”Helem was set up as an underground movement nearly 20 years ago and, despite never having received official registration by the authorities, has clung to life. The authorities neither rejected nor approved the request, said Genwa Samhat, Helem’s executive director, in a sign that meant “‘we won’t reject you but we will make your work really hard that you’d eventually stop’. But on the contrary we just kept on working.”Since then Helem’s reputation has spread beyond Lebanon throughout the Arab world and several similar organisations have been set up, including the NGO Shams in Tunisia, fighting for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Afsaneh Rigot of British human rights group Article 19 said Helem was “an important and necessary LGBTQ oasis in the Middle East and North Africa region” and “a refuge for some of the most marginalised people in Lebanon”. But progress has not been straightforward. When Samhat, 31, joined four years ago, the organisation was almost moribund. Her arrival coincided with a Lebanese security forces raid on a local bathhouse, the Hammam al-Agha, which resulted in the arrests of 36 people.“When I joined, it was a trial to see if things would work again or not. Helem had lost its community centre, its offices, all of its funds. It had zero dollars in its bank account,” says Samhat. “It felt impossible at one point to get this going again, but with the Hammam Agha raid it was my first incident with such an arrest file … and it was a major push to try to do something about it.”Most of the people rounded up in the raid were sent to the Hbeish detention centre, and Helem’s ensuing work highlighted torture there. Such physical mistreatment appears now to have stopped. Today, at least 17 people are detained in Hbeish, mostly transgender people.“Trans people face the most discrimination – they’re visible,” Samhat said. “They were mostly arresting trans women who never ever got the opportunity to find a job, who were kicked out of their family houses, they were homeless for a long period of time, who actually dropped out of school because they were bullied at some point. We believe in personal freedoms and if people choose to be sex workers, it’s their right and we will defend them, but we do have to realise a lot of people do it out of survival reasons.”Naya, 21, heads Helem’s seven-member trans committee and says it is serving as an umbrella that makes people like her “feel stronger and let us make things we couldn’t do before – like offering hormones”. The organisation also provides more essential help. Aside from the study, there are places to sleep, a bathroom and a kitchen with basic appliances – a fridge, a gas stove and a washing machine. Its sister organisation, the sexual health clinic Marsa, provides free HIV tests, and charges $100 (£74) for comprehensive screening including for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Nearly 260 people visit Marsa each month – of whom two or three on average test positive for HIV. Back at Helem, Joseph Aoun, 33, is busy working on Helem’s campaigning week before IDAHOTB. He used to be the manager of Bardo, Beirut’s most famous gay bar, before joining Helem, an experience he says has opened his eyes to the discrimination faced by those from deprived social backgrounds.“It’s a constant struggle against the odds,” he says. “You have a lot of frustration but when you look back you see you’re impacting people’s lives and this is beautiful.”This year, IDAHOTB coincides with Ramadan, and Dana Darwish, a transgender lesbian, plans to go to Helem for iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily fast during the holy month. “Islam is the religion of peace,” said the 31-year-old. “Helem makes iftar every week and it’s a wonderful feeling that this year Ramadan falls on the same day as IDAHOTB.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb5945a445d613daa0ae99047ee1a45723aae1a/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0265e93ed2a651eb4521633e238f956a","title":"italys m5s and league parties poised to sign government deal","story":"Tremors emerge in EU after draft plan seeks debt wipeout from Europe’s central bankItaly’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and its far-right partner, the League, appeared to be on the verge of signing a government deal on Thursday after overcoming outstanding isive issues. However, they gave no hint over which party would lead the alliance.Luigi Di Maio, the leader of M5S, emerged from a meeting with the League’s counterpart Matteo Salvini saying a pact could be sealed by Thursday evening.“I think we will close the contract this evening,” he said. “This afternoon we will get contributions that will allow us to adjust the document for style and technicality.”On the question of prime minister, he said: “We are still working that out”. Both leaders said the final policy document would be put to their voters before being submitted to the president, Sergio Mattarella, who has the final say on the contract, prime minister and cabinet lineup.There were tremors across Europe on Wednesday after a draft of their plan published by Huffington Post Italy revealed proposals to ask the European central bank to wipe out €250bn of debt as well as set up procedures allowing EU member states to exit the euro.Di Maio referred to the early draft as being “just notes”. Plans to leave the euro appear to have been dropped while the latest accord could see them instead seek a “debt discount”. Other policies reported to have made it into the latest version include a pledge to withdraw sanctions against Russia and an attempt to renegotiate EU treaties, including the Dublin accord on asylum seekers, while upping the expulsion of illegal immigrants.Immigration appeared to be the sticking point between the two parties earlier this week, with Salvini saying he wanted his party to have a free rein at cracking down on “the business” of illegal immigration and that the new administration would only begin “if it can do things”.The 45-year-old went one step further on Wednesday and pledged to scrap the previous administration’s “€50bn migration reception” policy.The contract reportedly stipulates that unregistered Roma camps should be shut down religious leaders should be registered with the state and services conducted in Italian and the funding of mosques and other religious centres should be traceable.The parties plan to build more prisons and hire up to 10 thousand new police officers. Di Maio, 31, said earlier this week that tax evaders would be jailed.Other policies are said to include overhauling parliament and giving more autonomy and funding to the regions, as well as a funding pact intended to “bring dignity back to Rome” in a bid to resolve the capital’s long-running administrative issues.Despite doubts over their unlikely union, Di Maio and Salvini became more emboldened to strike a deal after warnings from the European commission against the formation of a government that would disregard the bloc’s stability and growth pact or jeopardise Italy’s migrant policy.They were particularly irked by a piece on Tuesday in the Financial Times whose headline described them as “modern barbarians”. “It’s better to be a barbarian than a slave that sells Italy’s dignity, future, businesses and borders,” Salvini said in a video on Facebook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8c54810a697676875efade3949cf451b83cbb2/274_0_3224_1936/master/3224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f941326df8d85e950f7f18c8e4ddb838","title":"maersk tankers pull out of iran in blow to nuclear deal","story":"European leaders to launch statute to protect EU firms doing business in IranThe EU has put itself on a collision course with the US over Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran, as major European firms started to pull out of the country to avoid being hit by sanctions.In an attempt to shield EU companies doing business with Iran, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he would turn to a plan last used to protect businesses working in Cuba before a US trade embargo was lifted on the Latin American country.The EU is seeking to keep Iran in the 2015 accord by safeguarding the economic benefits Tehran gained in return for giving up its nuclear programme.The “blocking statute” is a 1996 regulation that prohibits EU companies and courts from complying with foreign sanctions laws and stipulates that no foreign court judgments based on these laws have any effect in the EU.The European Investment Bank will also provide a funding stream for businesses working in Iran.Juncker said: “The effects of the US sanctions will be felt. It is the duty of the EU therefore to protect European business and that applies particularly to smaller and medium-size businesses.”The European council president, Donald Tusk, added at a meeting of EU leaders: “We agreed unanimously that the EU will stay in the agreement as long as Iran remains fully committed to it. Additionally the commission was given a green light to be ready to act whenever European interests are affected.”Tusk, who accused Trump’s administration of “capricious assertiveness” earlier in the week, told reporters: “The problem is if your closest friend is unpredictable. It is not a joke now. This is the essence of our problem now with our friends on the other side of the Atlantic. I can agree with President Trump when he said unpredictability can be a very useful tool in politics. But only against enemies and opponents. Unpredictability is the last thing we need with friends and family.”Despite the tough diplomatic rhetoric, however, the chances of the Iran nuclear deal surviving the impact of US sanctions were dealt a blow when the Danish shipping group A P Moller-Maersk said it was joining an exodus of companies ceasing commercial activity in Iran.Maersk, the world’s largest oil shipping container firm, said on Thursday it would honour customer agreements entered into before 8 May, but then wind them down by 4 November, as required by the reimposed US sanctions.Iran’s oil exports were at 1m barrels a day, mostly to Asia and some European countries, before sanctions were lifted. They subsequently climbed to 2.5m barrels.Maersk operates more than 160 vessels and employs 3,100 people worldwide with a turnover of $836m in 2016.The speed at which firms operating in Iran are pulling out is threatening to wreck EU leaders’ plans to provide legal and financial guarantees to protect European firms that keep trading with Iran. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, admitted that the EU was limited in what it could do.She said: “We can see whether we can give small and medium-sized companies certain relief. That is being examined ... As for compensating all businesses in a comprehensive way for such measures by the United States of America, I think we cannot and must not create illusions.”Commenting on the Total decision, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “We’re not going to force French businesses to stay in Iran. The president of the French republic is not the CEO of Total.” The Iranian government has warned that any exodus of EU investment would force it to pull out of the nuclear deal preventing it from enriching uranium.The heart of the Iran deal – which Trump branded “horrible” as he pulled out of it earlier this month – was an Iranian commitment to end its nuclear programme in return for greater trade with the west.The danger is that the dispute over Iran will spill into a wider row between the EU and US over trade, and events will gather their own momentum as the US starts to impose sanctions on key Iranian figures.In a bid to keep the dispute from spiralling out of control, EU political ambassadors travelled to New York and Washington to urge the US to give carve-outs to EU firms from its sanctions policy. They are also warning the US administration that economic chaos imposed on Iran will be counter-productive, and is more likely to strengthen hardliners than lead to a regime change of benefit to the west.Günther Oettinger, the EU budget commissioner, urged the EU to remain united. “One thing is very clear to me: Trump despises weaklings,” he said.

Leaked drafts of their government “contract” include provision for a “conciliation committee” to settle expected disagreements.Mainly it looks alarming. Both parties toned down their fiercest anti-EU rhetoric during the election campaign, dropping previous calls for a referendum on eurozone membership (popular votes on international treaties are, in any case, barred by the Italian constitution). But as they approach power, the historical Euroscepticism of the M5S and the League is resurfacing. An incendiary early version of their accord called for the renegotiation of EU treaties, the creation of a euro opt-out mechanism, a reduction in Italy’s contribution to the EU budget and the cancellation of €250bn (£219bn) of Italian government debt.The parties’ leaders, Luigi Di Maio of M5S and Matteo Salvini of the League (who counts the likes of Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orbán as his allies), were quick to say this leak was premature, and a later version of their contract showed the section on Europe had been much watered down.The euro opt-out had gone, and calls for changes to EU treaties and monetary policy were marked in red, meaning they are yet to be agreed. But the draft still urged a debate on the EU’s stability and growth pact, greater powers for the European parliament, a denunciation of austerity policies and the repatriation of “certain EU competences” to member states.The general tenor certainly suggests the new government will not back down from its belief that – in the words of one senior League official, Lorenzo Fontana – “people come before economic obligations”. Complaining about “unelected Eurocrats”, M5S’s Di Maio said it was time for Italy to “show courage … and change things”.The coalition could also fall out with Brussels over its plans for a clampdown on immigration and a call to cancel all economic sanctions on Russia. But of far greater concern in EU capitals are a raft of tax-cutting, welfare-boosting and budget-busting economic and social policies that could spell serious trouble in the eurozone.Economists and the Italian media have costed the agreed M5S-League policy programme at between €65bn and €100bn. And the two parties have repeatedly said they feel no need to respect European commitments in implementing their programme.Fed up with the country’s long, seemingly irreversible economic decline, persistent high unemployment, and a refugee and migrant crisis, Italy’s voters turned on the political centre that has governed (or failed to govern) Italy since the 1980s.But some analysts fear that if the radical new government they elected does push ahead with its promised policies, the result could be a Greek-style banking and debt crisis in the eurozone’s third-largest economy.Europe’s, and especially the eurozone’s, biggest fear is that Italy plunges into the kind of economic meltdown that eventually came very close to catapulting Greece – by that stage led, remember, by a radical-left government that was hellbent on overthrowing the eurozone’s rules – out of the single currency in 2015.The parallel is far from perfect, and neither M5S nor the League seem to be spoiling for the kind of fight that Syriza once sought. But the EU could most certainly do without a Greek-style crisis on an Italian scale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21bc8e6081bc164452172624104242aae8005123/48_10_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df710078fa594df5ef2faa69aaa2a55","title":"revealed how storyful uses tool monitor what journalists watch","story":"News Corp subsidiary’s news verification plugin also used to monitor users’ social media browsingSoftware developed by a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp to help journalists verify content on social media is also being used to monitor the videos and images viewed by reporters who use the tool.In 2016, journalists were encouraged to install a Storyful web browser extension called Verify that informs users when videos or images have been verified and cleared for use by the company’s in-house journalists. But the  has established that data acquired through the Verify plugin is also being used by Storyful to actively monitor what its clients are seeing on social media. The incoming social media browsing data has been turned into an internal feed at the company that updates in real time.More than 40 Storyful employees, including journalists, editors and senior executives at the company’s offices in Dublin, London, New York and Sydney, have been granted access to the feed, providing them with a window into what other journalists are looking at on social media. has obtained a recording of the feed, which is a purpose-built channel in Slack, a commonly used office software. The channel, called #verify-notifications, displays a constantly updated list of videos and pictures being viewed on social media. Over a four-hour period, more than 200 videos and photos are shown, beside the notification: “New item viewed by client.”Two former Storyful insiders, who spoke to the  on condition of anonymity, described how the feed was considered a resource that could be mined by journalists at the company looking for newsworthy, viral or monetisable social media content that is first spotted by clients.“In my opinion it is tremendously wrong that this is going on,” one said, adding that journalists who have installed the software may have no idea their browsing activity is being monitored in this way. Storyful strongly disputed that, insisting it made “clear disclosures” about how the extension works. “The data that Verify collects appears in an internal Slack channel called #verify-notifications,” it said in a statement. “Links flow into the Slack channel with no personal data that identifies the user who is viewing the content.” The company said the purpose of the channel was to “improve the user experience in order to serve our customers better”.It said any allegation that the tool constituted a data breach or amounted to spying was “factually wrong and defamatory” and said: “We take privacy matters very seriously, we collect all data responsibly, and we are transparent in the way we use that data.”Storyful, which was acquired by News Corp in 2013, uses its own team of journalists to verify material that appears on social media, from YouTube videos of military attacks in Syria to videos of pets posted to Facebook.The Verify extension, which was launched in November 2016, was billed as a tool to streamline that process, providing what Storyful called “a one-click analysis of any piece of content on the social web”. Both the  and Reuters are understood to have previously used Storyful, which lists the BBC and Google as other clients on its website. It is not known whether journalists at any of these technology or media companies installed the Verify plugin, but the Chrome webstore suggests it has about 500 users.Once a user has installed Verify and logged into a Storyful account provided by their employer, they see a green or red signal depending on whether the content accessed on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vimeo or YouTube is on Storyful’s Newswire of content that has been cleared for use. Verify also has a button clients can use to voluntarily send content to Storyful that they would like the company to investigate content.The hunt for newsworthy social media content has spawned a competitive industry, and there is often a race among reporters to find, validate and seek permission to use videos posted to Twitter and YouTube. Viral clips can be highly valuable, and in recent years Storyful and other companies have also begun licensing social media content, charging for its use and then sharing the revenue with whoever captured the image or video. By using the Verify extension to automatically collect and monitor content other journalists are looking at on social media, Storyful can spot potentially lucrative videos and pictures that have been discovered by other reporters. One of the former Storyful employees who spoke to the  said it was considered as “a huge gain for the editorial team”, who were encouraged to monitor the channel in search of videos that could be valuable to the company. The source said they did not use the feed personally but they were given a detailed briefing on how it would be used. “It was all about the edge and seeing what people were watching across YouTube, Facebook and Twitter,” they said.The second former Storyful employee said they occasionally used the feed to search for videos or photos that might be of interest to the company, adding: “All that was explained to me is that it would make it easier for us to see what our clients were watching.” Asked if they felt they were spying on other reporters, they replied: “Yes. We were sort of spying on them to see what they were seeing. I don’t know if they knew that we were doing it.”A major problem with the feed, both of the former employees said, was that it did not distinguish between content viewed by a client for work and personal browsing content. “A lot of it was personal videos,” the second former employee said, recalling how the feed was full of people watching The Simpsons.The recording obtained by the  appears to confirm that. While it did contain photos and videos that might be of interest to media outlets, such as animal videos posted to Instagram and Facebook videos of extreme weather events, those were drowned out by what looked like a cascade of personal web browsing.The feed included YouTube clips of Charlotte Church, ITV’s This Morning, Thunderbirds and Star Wars, as well as several Instagram and Facebook photos that appeared unconnected to work. Also them were Facebook photos of the wedding of a journalist whose employer has a contract with Storyful. The images appear to have been pulled into the feed after the groom’s colleague, who installed Storyful, perused his public photo album. In a statement, Storyful said it did not have access “to posts marked as private on any platform” and said it was also “patently obvious” in a user’s browser when the Verify tool was active. “Clear disclosures relating to privacy and the functionality of the tool are given to all Newswire users that opt to install the Verify extension prior to installation,” it said.When users install the Verify extension, they are shown a link to the company’s privacy policy, which explains how it uses data but makes no mention of the plugin.

However, if any further proof was needed of the west’s destructive love affair with the car, the furious reaction to a pilot project in one of the Netherlands’ biggest cities has been all too telling.Streets have been ided, angry complaints made and Walter Dresscher, the organiser of the council-backed scheme in The Hague, given what he admits was a verbal going-over during a fiery public meeting. However, Dresscher’s determination remains undimmed: “We can’t go on like this. This has been a great success already because people are thinking.”The drama was sparked by the Dutch municipality’s proposal to residents in six streets in Segbroek, a suburb in the west of the city, to voluntarily swap their parking permit for six months and replace it with something green and pleasant on their street.Their vehicles would be stored in a car park for free, and those participating could choose between themselves how to use the vacant space.Dresscher, an architect by training, said opposition from many residents in the selected areas illustrated how deeply people were attached to their cars, even in the Netherlands, which is often a pioneer in terms of green transportation. The idea of a parking space being lost from a street was too much for some to bear.“I was a bit like a boxing guy, I took everything,” he said of the public meeting attended by 200 residents. “If I was to respond, like I would in a personal conversation, the meeting would not have finished very well ... Everybody took – and this in the Netherlands is more rare than in other countries – very opposite positions. Normally, we are a country where we have a dialogue, we talk to each other.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“The idea was to get people together but it didn’t. Why? If there is one that is very angry and starts mobilising the whole street then you have a problem.“But if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But physically a car is getting out of the street. Nobody is losing anything.”Dresscher insisted the initial hostility has abated but, as yet, only six householders have signed up to the scheme, with their cars due to be removed in June. Two residents have, however, pre-empted the scheme by putting flower-filled tow-carts in front of their homes, much to the irritation of some. Drivers have been known to shout abuse as they drive by.Dresscher, who has €60,000 of funding from the council and charities, is still confident that more people will come round to his thinking, and is glad that a debate has been started.Rembrant Frerichs, 40, and, Wolfert Brederode, 44, both pianists, and neighbours on Newtonstreet, said they believed it was an important first step in changing the nature of their road, but were yet to decide how to use the space in front of their homes.Brederode said: “I just don’t think I need the car outside my house all the time and I’m going to see if we need it at all. I don’t think there is any reason.“People have this belief that they have a right to have a car, a right to have a parking space. A car is like a second home to people but it isn’t rational.”Dresscher said the project had been inspired by the experience of being forced to push his baby’s pram on the road when living in Amsterdam because cars were blocking the pavement.“I looked at these cars and there were actually plants growing under them. They hadn’t moved for three or four weeks. I started thinking: does anyone know how many cars are used or not?”“This is a completely ridiculous situation,” he said. “I want to get rid of unused cars. The municipalities of Netherlands cannot keep going like this. One day they will come and take away that right, I am sure about that. But this is chance for people to change their behaviour themselves.”A spokesman for The Hague municipality said: “People get the opportunity to choose themselves what they want to do with the public space. They can park their cars in the street or start sharing cars and fill up the free parking spots for other purposes like green, bicycle parking or picnic tables. “We want to see the effect of this approach. Will this bottom-up approach work, where people get a direct effect of their choice to get rid of their car, or is it still necessary to make top-down policy to manage the amount of parked cars in public spaces? It’s a project that, when it succeeds, can easily be scaled up to other streets and neighbourhoods. We think that’s why this pilot is worth funding.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Photograph: James Connolly  Anti-abortion campaigners who erected a giant “No” slogan on Ben Bulben mountain in Co Sligo insisted on Thursday that they had not broken the law.Those who erected the lettering described it as a “cry from the mountain to save Ireland’s babies”, and said it would remain in place until after the referendum on the eighth amendment.The National Parks and Wildlife Service has called for the removal of the sign saying the installation of “alien materials such as this onto a special area of conservation is insensitive to its conservation status and incompatible with the habitat”.“The owners should procure its immediate removal so that Ben Bulben is returned undamaged to its natural and beloved state,” the agency added.Sligo County Council has confirmed its planning enforcement section is investigating the matter, having received a number of complaints.An Taisce said it was one of those to make a formal complaint.“As the mountain is part of a sensitive rural landscape in a visually vulnerable and surrounded by scenic routes, all designated under the Sligo County Development Plan 2017-2023, there is a requirement to obtain planning permission and no exemptions apply,” the heritage group said.Many local people strongly criticised the erection of the sign, saying those responsible had defaced the mountain and caused embarassement for those trying to promote the north west.But groups campaigning for a No vote locally said the action reflected frustration over a perceived lack of balance in the media.Tommy Banks one of those involved in erecting the slogan said about 20 people involved in the operation had been on the mountain from 4am on Thursday carrying out what he described as a “mammoth task” .He estimated that the letters were 160 feet high and said they were made from plastic cladding. Mr Banks said they had permission from all the land owners and had been helped by “men of all ages, and women as well, down making tea and sandwiches”.In the 1970s and 1980s “Brits Out” and “H Block” slogans were painted on the mountain which was immortalised by WB Yeats.Mr Banks told Ocean FM that the operation was “well planned and well executed” . He claimed that the Government was “planning to execute the future children of Ireland” and were were not listening to the people.Fiona Candon, president of Sligo Chamber of Commerce expressed her disgust at the development. “It is terrible that our beautiful iconic Ben Bulben is being shown in such a light today”, she said. Ms Candon said the issue was not whether it was Yes or No campaigners , but that the mountain was being used negatively in such a way.Susan O’Keeffe Director of the Yeats Society said it was not appropriate that “the natural landscape” be used in such a way by any lobby group. Sligo business man Finbarr Filan, a former general election candidate for Renua who has been campaigning for a No vote , said he believed those responsible had acted out of frustration as they were “not getting a fair crack in the media”.Mr Filan said a lot of No posters, including some of his own, had been tampered with or removed and he said that following the recent Google decision not to run referendum ads , there was a sense of frustration. Gardaí said that, as no formal complaint had been in received in connection with the incident, it was not being investigated. A spokeswoman took issue with suggestions that gardaí would be protecting the slogan. Sile Quinlan spokesperson for Love Both in Sligo said that she understood those responsible were people who were very concerned “about what we are being asked to vote for – the removal of protection for the unborn”. Stressing that she did not speak for those responsible, she said her understanding was that it was a temporary measure and would not leave any permanent mark on the landscape.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3497939.1526501307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times poll repeal has large but reduced lead","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe latest ‘’Ipsos MRBI poll finds once the undecideds and those who will not vote are excluded, the Yes side leads by 58 per cent to 42 per centThe Yes side retains a clear advantage in the abortion referendum campaign, but its lead has reduced sharply in the last month, the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll has found.Asked how they will vote in the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment, 44 per cent of voters now say they will vote in favour of the proposal, a decline of three points since the last poll in late April.The No vote is at 32 per cent, an increase of four points, while 17 per cent are undecided (a decline of three points). Seven per cent said they will not vote or refused to say.Once the undecideds and those who will not vote are excluded, the Yes side leads by 58 per cent to 42 per cent, with just over a week to go before polling day.While this shows a decline of 10 points in the Yes lead since late April, those in favour of repeal still command a 16-point lead as the campaign enters its final, decisive stage.A tightening of the race was expected by all sides as polling day approaches, and pollsters say that process is likely to continue in the days ahead. But while the Yes side lead has been cut, the No side requires a dramatic acceleration of that process if it is to secure a majority on May 25th.Dublin remains the most pro-repeal part of the country, with the Yes side leading in the capital by 68 per cent to 32 per cent, once undecideds and unlikely voters are excluded.The Yes lead is smaller but clear in the rest of Leinster and Munster, while the two sides are almost tied in Connacht-Ulster, with 51 per cent of declared likely voters saying they will vote Yes and 49 per cent backing the No side.Younger voters are much more likely to support the Yes side, though the youngest cohort of voters (18-24 year-olds) shows a sharp drop in Yes supports in the last month. Voters aged over 50 are in favour of retaining the Eighth Amendment.Women, urban voters, and those from wealthier backgrounds are more in favour of repeal, while farmers and those from the poorest households have small No majorities.The poll shows that a significant minority of declared Yes voters believe that the Government’s proposal for legalising abortion “goes too far”, while 47 per cent of all voters say the law needs to be changed, but 12 weeks is too far.However, many of those voters still intend to vote in favour of the referendum proposal. Over half of all voters (54 per cent) say that while they have reservations about the 12-weeks proposal, they believe it is a “reasonable compromise”. Just over a third of voters (35 per cent) disagree.The poll also shows that voters are becoming more certain of their choice as polling day approaches. Two-thirds of Yes voters say they will absolutely not change their minds, while a further 23 per cent say they are “extremely unlikely” to change their minds. A further 9 per cent say they will probably not change their minds.Certainty is also growing on the No side, with 85 per cent of voters absolutely or extremely unlikely to change their mind. A further 9 per cent will probably not change their minds.Among those who have yet to decide, more undecided voters are leaning towards Yes (31 per cent) than No (24 per cent), though most say they are not leaning in either direction.The poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week in face-to-face interviews among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 eligible voters. Interviewing took place at 120 sampling points across all constituencies. The accuracy level is estimated to be about plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3498859.1526556384!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"poll results show no room for complacency says harris","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris.

It is adding more pain and trauma to people in crisis pregnancies.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillFormer Irish diplomat Ray Bassett has told a meeting at Westminster that the Government and the EU should drop their demand for a backstop agreement on the Border ahead of next month’s European Union summit in Brussels.“I think the backstop should be dropped because the backstop can never be put into effect. It is being used as a threat. I have met nobody in Dublin who believes that the backstop will be implemented,” he said.“It’s not reality. There is no British government that could agree to that. There is complete silence from British politicians about this. I’ve heard nobody support the backstop.”Dr Bassett was speaking at the launch of his pamphlet Brexit and the Border: Where Ireland’s True Interests Lie, which is published by the Politeia think tank.The DUP’s Brexit spokesman at Westminster Sammy Wilson suggested that, if the backstop demand could not be abandoned, it should be put on ice until later in the negotiations.“I can understand from a political point of view why, having nailed their colours so firmly to the backstop mast that it is difficult for politicians to step down. And neither Leo Varadkar nor Simon Coveney are the kind of politicians who will step down easily,” he said.“I think the best we can hope for is that rather than insisting that this must go into legal language before June, it is simply left until the negotiations are completed. Because I believe that by completing the negotiations and getting a free trade agreement, many of the requirements around the backstop would disappear anyhow. That allows all the options to be explored.”Dr Bassett said Dublin was bluffing in its approach to Brexit and that the British government should make clear that Theresa May’s red lines are not negotiable.“I think the Irish Government is involved in a game of bluff. I think that they’re totally convinced that the UK is going to come in and say OK to going into the single market and the customs union. It’s all predicated on that and you have to get across to them that this is not going to occur,” he said.Asked at an EU summit in Sofia, Bulgaria about reports that London would ask to stay in the European Union’s customs area beyond the end of a post-Brexit transition period in 2020, Ms May denied she was “climbing down” on plans to leave.“No. The United Kingdom will be leaving the customs union as we’re leaving the European Union. Of course, we will be negotiating future customs arrangements with the European Union and I’ve set three objectives,” she told reporters.She said the objectives were that Britain should have its own trade policy with the rest of the world, should have frictionless trade with the EU and that there would be no hard border in Ireland.In talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk, Ms May reiterated her view that a backstop agreement put forward by Brussels to prevent a hard border was unacceptable.“The prime minister said the UK would shortly put forward its own backstop proposal in relation to customs,” her spokeswoman said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding countdown pictures prince harry meghan markles","story":"With the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle just a couple of days away, the excitement is mounting.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend the Wedding rehearsal in Windsor.Eddie Mulholland for The Polio could be wiped out within a yearWhat to expect from the Royal weddingCancer patients waiting up to 18 months for NHS treatment Million Pound Menu review – a daft hodge-podge of recent reality show formats Humans, series 3, review – riveting sci-fi that isn’t really about the robotsMultiple deaths after school bus collides with dump truck in New JerseyInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingDuke and Duchess of Sussex?

Ms Haspel, an experienced former spy, will be the CIA\u0026#39s first female directorAn undercover officer for most of her CIA career, Ms Haspel in 2002 served as CIA station chief in Thailand, where the agency conducted interrogations at a secret prison using methods including waterboarding. Three years later, she drafted a cable ordering the destruction of videotapes of those interrogations.Republican Senator John McCain, who has been away from Washington all year as he battles brain cancer, urged the Senate not to vote for Ms Haspel. He did not vote on Thursday.Tortured himself while a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Mr McCain said approving Ms Haspel would send the wrong message, and the country should only use methods to keep itself safe as right and just as the values we aspire to live up to and promote in the world.Ms Haspel also had strong support from the Trump administration, many current and former intelligence officials and a wide range of lawmakers, including Democrats.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, which oversaw the nomination, supported Ms Haspel.I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the president, who will speak truth to power if this president orders her to do something illegal or immoral, like a return to torture, he said in a Senate speech before the vote.Rights groups quickly condemned the vote.

Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleGina Haspel confirmed as first ever female CIA directorPolio could be wiped out within a yearWhat to expect from the Royal weddingMillion Pound Menu review – a daft hodge-podge of recent reality show formats Humans, series 3, review – riveting sci-fi that isn’t really about the robotsCancer patients waiting up to 18 months for NHS treatment Multiple deaths after school bus collides with dump truck in New JerseyInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingDuke and Duchess of Sussex?

Here are all the latest updates about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Meghan Markle has confirmed her father Thomas Markle will not be attending her wedding to Prince Harry, saying she hopes he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. In a statement issued through Kensington Palace, Meghan Markle said: Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.Thomas Markle Snr had been intending to travel from his Mexico home to the UK to meet his future son-in-law for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. He was also intending to walk Ms Markle down the aisle on Saturday, meeting her at the chapel\u0027s west door after her drive to the ceremony with her mother.But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, the 73-year-old said on Monday he would avoid the ceremony for fear of embarrassing his daughter.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.However, on Tuesday he raised hopes of attending after all by saying his daughter had been in touch to reassure him, and was prepared to fly to Britain if his medical condition allowed.Mr Markle is reported to have said: “I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But within hours he appeared to change his plans for a third time, claiming he required heart surgery after falling unwell again.The gossip site also claimed Ms Grant had suffered a broken ankle and fractured knee in what her boyfriend described as a paparazzi confrontation on a road in Florida.  Meanwhile, other members of Ms Markle\u0027s family have arrived in London - depsite reportedly not receiving an invite to the wedding.Tracy Dooley – who was married to Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr – was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25, and Thomas, 26 on Monday.Ms Dooley, who has admitted she has not seen Ms Markle for 20 years, has previously told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday.Yet she is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she will be in the front row cheering them on in Windsor.Thomas Markle Jr, who not long ago issued an open letter urging Prince Harry to call off the wedding, appeared in Windsor, declaring his estranged half sister the “perfect modern princess”.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsKensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.On Wednesday, it was announced the bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren. The pageboys are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney.Royal siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Prince Harry has paid tribute to former mentor and close friend Mark Dyer by requesting his son Jasper as a pageboy, while Ms Markle has publicly recognised one of her best friends, stylist Jessica Mulroney, by choosing her twin sons to take part in the wedding.Read more about the pageboys and bridesmaids here.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.Prince Harry will wear the ceremonial uniform of the Royal Marines,the regiment believes.The Prince will wear the uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over as Captain General from his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh.Men from the regiment will line the route from St George’s Chapel, at Windsor Castle, to provide a ceremonial guard of honour.Palace officials will not confirm what the Prince is to wear for his wedding to Ms Markle, but soldiers of the Royal Marines who have volunteered to take part understand he will be wearing the same ceremonial regalia, or ‘Blues’, as them on the day.Other options include the uniform of the Household Cavalry, where Prince Harry served with the Blues and Royals, or morning dress.Read more on Prince Harry\u0027s outfit hereThe couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.On Wednesday Ms Craddock revealed the the flower arrangements will have royal roots.The London florist said that silver birch and English oak from nearby Windsor Great Park will be a part of the greenery adorning the scenery.Windsor Great Park is owned by the royal family and Prince Philip, holds the title of park ranger.William the Conqueror hunted there in the 11th century when the park was a forest. Roses, foxgloves and Ms Markle\u0027s reported favourite flowers peonies will also will be in the arrangements.There are moments where I\u0027ve focused on it being another commission, so it\u0027s like working with any one of our couples, and of course you take a step back and you just realise the enormity of it, Ms Craddock said.It\u0027s a huge occasion and we\u0027re just hugely privileged.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePolio could be wiped out within a yearWhat to expect from the Royal weddingMillion Pound Menu review – a daft hodge-podge of recent reality show formats Humans, series 3, review – riveting sci-fi that isn’t really about the robotsCancer patients waiting up to 18 months for NHS treatment Multiple deaths after school bus collides with dump truck in New JerseyInside St George\u0026#39s Chapel: The Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingDuke and Duchess of Sussex?

May is on a tour with a promise to keep the country strong and united one year before Brexit.“This package of measures delivers on our manifesto promise to support shale and it will ensure exploration happens in the most environmentally responsible way while making it easier for companies and local communities to work together.”The motivation behind the support for fracking – or hydraulic fracturing – is to reduce the UK’s reliance on imported gas from continental Europe.In their statement, the ministers emphasised the strict regulations surrounding any new developments and their desire for an “environmentally robust onshore shale gas sector”.However, campaigners responded with anger to the announcement, citing the damage caused by fracking operations to the environment and the lack of support from local communities.Daniel Carey-Dawes, senior infrastructure campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: “This announcement signals an outright assault on local communities’ ability to exercise their democratic rights in influencing fracking applications. “It reads like a wish list from the fracking companies themselves. The government may want to provide ‘sweeteners’ for communities affected, but nothing will change the fact that this will be a bitter pill to swallow.”Fracking is one of the least sustainable ways to produce electricityFracking in UK could be limited by lack of specialist waste facilitiesEnvironmental groups point to the water contamination and even potential seismic activity that can result from fracking, as well as the need to move away from fossil fuels altogether.“After seven years of fracking doing less than nothing to help our economy, the government’s still going all out for shale, and still trampling over democracy to prop up this collapsing industry,” said Rebecca Newsome, head of politics for Greenpeace UK. “Communities and their local councils across the UK have said no in every way they can, but the government have turned a deaf ear to everyone who doesn’t own a fossil fuel company.” If the proposed consultation that shale gas exploration development is treated as “permitted development” is accepted, companies would be able to drill without a planning application, environmental impact assessment or the approval of local governments.“The government’s plans pervert the planning process and could make England’s landscape a wild west for whatever cowboy wants to start drilling and digging up our countryside,” said Rose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Permitted development was meant to help people build a fence or a conservatory, not drill for gas.” A leaked report that emerged in February suggested the government and industry leaders had exaggerated the economic potential of future fracking operations in the UK.Fracking has previously been banned in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland due to the associated risks.Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, responded to the news by stating “fracking should be banned, not promoted”.“But the government is encouraging this dirty fossil fuel by making the planning application easier and creating a special fracking regulator.”Ms Dickinson added: “If there was a referendum on fracking, it would be banished to the dustbin of history – and that’s where these proposals belong.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.\u0026#13In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.\u0026#13Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.\u0026#13The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Spot the signs of forced prostitution:\u0026#13Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:\u0026#13Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection. We can see how dire his situation is. He has no protective gear on, and we can see the extreme tiredness that leads him to a place of anxiety and distraction, where he doesn’t care about whether he’s operating machinery safely, or putting himself at risk.”The exhibition comprises a series of large, freestanding cubes displaying images capturing snapshots of life within different types of modern slavery - in agriculture, construction, maritime, cannabis farming and food processing, child trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.\u0026#13Caroline Robinson, director of Flex, said: “When potential slavery victims are arrested during immigration raids then it plays into the hands of trafficking gangs, who use fear of the authorities as a way to control people. It also prevents people coming forward to report their exploitation.Without strong independent oversight of the modern slavery response, and a clear separation with immigration control policies, then many of the Prime Minister’s strong commitments to tackle modern slavery will be undermined and we will see more of society’s most vulnerable arrested instead of receiving the help they desperately need.”Efforts to combat modern slavery have spread into fields including nursing, business and public awareness campaigns to help people spot the signs of sexual and labour exploitation.More than 600 live police operations are currently underway and in 2017, over 5,000 potential victims of modern slavery were offered help under the UK’s National Referral Mechanism. Gang members who used teenager \u0027as a commodity\u0027 to deal drugs jailedA National Crime Agency report released in March revealed that British citizens had become the largest national group for the first time following a shift in the way police treat teenagers exploited to run drugs for “county lines” gangs.Other common countries of origin include Albania, Vietnam, China, Nigeria, Romania, Sudan, Eritrea, India, Poland and Pakistan, but 116 different nationalities are known to be affected.The majority of modern slaves identified are subject to forced labour, sexual exploitation or domestic servitude.Victims have been found in a range of legal and illegal trades in the UK, including nail bars, cannabis farming, prostitution, flower-picking and at hand car washes.Victoria Atkins, the minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, described the UK’s response as “world-leading”.“Kevin Hyland has played a pivotal role,” she added. “He leaves a strong legacy, and the Home Office is working with the Commissioner in his final months to see how this important role can be further strengthened. “Together we will do all we can to protect victims and bring perpetrators of modern slavery to justice.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting during the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria.People hold flags with the state coat of arms of Russia as they drive along a bridge, which was constructed to connect the Russian mainland with the Crimean Peninsula across the Kerch Strait.Palestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting during the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria.People hold flags with the state coat of arms of Russia as they drive along a bridge, which was constructed to connect the Russian mainland with the Crimean Peninsula across the Kerch Strait.Palestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

Iran, for its part, has close links with the Hashd al-Shaabi and the group led by the former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki and will be wary of Mr Sadr’s Iraqi nationalism. Mr Abadi stays in power until the formation of a new government, which he may lead in an alliance with the Sadrists.Mr Sadr is perceptive about political developments in Iraq. When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

It would certainly help us continue to trade between Britain and Ireland much as we do now.He said he was \u0026ldquonot discouraged when Mrs May \u0026ldquoverbally and conceptually outlined her thinking.But the Prime Minister denied claims that she will stay in a customs union with the EU beyond the transition period.After a three-way meeting with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker she said she would shortly present her own proposal on the backstop solution to the Irish border issue.A Number 10 spokeswoman said: The leaders discussed the positive progress that had been made in the talks so far including agreements on citizens\u0027 rights and other matters.The Prime Minister reiterated the UK\u0027s commitment to the joint report agreed in December.She said the proposal put forward by the European Commission in relation to the Ireland and Northern Ireland border was unacceptable.

The United Kingdom will be leaving the customs union, we are leaving the European Union.Of course we will be negotiating future customs arrangements with the European Union and I have set three objectives, the Government has three objectives in those.We need to be able to have our own independent trade policy, we want as frictionless a border between the UK and the EU so that trade can continue and we want to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Jacob Rees Mogg warned that the solution of staying in a customs union would be unacceptableLeading Brexiteer Tory MP Jacob Rees Mogg warned that the solution of staying even longer in a customs union would be unacceptable.He said: \u0026ldquoThe risk of the Government using all its mental energy on the fallback position is that it creates a position that is more attractive than a permanent deal.\u0026ldquoWe have gone from a clear end point to extension, to a proposed further extension with no end point.

Here’s all you need to know...Each year in the UK Father’s Day takes place on the third Sunday of June - which falls on June 17 in 2018.According to one tale, Fathers Day first began because of a woman named Grace Golden Clayton from Fairmount, West Virginia.An orphan, Grace lobbied her local Methodist ministers for a church service to honour fathers in 1908.The story goes that she was inspired to do this after a mining disaster killed 362 local men.Their deaths orphaned more than 1,000 children and Grace wanted to pay tribute to the children’s dead fathers - as well as her own. Another story involves the daughter of a civil war veteran, Sonora Smart Dodd, from Arkansas.While listening to a sermon for Mother’s Day, Sonora became convinced of the need to celebrate dads too.She then campaigned to her religious leaders for a special service dedicated to fathers.In 1966, President Johnson designated that the third Sunday in June should be Fathers Day.Six years later, Father’s Day was made a permanent national holiday in the US when, in 1972, President Richard Nixon signed it into law.While countries including the UK, Ireland, US, France, Cyprus, South Africa, Netherlands, Greece, Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia celebrate Father’s Day every June, others have the day on a completely different date.Instead, Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand celebrate their dads in September.Many people believe that the celebration date is different in the southern hemisphere because June is their autumn, rather than their spring, and the day can be marketed better in the spring season.And in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Croatia it’s in March.For Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Iceland, Father’s Day celebrations are held on the second Sunday of November - and in Bulgaria it’s on the same day as Boxing Day, December 26.The dates usually correspond to each country’s culture and traditions.While there may be many different dates dedicated to dads across the globe, one thing is for certain, they all celebrate the same thing –fantastic fathers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

instead being cared for by a nanny nearby on the day.It was confirmed on May 16 that Prince George will be page boy and Princess Charlotte will be a bridesmaid at the Royal Wedding.On Harrys invite list were ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, it is likely some Army comrades who he served alongside in Afghanistan also made the cut.Meghans older half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr and Samantha Markle, have not be invited on the big day.Her nephew, Thomas Jrs son Tyler Dooley, and his mum Tracey Dooley, are also rumoured to have been left off the guest list. Meghans mum, Doria Ragland, will be attending, and her father, Thomas Markle Sr, had plananed to walk his daughter down the aisle.However, on May 14, US media reported that he had been struck down by a heart problem and pulled out of the ceremony after realising he might be too ill to make the trip.It has since been reported that Thomas Sr underwent heart surgery on May 16, and while the operation was successful, he will not be attending his daughters nuptials.On May 17, Meghan released an official statement via Kensington Palace confirming her father will not be attending the ceremony on Saturday to focus on his health.All three of Princess Dianas siblings will be in attendance - Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer.Lady Jane Fellowes will be giving the reading.A fleet of glamorous pals including tennis ace Serena Williams, Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, stylist Jessica Mulroney and Made In Chelsea’s Millie Mackintosh were believed to have been in the running for bridesmaid duty, but it has since been revealed that Meghans bridesmaids are all children and she will not have a maid of honour.Protocol normally means that royal brides do not have adult bridesmaids, although Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton was an obvious exception to this rule.At the very least, we expect to see a few of Meghan’s mates as guests at the wedding – as well as fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who’s thought to be the woman who set her and Harry up.Its inevitable that the wedding will be attended by a host of foreign royals.One man who seemed determined to get an invite is Anthony Joshua, one of Harrys guests during his special Radio 4 appearance – and he wants a starring role.It has also been reported that two of Prince Harrys former flames, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy have both scored invites.Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and his wife, Princess Mabereng, who have worked alongside the Prince and his charity Sentebale since 2006, will also attend.In addition to Donald Trump, a whole host of political big names including President Obama, his wife Michelle, and Theresa May have reportedly not made the cut.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: It has been decided that an official list of political leaders - both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms Markles wedding.Her Majestys Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.The Sun has revealed that Elton John will be attending the Royal Wedding.The Rocket Man has cancelled two Las Vegas gigs on the same May weekend as the royal nuptials, which leaves him free to attend or even perform.The singer was a close friend of Harry’s mum Princess Diana and was among a handful of celebrities to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.It was the same venue where he famously sang Candle in the Wind at Diana’s funeral in 1997.Mel B was speaking on US talk show The Real when she confirmed that all five of the Spice Girls were invited to the wedding.Unfortunately, Scary Spice did not budge when she was asked about the invitation or other details around the wedding.Mel sternly said: “Im not saying any more,” but when she was asked whether they would perform or not, she grinned and looked down at her hands.Victoria Beckham, aka Posh Spice, also confirmed she had received a coveted invitation.It was reported that the couple were keen to invite Barack Obama to the wedding rather than Trump - which had all the makings of a sticky political situation.The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with Obama and his wife Michelle since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.But government mandarins had pleaded with the couple to change their minds as Britains relations with Trumps White House sank to their lowest ebb since his election last year.And as the big day approaches, the ushers, bridesmaids and page boys have been revealed.Ushers:Bridesmaids:Page boys:The Sun Online exclusively revealed that Lady Amelia Windsor has been snubbed by the royal couple and she is not invited to the wedding.The Edinburgh student and her older sister Marina, 25, have failed to bag an invitation to the wedding of the year.A friend said: “They were a little surprised not to be invited as they were looking forward to going.“Amelia is creating quite a name for herself with her modelling and Instagram posts.“Perhaps Harry just wanted to keep the family invited to a small number or maybe he didn’t want anyone upstaging the bride.”Lady Amelia and Lady Marina are William and Harrys third cousins - granddaughters of the Duke of Kent who is the Queens cousin.Numerous members of the public are selected to watch outside the chapel when the couple get married. These include:The Suns Bizarre column exclusively revealed that the Foo Fighters have dropped hints they want to perform at the wedding.Frontman Dave Grohl said: “I’ve saved the date.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took only days for peers to resurrect it.Another inquiry would be an obscene waste of time and money and serves no purpose. The public do not want it. Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account. Our country is all the better for it.No one who values liberty would have it any other way.BRITISH politics has lost one of its good guys.The outpouring of tributes for Tessa Jowell highlights how widely she was admired as a politician and, more importantly, as a person.

Leaving ANY part of the EU is “Hard Brexit” now. It is laughable.Who do they imagine would tell 17.4million people their votes were to be ignored?Not Miliband, hiding in Manhattan.These Remain ultras are blind to the obvious: that the story has moved on.And that — while the nation is divided and Brexit negotiations are struggling — THEY are largely to blame, for laying siege to the referendum result itself.Their every word stokes division, helps Brussels and harms Britain.MPs must kill the second Leveson Inquiry.There is simply no case in this new, transformed media landscape — far more tightly regulated, yet dominated by UNREGULATED tech giants — for yet another public examination into alleged wrongdoing long ago. That view unites The Sun and the .It was dismal  seeing one ill-informed peer after another misjudge an issue they clearly had no desire to grasp, then outrageously voting to defy the elected chamber’s decision of just days ago.For Labour, Leveson 2 would settle a score against critical newspapers like The Sun. For a few Tory MPs too it is a personal grudge.But their duty is to their constituents.A rerun of the 2011 inquiry is a pointless, vastly expensive irrelevance now.All Tories should stand behind their manifesto. And we urge the DUP not to saddle the Government with a new ­burden to which it is staunchly opposed.There are many better ways of spending public money and voters know it.THE head of MI5 is admirably blunt about Russia’s criminality and lies. It is to the Left’s shame that they act as its stooges.Andrew Parker is immersed in the facts about the Salisbury poisoning and other outrages. The Kremlin, he says, is guilty of “criminal thuggery” and covers its tracks with “bare-faced” lies.This should be indisputable. But Labour is now run by the gangster state’s apologists.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What Labour do every time they’re in government - they’d have sold Britain out.”The PM insisted voters “simply cannot trust” anything Labour say.And she also sent out a message to all MPs who are trying to backslide on the referendum result - saying: I consider it to be a matter of integrity of politicians that having given the choice to the British people, we should then deliver for them on that choice.Mrs May is currently trying to thrash out an agreement on what customs arrangement to push for once we have quit the EU.But Labour is also divided - with backbenchers pushing Mr Corbyn to support plans to keep Britain tied to the European single market.During todays PMQs, Mrs May also announced that the Government will pick up the full £400million bill for removing dangerous cladding from tower blocks in the wake of the Grenfell disaster."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404427254.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stephen lawrence friend duwayne brooks tories mayor of london sadiq khan","story":"Speaking exclusively to The Sun, gang crime campaigner Duwayne Brooks branded Labours Sadiq Khan “the worst Mayor ever” as he revealed he has joined Theresa May’s party.He said: “I’ve made the decision to join the party in Government - because I want to be able give young black men a voice, across not just London but across the country.”Mr Brooks, who was with the slain teen when he was stabbed by racist thugs in 1993, last night slammed Labour for letting black community down with “poor houses, poor education and high crime”.And he urged Mr Khan to get a grip on rising violence in the capital or quit.Mr Brooks was waiting at the bus stop in Eltham with 18-year-old Stephen when the pair were brutally set upon in an unprovoked attack in 1993.He previously served as a Liberal Democrat councillor in Lewisham, South-East London and stood as an independent candidate in last month’s local elections.He was awarded an OBE in 2015 for his campaigning work.Now senior Tories believe he could be their man to run for City Hall in 2020.One London Conservatives source said: He would be a brilliant candidate to take on Londons failing Mayor.Yesterday Mr Brooks blasted incumbent Sadiq Khan over the politan Police’s controversial “Gang Violence Matrix” that a recent report found to be racially discriminatory.The police database holds information on thousands of people deemed a threat to community safety, but the Met have admitted 1,500 names on the list posed no threat to the public.Taking aim at the Labour Mayor, Mr Brooks blasted: “I don’t understand nobody has called for his head to roll following the discovery of the Gang Matrix.“It is beyond me that Amber Rudd can be forced to resign on issues that were nothing to do with her, and yet here here we have Sadiq Khan who must have had knowledge that this gang matrix document existed.“And he hasn’t apologised to London, he hasn’t apologised to black Londoners.”He added: “This is why London needs a voice, why young black men need a voice. And Labour isn’t that voice for young black men. I’ve seen it, I’ve experienced it.He added: “Labour failed us, and London predominantly.“Yet we have a Mayor that seems to not recognise that his leadership is part of the problem in London.”Asked if he could run for City Hall himself, Mr Brooks said he was focusing on his community work but did not rule out a bid one day.The Conservative party declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not.

And that is why today\u0027s announcement has sparked such outrage.On the one side there are those who think that controlling the scope of betting machines amounts to proof of a nanny state.The Government is meddling, they say, and it will cost jobs and destroy fun. If people want to waste their money on betting machines with a paltry chance at making a profit, so the argument goes, who are we to stop them.On the other side are those who point at the victims of gambling addiction, and who believe that the state\u0027s role is, basically, to stop people doing things that are bad for them, their families and, you might say, for society at large.Now it is hard to say that fixed-odds betting terminals do any social good. Yes, they raise money for the Treasury, and help bolster the profits of some - but not all - betting companies.It may be that some people find them fun, just as some people think fox hunting is fun, but social good? Hardly.The flip side is that it is hard to argue that they don\u0027t do harm - there are many stories of players frantically spending the family savings, of desperate addiction, and of the hapless inadequacy of the existing laws to stop repeat losers.One gambler lost \u0026#16314,000 in seven hours others have been convicted after smashing up shops in desperate fury.The industry will have us believe that these people will all drift to alternative locations - amusement arcades, casinos and shadowy back-street suppliers. The problem, they say, will just be moved elsewhere. What\u0027s more, so we are told, the collapse of these machines will also result in hundreds of shops closing, thousands of job losses, and a huge hit to the Exchequer.And yet sometimes Governments are there to make these sort of judgements.Presumably, somewhere, there are people who were laid off when the local land-mine factory closed.At the end of the First World War, workers were laid off from the factory in Avonmouth where Britain had been making mustard gas. It\u0027s not good enough, frankly, to defend something purely on the grounds that an industry supports jobs.As for the Treasury - that\u0027s a matter for the Government. But within the context of the nation\u0027s tax take, it\u0027s not a big loss, particularly when set off against the plans to impose a different levy on the betting industry.Our giant betting companies are all profitable enterprises, whose future is not dependent upon these machines.

Terry White once blew \u0026pound41,000 in just one day on the machines - FOTBs for short. The 54-year-old former betting shop manager and ex-professional gambler still owes \u0026pound100,000 to different parties  He told WalesOnline the machines were as addictive as “crack cocaine” and left him like a “zombie”.  In his opinion, the new Government rules on how much people can feed into the machines at any one time, campaigned for heavily by a Swansea MP, may save others from suffering the massive losses he has. But he hopes the changes will come in quickly. Currently, people can bet up to \u0026pound100 every 20 seconds using FOTBs.  Mr White, from Barry, south Wales, said: “These machines seem quite innocent, but after I lost my daughter in October 2015 I started to play the machines to forget about my grief. “My daughter was 24 at the time and I had done well enough to have a house and \u0026pound100,000 in the bank - my life has not been the same since that phone call. “One day I lost \u0026pound41,000 in Ladbrokes in Cardiff. “I still owe \u0026pound100,000 to various parties. He said the decision to curb the amount of cash staked was a good thing, and added: “It will make a huge difference. “I do not believe there will be all these job losses if they bring it down to \u0026pound2. “Within the betting industry there needs to be massive reform. “People can lose their lives.  “It’s like being in a zombie-like state - there could be a fire but my focus would be on the ball spinning around.” Mr White, who is working with Citizens Advice in a bid to help others, said he was punting thousands of pounds when the highest prize he could win in a spin was just \u0026pound500, compared to the machines in Las Vegas where you could gamble a dollar and a $5 million jackpot was up for grabs. “I want to stop people from racking up debts,” he said. “It will take 50 times as long for me to rack up those debts with the new regulation, but it could take 18 months to come in. “We have fought a strong campaign.” Campaigning MP Carolyn Harris said she was delighted with today’s decision to cut the maximum stake. FOBTs have caused so much social harm and huge losses for those who can least afford it, she said. Last year there were more than 230,000 individual sessions in which a user lost more than \u0026pound1,000. “This was morally the right decision to make and it is victory for all those people whose lives have for far too long been blighted by these toxic machines.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn faces dramatic new","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn faces new pressure as four senior MPs demand a second referendum on BrexitEXCLUSIVE: The Merseyside Labour MPs broke with their party’s official policy as they called for a ‘People’s Vote’ on the UK’s final deal\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter18:00, 17 MAY 2018Updated18:18, 17 MAY 2018NewsJeremy Corbyn has said he respects the result of the 2016 EU referendum (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Corbyn faced new pressure tonight as four senior MPs demanded a second referendum on Brexit. The Merseyside Labour MPs broke ranks with their party leader’s policy as they called for a ‘People’s Vote’ on the UK’s final deal. Labour has said it is not calling for a second referendum after 52% of voters backed Leave in 2016. But ex-frontbenchers Alison McGovern, Luciana Berger and Maria Eagle argued a bad Brexit deal would be “catastrophic” for Labour’s northern heartlands and the NHS. They, MP Louise Ellman and Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson signed a joint open letter calling for Theresa May’s final deal with Brussels to be put to the public. It comes a week after a similar letter by five MPs in the North East. The MPs, who have more than 50 years’ Commons experience between them, said Tory ministers do not have “a mandate to force a bad Brexit deal on the people of Merseyside”.  Even with a free trade deal GDP growth could be 8% lower in the North West, they said, which “would be catastrophic for already-stretched public services including our NHS”. The House of Commons is set to get a vote on Mrs May’s deal later this year. But the Merseyside MPs said Brexit was “much too big a deal for just 650 MPs in London to decide” without “the rest of the country having their say.” They added: “We need look no further than the wise words of the Liverpool manager J\u0026uumlrgen Klopp, who said ‘let’s sit together again. Let’s think about it again and let’s vote again with the right information – not with the information you’ve got around the Brexit campaign.’ “We agree with Jurgen, and we believe there should be a People’s Vote on the Brexit deal.”  Ms McGovern is an outspoken pro-EU MP and is co-chair of the Labour Campaign for the Single Market. It is said to be the first time the other three MPs - also heavily pro-EU - have explicitly backed a ‘People’s Vote’ on the final Brexit deal. The letter comes a week after a similar call by five Labour MPs in the North East. Catherine McKinnell, Bridget Phillipson, Phil Wilson, Paul Williams and Anna Turley all signed the previous letter.

The PM is expected to appoint 10 more Conservative peers while the news is dominated by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s nuptials. Most are set to be loyal to Mrs May on Brexit after a series of humiliating EU vote defeats in the Lords. Alexandra Runswick, director of Unlock Democracy, said: “This move is hypocritical, opportunistic, and weak. The Government is treating the public like idiots. “Fresh from a defeat in the House of Lords on their flagship [Brexit] legislation, Theresa May is cowering in the shade of the Royal Wedding as she packs the House of Lords with cronies and failed MPs.  “It was barely a fortnight ago that Conservative MPs were calling for the upper chamber to be abolished altogether. Well, they’ve certainly changed their tune.” A source close to the Cabinet Office’s Honours Committee said today: “This has been on and off, on and off for months, but they’re likely to do it this weekend. “They believe the Royal Wedding will be a good time to bury bad news.” The announcement could come as soon as Friday with former minister Sir Eric Pickles and ex-Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley among the Tories to take ermine. It is likely that about 10 new Conservative peers will be created, along with three Labour and one for the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up the Government. Other Conservative grandees tipped for ermine include ex-MPs Sir Edward Garnier, Julian Brazier and Andrew Tyrie. All either quit the Commons or lost their seats at last June’s general election.  Labour peers are expected to include seasoned campaigner Martha Osamor, mother of Shadow International Development Secretary Kate Osamor. Labour’s former general secretary Iain McNicol is also tipped for the Lords. The Mirror understands the DUP will be handed one peerage, expected to go to former MP William McCrea. Peers can trouser \u0026pound300 a day just for turning up. There are about 800, making it the second biggest parliamentary chamber in the world after China’s National People’s Congress. Increasing the size of the Lords will unleash fresh criticism of the PM. She has called on Labour and the Lib Dems to encourage more of their peers to retire to slash the size of the Lords. Mrs May said the Tories had a better record of “embracing retirement at the appropriate time”.

A total of 53 pacts with “confidentiality clauses” have been struck in the past five years preventing disgruntled workers from speaking out, a senior MP has admitted. Deterring further complaints was one of the reasons given for defending covering up agreements. Campaigning Labour frontbencher Justin Madders unearthed the figures after it emerged a former private secretary to Commons Speaker John Bercow was paid \u0026pound86,250 in 2010 as part of a deal requiring him to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Mr Madders said: “These figures reveal a concerning pattern that raises serious questions about the culture operating in Parliament. “Any employer, let alone one that should be an exemplar to the nation, ought to be asking itself serious questions about why so many employees have been asked to sign these agreements.  “If those who may have been mistreated at work are bought off and silenced in this way then it is difficult to see how those who are responsible for these actions can ever be held to account. “Parliament needs to clean up its act and that has to start with it being honest with itself about the problems it has.” Mr Bercow’s former official Angus Sinclair claimed the Speaker shouted at him, undermined him in front of other staff, swore and attempted to physically intimidate him. A mobile phone smashed on the desk in front of him on one occasion, he said. Mr Bercow has denied all allegations of bullying. A written parliamentary answer shows that since 2013, “the Commons has signed a number of settlement agreements with employees (formerly known as compromise agreements)”. It goes on: “In some cases, the House has reached agreements with individuals through ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation AND Arbitration Service), which are equivalent to settlement agreements but known as COT3 agreements.  “The majority of these have brought the employment contract to an end, although there have been a small number of in-employment settlements.” The deals were used eight times last year on 15 occasions in 2016 five times in 2015 14 times in 2014 and 11 times in 2013. Answering for the Commons Commission, Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, said: “Confidentiality clauses are included in all or almost all of these agreements. “Confidentiality clauses are intended to protect both the employer and the employee, as well as to ensure that the content of the settlement agreement itself is not discussed (so, for example, neither side will reveal how much, if any, money was paid under the agreement). “An agreement will often include an agreed reference or public statement from the employer about the employee, and the confidentiality agreement will state that the only comment made by either party will be in the specified form.” Mr Brake, a former Minister, said that gagging clauses “have no longer been included as a matter of course” since January 2015. He insisted: “Each case is considered on its merits.

The Prime Minister confirmed she will soon reveal plans for a backstop if the riddle of the Irish border isn\u0027t solved in time. It comes after months of deadlock over how to stop a \u0027hard\u0027 border, with guards and customs checks, springing up between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The new plan, signed off by Cabinet, will reportedly see the UK match EU customs tariffs after 2020 if there is no Irish deal. This has sparked fury from Tory Brexiteers, who said it would trap Britain in purgatory after the Brexit transition period. Today Mrs May insisted Britain WILL leave the EU Customs Union - which is needed to strike global trade deals - at the end of December 2020.  But she dodged the question of whether a customs arrangement could be extended in some form. Instead she said: [We will be] ensuring that at the end of the implementation period, as from the end of December 2020, we will be able to be operating that independent trade policy. Brussels\u0027 previous \u0027backstop\u0027 would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with EU rules. Furious Mrs May said this was unacceptable because it would set up a border between the province and the rest of the UK. But in a major headache, she\u0027s essentially signed up to the EU\u0027s version already in a legal text that was published by both sides in March. That text said the backstop will apply unless and until another solution is found. That means if EU leaders reject Mrs May\u0027s new plan, she could be stuck with what the EU has already proposed.  Confirming she will bring forward a new version of the backstop, the PM told journalists in Macedonia: The [EU] Commission published a fallback option which was not acceptable to us. And we will be bringing forward our own proposal for that fallback option in due course. It came after Mrs May met the leaders of Germany, France and Ireland in a whistlestop tour of southeastern Europe. She told Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker about the backstop plan. A Number 10 spokeswoman said: The leaders discussed the positive progress that had been made in the talks so far including agreements on citizens\u0027 rights and other matters.

McQueen kept irregular hours and was often abroad or staying at his cottage bolt hole on the Sussex coast. He also kept company with a fast living flamboyant society set including Kate Moss and socialite Annabelle Neilson. Yet despite the sometimes aloof reputation of the fashion world, McQueen was generous and loyal to his friends and loyal employees. But on the morning of February 11, 2010, as he tried to enter the Mayfair apartment where his boss lived in London, Cesar found the security chain attached preventing his entry.  McQueen, who first name was Lee, had been having a tough time recently. His beloved mother had died the week before and her funeral was the next day. The day after her death the 40-year-old had written on his Twitter page: RIP mumxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Four days later, he wrote that he had had an awful week but said friends have been great, adding: Now i have to some how pull myself together. It was a few days before the start of London Fashion week, and while the designer was not showing a collection he was expected to attend parties and shows. As he eventually let himself in via the utility room Garcia began to sense something was amiss. McQueen\u0027s beloved dogs - Minter, a mongrel, Juice, an English bull terrier, and Callum, a Rhodesian ridgeback - were loudly whining. Inside the multi-million pound flat the two bedrooms were in darkness.  A candle was burning on the floor in the spare room and the rooms were a mess. Garcia, who along with his wife Marlene, worked as McQueen\u0027s housekeeper and dog walker, initially started cleaning up as his boss was apparently not there. There was an empty sleeping pill packet by the main bed. He had recently been diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder and told his psychiatrist, Dr Stephen Pereira he saw his work as a double-edged sword. The previous year McQueen had attempted two drug overdoses in May and July, describing both as cries for help. But inside the flat Garcia was about to learn that with his third attempt he had been far more determined to succeed - and he eventually found McQueen hanged in his spare bedroom. Among the chaotic scene at the flat was a bloodstained dagger and more blood in the en-suite bathroom. There was a closed laptop on the bed. Later when the police opened it the screen showed McQueen had been searching the internet for information about suicide. Garcia found more blood and knives in the second bedroom\u0027s en-suite shower room.  McQueen, it would later emerge, had battled with a drug habit which at its height was costing \u0026pound600 a day in cocaine. A post mortem examination found he had a significant quantity of cocaine in his body, along with sleeping pills and a powerful anaesthetic/tranquilliser. When police investigators examined the scene they found an art catalogue on the bed from an exhibition, The Descent of Man, by the modern British artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz. McQueen had written a suicide note on the back of the book.  The full contents of the note have never been disclosed, but it ended with a goodbye: Please look after my dogs. Sorry, I love you, Lee. PS Bury me at the church. It was a tragic end to a fairytale career which started in a modest family upbringing in Lewisham in south London. He had enjoyed a meteoric rise since 1992, when his entire student design collection was bought by fashion stylist Isabella Blow. Blow, who later poisoned herself, used her connection to promote McQueen and his distinctive sexualised style. He once said: I like to think of myself as a plastic surgeon with a knife and I want to empower women. I want people to be afraid of the women I dress. People find my things sometimes aggressive. But I don\u0027t see it as aggressive. I see it as romantic, dealing with the dark side of personality, and There is no way back for me now. I am going to take you on journeys you\u0027ve never dreamed were possible.  His appeal helped make him British Designer of the Year four times and saw him named head designer at Givenchy.

Matt Fairfull, 62, who has several front teeth missing said he had no intention of paying for expensive dental work. He insisted that he did not want to change his trademark smile with one tooth poking out of his mouth, despite the cash windfall. When Matt was asked at a press conference if he would be getting his teeth fixed, his wife Marilyn, 64, stepped in to reply: He probably will. Matt immediately corrected her, saying: No I won\u0027t because it would not be me. I am what I am. I am happy with the way they are. I am the governor, no matter what. Factory worker Marilyn joked: He won\u0027t do anything I say. He does what he wants. But she admitted that she would probably pay for a dentist to improve her own discoloured teeth.  The couple who have four sons and five grandchildren said they wanted to spend their win on decorating their home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. They are also splashing out on a trip Jamaica which will be their first holiday in ten years, new furniture and a giant TV to replace their existing 50-inch model so Matt can watch the World Cup in comfort. But self-employed Matt who works up to seven days a week said he was not giving up work because he had to keep busy and did not want to let anyone down. He also has no plans to replace his 22-year-old Vauxhall Corsa van which he bought five-years-ago for \u0026pound470. Matt said: I have always been around old vehicles for work. I am used to old vans, and that is me. At the moment we have commitments for people and we need to settle down and take it from there.  We are going to carry on and keep being normal people. It\u0027s not going to be normal, but you want to keep yourself pretty straight and narrow. Matt confessed that he had gone into work this week because he had promised a plastering job for someone moving home. He joked that he would now be limiting himself to working just six and a half days a week to give himself a half day off. Matt also insisted that he and his wife of 33 years did not want to move from their three bedroom semi detached house. He said: We are happy where we are living. But he added: Like everybody, we have had good times and bad times, but now it could get a little bit better. Tennis fan Marilyn who has never been to the Wimbledon championships said she may buy herself a ticket for the mens\u0027 final this year, as well as a new car to replace her 14-year-old Toyota Celica. She also plans to cut back her hours at her part time job packing greeting cards at a family run factory in Stowmarket.  Marilyn said she did not want to retire completely because she enjoyed working with her colleagues so much. Her jackpot winning Monopoly Classic scratchcard was one of two she bought for \u0026pound5 each from the Esso petrol station last Sunday at Combs Ford near Stowmarket. She paid for the cards with a \u0026pound10 win on another card, while on her way to pick up her son who was travelling back to Stowmarket from Ipswich by bus. As she waited for him in her car at the town\u0027s station, she scratched one card which won \u0026pound20 and then did the other one which turned out to be worth \u0026pound1 million. She said: I felt physically sick. I just didn\u0027t believe it. I kept looking at the card until my son arrived, and I said: \u0027Look at this.\u0027 He just said, \u0027Oh my God\u0027.

Shockingly the build-up had left her unable to hear, and she was unable to get a hearing aid into her ear. The grim clip shows Neel Raithatha, who runs a clinic in Leicestershire, extracting the earwax - which had left the patient with a fungal infection. Neel - who goes by the name the \u0027Wax Whisperer\u0027 - said the wax caused the patient\u0027s hearing aid to whistle and squeal. He said: It would be impossible to self-remove. The client in this case wore a hearing aid which can cause earwax build as it can prevent the natural migration of earwax out of the ear canal.  Regularly use of ear wax drops and avoiding using cotton buds can sometimes help prevent a build up of earwax. The patient had a fungal infection, otomycosis, which developed on the dead earwax and skin and also otitis externa of the ear canal and eardrum. Otomycosis usually occurs in hotter climates and is more common in people who swim regularly and have diabetes. There was some offensive odour from the ear. It took around 10 minutes because I had to be very delicate when peeling of the dead infected skin off the ear canal and eardrum. It usually takes half the time.

Callum Chase, 25, and brother Connor, 23, spotted three men unloading mattresses and chairs from a van. The tree surgeons stopped and confronted the men who denied they were doing anything wrong. The brothers were joined by their boss and two other passing workmen, who used their vans to box in the group. They spent the next two hours waiting for police and were able to persuade the suspected fly-tippers to put the waste back in their van. The local council is now investigating with a view to taking possible legal action. Callum said: “The first hour was almost a constant argument with the men, about why they couldn’t be fly-tipping and not realising at all why they were doing something wrong.  “We’d say, ‘no you are not allowed to do that’, and they’d reply, ‘But there is rubbish already here’ - there were beer bottles, bags, etc. “They kept saying they didn’t do it all, only the mattresses and the chair. One of the men, who was in the van, panicked, and started reversing, but my brother was leaning against the van to stop it. Callum and Connor trapped the men in Kensworth, Beds., last week alongside a plumber who was driving behind them. They then called in boss Duncan Tomblin, who arrived with his van and blocked the three men in. Police took the men\u0027s details and statements which were then passed to Central Bedfordshire Council.

Thomas Markle Jnr, 51, told how from an early age, the bride-to-be showed she “genuinely cares about people” and puts them first. Standing outside Buckingham Palace yesterday, he said: “Perhaps Harry sees a lot of his mum in Meg, how she is with people. “From the moment she could put her arms around someone, she always wanted to cuddle to them. She was an incredibly affectionate child who developed a tremendous sense of empathy and understanding for people. People wrongly think because she is an actress, it is fake.  I understand why they would. “You see this huge Hollywood smile with her big eyes, but, behind it all, she genuinely cares about people.” He added: “When I read she’d secretly visited the Grenfell Tower victims it came as no surprise to me. She’ll still be going, knowing her as I do.” The dad of two gave a unique insight into actress Meghan, 36, which he says the world will see after she marries Harry tomorrow. He told how the Suits star helped him nurse their gran Doris, with the aid of their dad Thomas Markle Snr, 73, after Doris was diagnosed with dementia in 2009.  Thomas Jnr said: “What people will learn is how unselfishly she puts others first. When our grandmother was ill, she was placed into a home. “Dad had grown increasingly worried after she was found putting things on the stove or wandering the streets, confused. For two years, every other weekend Meghan visited Gran without fail. She would read to her, show her books, watch TV with her. She did anything to make life appear normal as possible. “As she grew worse, Gran would often forget who my dad or I was. We were going every weekend. But when Meg walked in, an instant smile crossed Gran’s face and she knew she’d be OK.” He went on: “Meg has this ability to bring comfort to those she meets, and I truly think it’s something similar to what Princess Diana had.  She has a great warmth for people she meets, installed in her by [her mum] Doria and Dad.” Thomas Jnr yesterday toured Kensington Palace to see where his half-sister will spend her new life with Harry, 33. Recalling Meghan’s upbringing, he said their dad “doted” on her. The glazier went on: “She was his entire world. “Dad worked very long days as a lighting director in Hollywood. He was extremely well respected in his field and got paid well for what he did. It allowed him to provide everything Meg could wish for she wanted for nothing. “But despite the lifestyle she had, it was Dad’s affection she was richest in. There’s a picture of Meg as a baby lying on his chest. It’s the perfect picture of the two. They were inseparable.”  Thomas Jnr, who hopes to rebuild his relationship with Meghan after growing apart in recent years, was 15 when she was born. Several years earlier, his dad had met make-up artist Doria Ragland at a TV studio and they fell in love. Despite a 12-year age gap, the pair got married. They lived in the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles when Meghan was born. Thomas Jnr would often be called on for babysitting. He said: “She was adorable growing up. When I was about 18 and Meg was three, I had a dog called Bo. She loved him like he was hers. The pair of them would never let each other out of their sights before curling up to go to sleep.”  Thomas Snr and Doria later moved with Meghan to Hollywood, but shortly after their relationship began to falter. They split by the time Meghan was six.

The 36-year-old grinned as she and Harry were driven into Windsor Castle where final preparations for the wedding are taking place. The couple left Kensington Palace this afternoon with best man Prince William and wife Kate Middleton in a second car heading for Windsor Castle, where The Queen was in residence. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were joined by their children - four-year-old page boy Prince George and three-year-old bridesmaid Princess Charlotte.  Groom-to-be Harry wore a grey jumper while Meghan, in cream, flashed her sparkling engagement ring at cheering crowds. Later, as they departed, the couple were pictured looking at each other in the back seat, with Meghan, wearing large sunglasses, offering a warm smile to her future husband.  Kate, who has not been seen in public since the birth of Prince Louis, sported a pair of oversized sunglasses and a flowery outfit alongside her suited husband. Meghan, meanwhile, was surrounded by her mother, close friends and future in-laws as final preparations were made for the wedding.  This morning she is understood to have spent time with her best friends including stylist Jessica Mulroney and author Lindsay Roth before being driven to Windsor. Outside the castle walls excitement was building in the town as royal fans began to camp out on the procession route and tourists flocked to buy wedding souvenirs. Earlier today, Meghan confirmed her dad will not be walking her down the aisle at her wedding on Saturday.  Reports surfaced yesterday that Thomas Markle Snr had undergone major heart surgery. Today the US former actress confirmed for the first time that her father needs space to focus on his health and will not be in attendance on her big day. A source said about Meghan: “She is concerned for her father but is also excited about her wedding.  “She has her mother all her friends around her and is very much looking forward to it.” It is understood Harry and Meghan had tea with the Queen in a scheduled meeting, along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was also due to be present at the social gathering with the Queen but it is not known if she was travelling with her daughter and future son-in-law. The mother of the bride arrived from Los Angeles yesterday.  Media reported seeing two black four-by-fours and police outriders drive up The Long Walk to Windsor Castle before 2pm on Thursday. Meghan\u0027s statement about her father, released through Kensington Palace, read: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.  Doria Ragland spent the night at Kensington Palace after being reunited with her daughter following the flight from Los Angeles. She was whisked off to the royal residence after touching down at Heathrow following a ten-hour flight from the US. Shortly after touching down she met Prince Charles and Camilla for tea at Clarence House yesterday afternoon, which sources said she “very much enjoyed”. The yoga teacher and social worker will now stay at the palace in west London until the day before the wedding on Saturday.  Doria, 61, will join Meghan at the Cliveden House Hotel in Berkshire tomorrow night and will travel with her by car to the chapel. Outside the castle walls excitement was building in the town as royal fans began to camp out on the procession route and tourists flocked to buy wedding souvenirs. The wedding is likely to be the most-watched TV event of the year - so long as England don\u0027t make it to the World Cup final. Millions are expected to follow the ceremony live on BBC1, ITV, Sky One, Sky News and the BBC News channel with a combined audience that could rival the 14 million that made Blue Planet II the biggest programme of last year. The weather for the day is expected to be glorious sunshine, with temperatures of 22C as the couple process through the streets of Windsor in their Ascot Landau carriage after saying their vows.

Meghan’s announcement that her 73-year-old father will not be attending comes after days of confusion about whether he would make it. On Monday night he told TMZ that he was pulling out after the embarrassment over his staging photographs with paparazzi. On Tuesday he said he wanted to come and hated the idea of missing the chance to walk his daughter down the aisle. However, later that same day he told the website that he needed surgery following a heart attack and would not be coming to London.  It has since been revealed that worried Meghan called and texted him, telling him she loved him and was not annoyed with him about anything. TMZ\u0027s Sean Mandell told Good Morning Britain: “She has called him, she called him on Monday, after our first story broke... “But he did not have his phone on him at the time. “She then texted him saying that she loved him, she was concerned for his health, and that she bore him no ill will over the controversy surrounding the staged photos.  Thomas told the website he had three stents fitted, adding: “I’m OK. It will take a long time to heal.

Holy Month myths bustedMuslims often have to explain that Ramadan doesn\u0027t mean 30 days with no food, or that you can\u0027t swallow your own saliva\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter15:45, 17 MAY 2018Updated22:16, 17 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs we start the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Muslims have been answering a flurry of questions by people unaware of what it really means. Fasting , or \u0027sawm\u0027 as it\u0027s known in Arabic, is one of the five pillars of Islam and a very spiritual time for Muslims all around the world. But to some, there\u0027s an air of mystery surrounding the practice and confusion about what exactly the rules are. Here are some common misconceptions and explanations that quash the misplaced beliefs: 1. You\u0027re not allowed to eat for a whole month Muslims do not fast for a whole month. The requirement is to fast every day from dawn to sunset for the duration of a month.  But outside of daylight hours, food and drink can be enjoyed each day as normal. Families and friends break the fast together every day with a big meal known as \u0027iftar\u0027.  2. Brushing your teeth is not okay Brushing one\u0027s teeth is perfectly fine during Ramadan . In fact, maintaining good personal hygiene is considered to be very important within the religion. Islam places emphasis on both physical and spiritual cleanliness and purification. 3. You must fast, no matter what Fasting during Ramadan is only for those who are considered well and fit enough to do so.  If you\u0027re ill or have any health conditions which may suffer from fasting, you are not obliged to fast. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are also exempt, as are those on their periods. If you are travelling or on a long journey, you\u0027re also permitted to eat and drink as normal.  People in these groups are expected to make up the days missed at a later stage, if they are well enough to. Young children and the elderly are not expected to fast.  4. You\u0027re not allowed to swallow your own saliva This is definitely not a rule and would be impossible. Ramadan is not supposed to be unrealistic, unattainable or unreasonable. 5. It\u0027s fine to drink water Unfortunately not! Fasting means that no food or drink can be consumed during daylight hours - and this includes water.  6. Ramadan comes at a fixed time every year Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is determined by the lunar cycle. When Ramadan begins is based on the sighting of the new moon, which marks the beginning of the month. If the new moon (hilal) is \u0027born,\u0027 fasting begins the following day. Similarly when determining the last day of Ramadan , if the new moon is sighted the holy month is complete on that day. Sometimes local sightings of the moon can differ, which is why there can be discrepancies between the days different countries start and end their fast. It moves about 11 days each year in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the solar year.  7. Muslims only have to abstain from food and drink while fasting Ramadan is not just about food and drink (or the lack of it during the day).  It\u0027s about cleansing the soul, focusing on religious duties , holy, kind and charitable deeds. During daylight hours, Muslims also abstain from smoking, fighting, swearing, negative gossiping and sex. It\u0027s about having self-restraint and having the mind-space to focus on the religion. 8. You must not eat in front of someone who is fasting Eating in front of someone who is fasting is fine, and generally this will not bother Muslims, although of course this is subjective.  9. If you forget and eat or drink something, you have ruined your fast Swallowing something accidentally does not break your fast.  So if you take a sip or munch something in a forgetful moment and only realise afterwards, you may continue your fasting and it will still count.

Armed police are patrolling the streets of the royal borough town in what is expected to be the largest ever police operation in the history of Thames Valley Police.  Security is a tight-knit operation with the town, home to Windsor Castle, expected to see an influx of roughly 100,000 people lining the streets to watch the ceremony of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle .  The leafy Berkshire town is now home to the huge police operation, rumoured to cost between \u0026pound24m and \u0026pound30m, designed to ensure the ceremony is not targeted by terrorists or criminals. The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs.   For all the updates of the royal wedding visit our dedicated live blog    Wedding planning service Bridebook told The Independent it could cost as much as \u0026pound32m to ensure the event remains safe. The security operation will be even more expensive than Prince William\u0027s to Kate Middleton in 2011, which cost around \u0026pound20m, according to Freedom of Information requests.  Thames Valley Police’s extensive protection plan includes a perimeter put in force around the castle grounds - a \u0027ring of steel\u0027 - and sniffer dogs regularly patrolling the streets.   So many policemen and women are required that officers are being drafted in from neighbouring forces. Officers have started using an automatic license plate recognition system to flag any known suspicious vehicles and on Saturday there will be a no-fly zone to keep airspace clear on Saturday.  Roads have been blocked off to reduce chances of a traffic attack, a tactic which has seen increasing \u0027popularity\u0027 among terrorists in recent years - especially where there is a large build up of pedestrians. Inspector Andy Amor, who has been co-ordinating the patrols, said: Our officers have been out and about in the town, on patrol, talking to members of the public and engaging with them. These patrols are very much business as usual for us, however, they are all part of our security measures to ensure that everyone coming to Windsor for the royal wedding on Saturday has a safe and happy day.  Thames Valley Police is experienced at policing large scale events such as these and we want all residents, businesses and visitors to the town to know that we are here, and to approach us if they have any questions at all. I’m really pleased and proud to be involved in policing this event. Windsor is a fantastic town in which to live and work, and our officers are very much looking forward to Saturday and focused on making sure that the event is secure and enjoyable for everyone involved. Barriers and bins in the area have been replaced with plastic bins, which cannot be moved.

Their big day, like all weddings, is set to be filled with traditions from both sides of the family. Some are very similar to those carried out by brides and grooms across the world, but some will be much more extravagant. But there is one particularly sweet tradition Meghan is expected to continue when she marries into The Firm, and it will hopefully make her feel closer than ever to her new royal in-laws.  Every royal bride since Queen Victoria has carried a small piece of myrtle in their wedding bouquet. The flower represents love and marriage, so it\u0027s very fitting. But it\u0027s not just any old myrtle.  It\u0027s myrtle grown from a bush on the Isle of Wight given to Queen Victoria as a gift by Prince Albert\u0027s grandmother, reports The  . Kate Middleton was no exception to this rule and carried a piece down the aisle in her simple classic bouquet, designed by Shane Connolly. She combined it with her family and her future in-laws\u0027 favourite flowers - lilies, hyacinths and ivy.  Princess Diana and the Queen also had myrtle in their wedding bouquets. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday. The couple have now arrived in the town ready for their big day, and well-wishers are already camping out to get the best view on the big day. The bride-to-be has released an emotional statement explaining her dad will now not attend the wedding, even though he was originally due to walk her down the aisle.  The statement reads: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.

The 14-year-olds were inseparable and would spend hours chatting, watching TV and listening to their favourite music. So when Freya was given a pair of Ariana Grande tickets for Christmas, she knew immediately she was going to share the experience with Nell. But what started as a fun night on May 22 last year ended in tragedy. Nell was one of the 22 people killed in the Manchester Arena terror bombing, while Freya was left fighting for her life. Her family spent days in a bedside vigil before being told she would likely never walk again.  Freya has now made an amazing recovery – but the pain of losing Nell remains raw. “Nell was so funny. She was hilarious,” says Freya, now 15. “If we were just talking I would be on the floor crying. We both loved pop music. Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande were her favourite people in the world. “At Christmas, I got Ariana Grande tickets and I decided to take Nell and give them to her as a birthday present. Dad drove us and we sang all the way, screamed. We had lost our voices by the time we got there, we were so excited. “But after, I thought she was in the hospital with me. And then my dad told me she had died. It was the worst moment of my entire life.” Freya had to cope not only with her loss but her own horrific injuries. Every part of her body was affected, with multiple fractures, cuts and burns.  She was determined to recover and is not just back on her feet but joining Sunday’s Great North Run to raise cash for Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, whose staff saved her life. Freya has so far raised \u0026pound40,000 – a remarkable feat for which she was named NHS Young Fundraising Hero at the first NHS Heroes Awards, brought to you by ITV and the Mirror. The moment the Corrie fan was given her gong by Louis Tomlinson, Kym Marsh and some of her favourite stars from the soap at the ceremony will melt hearts when it is broadcast on Monday. First, Freya thanked the hospital’s medics, saying: “I owe my life to you.” And then she dedicated the award to Nell, saying: “I miss you so much but I continue to look up to you and I love you.” For mum Alison, who was in the audience, there are few words to describe her pride. “Freya is a remarkable girl and has shown the most incredible strength,” she says.  “The fact she’s still here is an absolute miracle. We owe her life to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, which is why we are doing everything we can to help them.” Freya has been a fighter since birth, arriving seven weeks early. “She spent a month in hospital and grew into a strong-willed child,” says Alison. Freya, who dreams of being an actress, loved drama and music from a young age and was five when she went to her first concert, by Hannah Montana. “Freya started to like Ariana a few years back and I took her to see her the first time two years before the attack,” says Alison. “That night was the first time we let Freya go to a concert on her own with a friend. It was Nell’s first ever concert. For Nell not to come back and for Freya to come back the way she did… it’s just unbelievable.” Dad Nick was waiting in the foyer when the bomb exploded. “Nick rang to tell me there had been a bomb,” says Alison, still shaken by the memory.  “We didn’t find Freya for an hour. The feeling of losing your child is unimaginable. So to find out she was alive we felt someone was looking down on us.” Nick told Alison and Freya’s sister, Georgia, to meet him in hospital and the pair arrived 10 minutes before the ambulance. “That’s when I got to see the state she was in and that’s why we are raising money for the hospital,” says Alison. Freya had 10 hours of major surgery and was put in an induced coma. The medical team supported the family and were on hand when Freya’s parents had to tell her about Nell. “We were dreading telling her,” says Alison. But the staff helped her come to terms with the loss. “A lot of nights I couldn’t sleep properly and one nurse, Jenny, sat next to my bed and listened to me just go on about everything,” says Freya. The family were so moved they started a JustGiving page to help the hospital. Freya faced op after op but a visit from Ariana really helped in her recovery.

Natalie Howes, 22, was viciously assaulted after asking for some cigarette paper on a night out in Weymouth. The assistant restaurant manager was left with a huge gash after being struck on the head and was told by doctors she was less than an inch from losing her sight. Natalie, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, needed five internal and external stitches after the assault and has been left with a 4cm scar above he3r right eyebrow.  Recalling the night four years ago, Natalie said: It\u0027s horrendous that I was attacked with a weapon and the woman just got a slap on the wrist. She was intent on hurting me. I\u0027ve now been left scarred for life and she got away scot-free. Natalie, then 18, was enjoying a night out with her then-partner in Weymouth in June 2014. She added: We were having a great time and decided to pop outside for a cigarette at 11pm. I realised I\u0027d ran out of paper to roll a cigarette so I approached a nearby group of girls and politely asked if I could have some paper. But one of the women told me to f off. I was taken aback by their rudeness as I could see they were so much older than me. I said there was no need for that and walked away. As I made my way down the street, I heard footsteps behind me. Suddenly, I was whacked on the side of my face. Blood gushed over my top. I tried to protect myself with my hands but the woman kept slashing at me. I could see it was the woman who had told me to f off. I realised she\u0027d taken her stiletto off to attack me.   RAF was \u0027running hot\u0027 during war on ISIS, reveals top Ministry of Defence official  Natalie was pulled to safety by her ex and his friend. She said: I was pumping with adrenaline so didn\u0027t feel the pain until I\u0027d walked away. My ex took a photo of my face to show me my injuries and I was horrified to see a huge gash on my face. He called an ambulance and, an hour later, paramedics arrived to take me to Dorchester Hospital. There I had five internal stitches and five external stitches to the deep gash on my face. The doctor said that it was only one cm away from blinding me. It was terrifying. I looked as if I\u0027d been slashed with a knife. I was determined to get justice for the unnecessary attack. The next day, Natalie reported the assault to the police. She added: They found the girl who attacked me, I\u0027m assuming from CCTV, and took her in for questioning.  But a few days later, an officer told me that no further action was being taken and she was let off with a caution. I couldn\u0027t believe it. She ran at me with a stiletto already in her hand - in my mind, that counts as a weapon. A year on from the attack in March 2015, Natalie received \u0026pound2,500 in compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. She said: Although the money helped, it doesn\u0027t change what happened. I would much rather have never been hurt and left with an awful scar than have the compensation. And Natalie has been left physically and emotionally scarred.

Adam decided to elevate the humble bar snack as it combines his two joys – fine dining and the traditional pub trade. The Cross is Michelin-starred and serves upmarket food. But it\u0027s a pub too, and you\u0027ll find locals propping up the bar as well as couples sitting down to romantic meals of Dorset crab ravioli and squab pigeon with braised endive and puy lentils.  Our sister title Coventry Live visited The Cross to find out more about the dish. Adam said: It is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but although we are a fine dining establishment, we are very much rooted in the pub ethic.

simon murray back to tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are set to launch an audacious bid to bring back striker Simon Murray to Tannadice.As manager Csaba Laszlo rebuilds almost an entire squad for next term, the striker has been identified as a man who can grab the goals to get them back to the Premiership.The 26-year-old scored 25 times in a two-year spell with the Tangerines before moving to Hibs when his contract expired last summer.Despite scoring 14 times during his first six months at Easter Road, he was loaned out to Dundee for the second half of the campaign.He hit the net three times for the Dark Blues, helping them get vital points as they survived in the top flight.Murray has now returned to the Hibees and has a year left on his contract but the feeling is he will be allowed to leave this summer if another club comes in for him.Dundee could be interested in making his switch to Dens permanent but are understood to be considering other options as well, while Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are eying a move for him. And United are definitely considering taking him back.If a deal comes off, the Dundonian will be one of more than an entire team of new faces fixed up in the coming few months.One stumbling block could be the fact Hibs, despite signing him for free a year ago, are likely to demand a fee.As United’s rebuilding process goes into overdrive, former Hamilton Accies and Partick Thistle full-back Ziggy Gordon is another name under consideration.The 25-year-old has spent the last year-and-a-bit in Poland with Jagiellonia Bialystok, but would welcome a move back to Scotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee defender julen linked with inverness move","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren could line up against the Dark Blues\u0026#8217 rivals in the Championship next season.Inverness are reportedly leading the charge to sign the centre back.The 27-year-old was nearly sent on loan to the Highlands in January, only for injury to scupper any move.Dundee announced that the Basque defender was among nine players to have left the club yesterday.Julen\u0026#8217s last season at Dens was blighted by injury with an Achilles problem then a dislocated shoulder.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county offer new deal to michael gardyne amid dundee interest","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRoss County have moved to try to head off Dundee’s advances for Michael Gardyne by offering the midfielder a new deal.After the club’s relegation to the Championship, Gardyne is out of contract and has drawn “interest from a couple of Premiership clubs”.Ferguson said: “Michael has had interest from a couple of Premiership clubs and we’ve put an offer to him that, hopefully, convinces him to stay.“We don’t need to sell the club to him – he knows what it’s all about and he would be a big player for us in the Championship.”Leaving the Staggies is former Dundee United loanee Thomas Mikkelsen along with Tim Chow, David Ngog, Aaron McCarey, Blair Malcolm and Reghan Tumilty.The Highland side secured the capture of Iain Vigurs yesterday.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us. We haven’t been clinical enough in front of goal and that’s the difference,” he added.“You look at Kilmarnock – Boyd scoring goals for them – but we feel we’re a better side than Kilmarnock. We are but we just haven’t had that cutting edge in the final third.“Obviously, I never got a goal this term which is frustrating but I think the main thing for me was I didn’t think I would play this season.“Just playing is a big thing for me but next season I do need to start adding goals to my game. It doesn’t matter where I play, goals and assists are where I’ll get judged on at the end of the day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7799532.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Streets Ahead 2018  Meet the inspirational finalists helping to make Glasgow better","story":"                          CREATIVE clean-ups, cracking community gardens and super schools are all in the running for the 2018 Streets Ahead Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7800562.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Glasgow Coffee Festival and 10 other things to enjoy this weekend","story":"                          Scottish Street Food FestivalRiverside Museum, tomorrow to Sunday"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7800652.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Major MOT test changes come into place this week -

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
