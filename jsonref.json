Yesterday he did so. Last afternoon of term. Convenient.Physically, Mr Robbins is a commanding presence: tall, bull-necked, strong hair, wide shoulders. He wore a smart suit, his black shoes dazzlingly polished. He sat alongside Dominic Raab, new Brexit Secretary (predecessor David Davis having quit at Mr Robbins’s interferences).Anyone judging Raab and Robbins simply on looks might have presumed that the latter was the politician, for he bore himself with the greater pomp.

Artillery booms and diesel fumes as...Share this articleA vein throbs on the right of his brow and he is prone to flushing in the face.When they spoke, the balance changed. Raab was husky, lawyerly enough to see off nitpickers (eg. matinee favourite Joanna Cherry of the SNP), at other moments quite impressively brusque with low-grade pointscorers (eg. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock). By contrast Mr Robbins’s voice was as soft as margarine. He was deferential. He bit on the lower lip, did lots of nodding and flashed a pair of dimples, working rising inflections into his tone. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his stand-in Sir Mark Sedwill, along with civil service chief executive John Manzoni, speak in almost an identical way.John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon) claimed that ‘most ministers knew nothing’ of the soft-Brexit plan pulled out of the Chequers hat.Mr Robbins, meekly: ‘I don’t think so.’ He claimed Mrs May’s ‘engagement with colleagues was constant’. Constant but deceptive, perhaps.Mr Whittingdale said it looked as if Mrs May had tried to ‘circumvent’ her Cabinet. Mr Robbins, who began most of his answers with ‘so’, said ‘it’s certainly not a picture I or the Prime Minister would recognise’.    Theresa May’s head of the Europe unit at number 10 Downing Street Olly Robbins was undergoing a spot of parliamentary scrutiny today. He has been given powers that arguably usurp those of HM Secretary of State for Brexit, Dominic RaabMr Robbins’s enhanced powers were confirmed in a parliamentary written answer published a few minutes before yesterday’s committee hearing.It confirmed a ‘change of government machinery’ which all but emasculates the Brexit department.Craig Mackinlay (Con, S Thanet) said: ‘I feel a coup d’etat has been going on.’ Mr Robbins: ‘So, Mr Mackinlay, I honestly don’t recognise the picture.’Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con, NE Somerset) wondered when Mr Robbins had started writing his Chequers papers. ‘These papers had their origins in other papers,’ said Mr Robbins. See how sneaky they are at this sort of thing? He finally conceded that the first versions of the Chequers papers were written ‘about a fortnight’ earlier.Mr Rees-Mogg, with deadly politeness, said he did not hold Mr Robbins responsible for a ‘worrying’ breakdown in Cabinet government. Mr Robbins thanked him. Mr Rees-Mogg now said that he blamed Mrs May. Mr Robbins gave a pale gulp, wishing he had not been so quick to thank the Mogg.It is often said Tony Blair lied to ministers and to Parliament when he took us into the Iraq War, and that his dishonesty wrecked public trust in our political system.If Mrs May has just misled her own ministers, on a national strategic relationship with the EU which may impede our economy for decades, her reputation will sink as low as that of the sharply hated Blair. And she will deserve the odium."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/24/22/4E8B3D6A00000578-0-image-m-94_1532469213531.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr appear Fox News Hannity Thursday","story":"Roseanne Barr will appear on Sean Hannity\u0027s Fox News show on Thursday for her first broadcast interview since being sacked by ABC          Barr delivered ABC\u0027s biggest hit of the year with her 90s sitcom revival, but saw it canned after she put out a racist tweet about Obama adviser Valerie JarrettHannity secured the sit-down despite Barr saying just last week that she wouldn\u0027t do any more TV interviews because they\u0027re too \u0027stressful and untrustworthy\u0027.Barr delivered ABC\u0027s biggest hit of the year when she revived her working-class 90s sitcom Roseanne for the modern political climate earlier this year.She even won praise from President Trump, who told supporters at his rallies to watch the show because \u0027it\u0027s about us\u0027.Share this articleThe network quickly renewed the Roseanne reboot for a second season, but reversed that decision just as quickly after Barr put out her tweet.On May 29, Barr was responding to a tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett when she wrote: \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a babyvj.\u0027The tweet prompted a storm of criticism and condemnation, including from the show\u0027s own cast and production team.In the end, Roseanne was cancelled before reaching the end of its initial season.

Shocking photos show distressed Husky on the pavement after two hours in suffocating 82F heat before police break in to set it free           Shocking photos show distressed Husky locked in car for two hours in suffocating 82F heat before police break in to set it freeA parking ticket on the car led those who discovered the dog to conclude it had been there for around two hours.According to witnesses, when the owners did return to the car they reportedly gave false information to the police before becoming abusive.Samantha Claire Hardwidge and a colleague stumbled upon the husky in Swindon, Wiltshire, before sharing the pictures online last Thursday.Posting the pictures online, Samatha wrote: \u0027Shout out to the owners of this car who felt it appropriate to leave their husky in their car.\u0027The parking ticket shows them arriving at 10:47am. The dog was found by me and my colleague in a poor state at 12:35pm - with the parking ticket showing they could park until 1:46pm.\u0027The police were called and removed the dog from the car. The owners arrived back at the car and proceeded to shout and swear that they didn\u0027t see what the problem is.\u0027The owners refused to take the dog to the vets to be checked despite it being visibly distressed from being in the car for so long.\u0027The owners refused to pass their details to the police and eventually gave false information. The dog was seized so it could be checked by a vet.\u0027The post has received more than 15,000 shares and nearly 5,000 comments.Kay Sell said: \u0027Disgusting, the owners should be locked in the car for several hours and then go to jail if they are still alive.\u0027Susan Barker added: \u0027Bad enough to lock any creature in a car with thisheat, let alone a husky type with their thick underfur. Morons.\u0027Ted Davis added: \u0027Stupid is not what I would say, so cruel. Bloody idiots.\u0027While Valerie Lorne said simply: \u0027Disgusting behaviour.\u0027          The husky was thought to have been in this car for two hours. After it was freed from the vehicle it lay on the pavement.

These are: Circle, District, Metropolitan and the Hammersmith \u0026amp City lines.The London Overground, while not air conditioned, is air-cooled, while the new Crossrail Elizabeth Line will have air conditioned trains.There are several reasons for why only four Tube lines have air conditioning features. The main one is because they are sub-surface lines, rather than deep-level. Being closer to the surface allows exhausted hot air to be dispersed easily and safely.          London Underground commuters are struggling in the heat during this year\u0027s heatwaveThere is also an issue with spacing. The four sub-surface lines have larger tunnels that have space for air con units to be installed on the trains. However, the deep-level lines are older and too narrow.This means that there is not only no space for air conditioning units, but also for hot air to escape properly. Another issue is the fact that there is a lot of clay surrounding the deep-level line tunnels, which traps hot air extremely well and results in the high temperatures recorded on the likes of Central and Bakerloo lines.However, in the early 2020s Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo \u0026amp City lines will have 250 new trains with air-cooling. National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 25th JulyBachelorette Men Tell All spoilers: This is why Lincoln Adim won\u0027t be thereAlex Rodriguez net worth: A-Rod\u0027s wealth revealed ahead of 43rd birthdayKendrick Lamar to guest star on 50 Cent\u0026#8217s PowerLunar Eclipse 2018: How will the blood moon affect your zodiac sign?House Rules Grand Final 2018: Everything you need to knowRobbie Williams thinks Oasis should get back togetherFortnite birthday cake locations revealed as Epic Games celebrate one-year milestoneNew on Netflix in August 2018: The TV shows and movies coming soonWorld Friendship Day 2018: Everything you need to know Ivanka Trump\u0027s fashion brand closure gets roasted on Twitter Who is America?

His first job in LA was at a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, which soon became a hive of sexual activity          Scotty, now 95, with his wife, Lois they\u0027ve been married since 1984, and she says she had no idea about the extent of his social and sexual activities among the Hollywood elite when they got together. ‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’Scotty, now 95, eagerly recounts memories from his heyday as a ‘trick’ and facilitator for decades in Hollywood, showing off old pictures as well as reminiscing with some of the men he recruited or socialized with. He waited until all of the most famous players had passed away, however, before sharing their stories and publishing a tell-all book in 2012, Full Service.‘I often think back of how nice things were I can’t think back of any bad scenes or any bad things at all,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘So many people have said the nicest and best time of their whole life was that gas station. That’s why I felt good – that I made so many people happy.’He says: ‘When everyone was living, I would never even think, under any circumstances … no matter what anyone offered me, I wouldn’t write a book then.‘A lot of people at the time knew who these people were and what they were so, so it’s not a secret really,’ he tells one fan at a book signing. ‘It may be a secret for some square that lives in Illinois, but people who live in Hollywood? They knew these people.’When asked about his own sexuality, he answers: ‘I’m everything.’‘Scotty was pre-gay,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘He himself doesn’t conform very particularly Scotty just breezes across all the fences that we erect to separate ourselves from others.’Director Tyrnauer had heard tales for years about the dual-function gas station before he actually met Scotty, he tells DailyMail.com. It was Tyrnauer\u0027s good friend Gore Vidal - to whom the documentary is dedicated - who eventually proved the crucial link.  \u0027One day he brought up the gas station, and he brought up the man behind it, Scotty Bowers,\u0027 he says. \u0027And I was astonished that Scotty was still around and that I had a personal connection to him. So at that moment, I decided this was my next film, almost sight unseen.\u0027Through Gore Vidal, I met Scotty I found out that he had finished the manuscript, which became his book ... And Scotty agreed to take part in the film, and we were off to the races.\u0027He adds: \u0027When I went to start filming Scotty, I discovered that there was a wife – and this astonishes a lot of people, that the leading male prostitute of his generation in Hollywood is married to a woman. And this just speaks to Scotty’s pansexuality.\u0027  Former Aston Hall resident talks to BBC about treatmentMoment man confronts driver who left two dogs in her car despite 90FMet Office urge public to avoid sun during heatwave warningTimelapse footage shows Greek forest fire fill sky with smokeCar park warden gives ticket to ambulance parked on yellow lineDemi Lovato stable after an alleged overdose in her homeFemale passenger stages protest against man being deportedKate Garraway feels uncomfortable around \u0027racist doll\u0027 on GMBSummer heatwave sees Blackpool beach invaded by jellyishTrump wants a \u0027fair and reciprocal trade deal\u0027 with EUWoman is put in the back of police van outside the Hilton, Manchester    Hunks in trunks: Scotty rang in his 90th birthday with a rather unusual cake delivered by scantily clad young men          Birthday boy: Scotty, now 95, celebrated his 90th birthday at LA\u0027s famous Chateau Marmont during the filming of the documentary           Bowers was raised in rural Illinois and served in the US Marines during World War II he says in the new documentary about his life: \u0027Many guys, when they got out of the service, they went back home again to the little town, to the farm I upgraded myself and went to Hollywood\u0027          Actor Walter Pidgeon met Scotty at the gas station and invited him home the encounter proved to be Scotty\u0027s entry into the sexual world of Hollywood starsWithin a matter of days after meeting Pidgeon, he says, word of mouth took off and his gas station became a hive of sexual activity.‘You couldn’t believe how busy I was I needed help,’ he says – so he recruited other men, even straight ones, telling them just to pretend they were having sexual liaisons with women if it helped them through it. Patrons of the station were charged $20 for each rendezvous.‘I was fixing every bit of 20 people a night, seven nights a week,’ he says in the film. He began to branch out from the gas station bathroom, letting other clients meet in a trailer that was kept on the property by one of his friends. When those were both busy, he could also arrange for discounted rooms at a nearby hotel where he knew the manager.He curried favour with George Cukor, the epicentre of the gay scene at the time who hosted debauched brunches each weekend with around a dozen of the most attractive men in Hollywood – where Scotty became indispensable.‘Scotty Bowers would always provide new talent,’ photographer Michael Childers says in the film, adding that ‘he wasn’t just this madame Cukor called for events he was also a friend.’Scotty segued into bartending, which helped with his ‘introduction’ service for the stars he had a common-law wife, Betty, and they eventually had a daughter, but Scotty was never home – speculating in the film that he might have taken Betty for a birthday dinner ‘once’ before the relationship broke down (which he fully blames on himself).Instead, he was out all days and at all hours, feeding the sexual demands of Hollywood at a time when stars were constrained by ‘morals’ clauses in their contracts. They couldn’t openly be gay or act on any non-mainstream proclivities, so Scotty arranged it all away from prying eyes.The list of A-list names in the film seems endless. Take, for instance, Randolph Scott and Cary Grant.‘I’d been with them inidually and both of them – what you call a three-way – and also I brought another buddy,’ Scotty says.‘Cole Porter would say, “Can you bring 15 guys?” … People have often said, you couldn’t have done that many things in a given week, fixing up that many people.’J. Edgar Hoover, May Davis, Laurence Olivier, Rock Hudson – he either hooked them up or participated himself, Scotty proudly claims. George Cukor’s estate factored into his dealings not just because of the director’s thriving gay social life but also because Hepburn and Spencer Tracy lived on the grounds – in separate cottages. For all appearances, the two performers were having an affair in reality, Scotty and other insiders insist, both were gay and they never actually lived together.‘She was a designer of her own legend, and she had several fervid relationships with talented other women,’ columnist Liz Smith says in the film. ‘She was very guarded about what she did.’‘George kind of told Katharine Hepburn early in the game what I did, in a way, and I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘I could see that. I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years. That’s almost 50 years that’s not unusual at all.’          Scotty, second from the far right, recruited other men for \u0027tricks\u0027 he hooked up with both genders and says, when asked about his sexual orientation: \u0027I\u0027m everything\u0027  Scotty claims to have had a three-some with Cary Grant, left, and Randolph Scott, right          Scotty says in the film that Katharine Hepburn\u0027s relationship with Spencer Tracy was for show and the actors never lived together he says that, when Hepburn was first informed about Scotty\u0027s activities, \u0027I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too ... I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years\u0027He talks about his own relationship with Tracy, who would often drink until he was quite inebriated when the two were together.‘He’d get up and almost fall and put his arm around me and we’d go into bed,’ says Scotty, adding that, in the morning, the actor would ‘pretend nothing ever happened.’‘He really didn’t want to be gay or admit to himself he might possibly be, so the best way is not to admit it, right?’ Scotty says.And another couple he helped, he says, were actual royalty, not Hollywood royalty: Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.‘When I took people to see Wally and Edward, I never told one person, even though they were close buddies,’ he says. ‘They were seen as Duke and Duchess.’He was recommended to them as a resource, he says, by photographer and designer Cecil Beaton – and the couple told him he came ‘highly recommended.’ He says Edward VII ‘liked to see guys and girls together and then sort of work his way in. If a guy wants to see a guy and a girl together, they’re usually gay or have a tendency to be gay – because if they were straight, why would they want the guy?’Wallis, he says, was ‘the one who’d do the talking … she was a real ballsy chick. But they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them.’And when it comes to his own sexual proclivities and history, Scotty brags that he was a particularly interesting study for Dr Alfred Kinsey, the sexual research pioneer.‘When Dr Kinsey met me, he’d already heard about me that’s why he interviewed me about four, five, six times,’ he says, adding: ‘We became friends, and he liked to interview me. I was one of the only people that completed the interview from one end to the other, meaning you’ve done everything.’(That list of ‘everything’ included men, women and animals.)‘I got him not only the best interviews he had I took him to gang bang parties and things like that and put him in the f*****g bedroom and everybody f******, mainly guys,’ he says. ‘He’d be over there, and I’d crawl over to see if he had a hard-on, and he’d say: “Scotty, I’m just observing.”’‘Scotty did play an academic role in the sexual revolution, because he was the connective tissue between the academic, Kinsey, and the people who were doing it,’ says Peter Bart, former studio chief and former editor of Variety. ‘Scotty was a revelation to Kinsey.’Harry Styles struggling to sell opulent West Hollywood...From a Hollywood A-Lister, an eighties movie icon and a...Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were among actors who TURNED...Share this articleMuch of the liberated and pleasurable antics that anchored Scotty’s world, however, took place against a backdrop of disapproval not just from studios but also from a legal and societal standpoint. Vice squads were out in force post World War II, and it wasn’t unusual for an effeminate inidual to get attacked on the street.One magazine, Confidential, was particularly aggressive about outing celebrities and spreading salacious stories – and it paid. Scotty says he was approached multiple times but always declined to confirm any stories, even true ones, that were floating around publication of such tales could easily end a star’s career.One of those stories, he said, happened at Frank Sinatra’s home in Palm Springs – ‘when I had a three-way with Ava Gardner and Lana Turner.’‘They were buddy-buddy, in those days,’ he says. ‘You know, they were a little stoned, and they were in the pool in the nude – and pretty soon, we’re in bed together. The word got around. ‘Confidential came to me with the story first I wouldn’t sign it.’Two others, however, ‘signed and went for the money.’  And when the advent of HIV and AIDS came about, everything changed – prompting Scotty to get out of the game. All of Hollywood was shocked and terrified, and Scotty talks in the film about how the survivors were simply winners in a game of luck.‘When AIDS came along, I thought, I’m going to pass on fixing people up, because I don’t want to be involved in that,’ he says in the film. ‘It’s a case where you just hope you don’t catch it.’It’s a topic he discussed frankly in his 2012 memoir, as well, writing: \u0027AIDS had launched itself in a vicious war against humanity. \u0027It brought an end to the sexual freedoms that had defined much of life in Tinseltown ever since the birth of the movies. I, too, underwent a major change. Tricking – whether for others or doing it myself – gradually slowed to a snail\u0027s pace. Sex used to be about having fun and a good time. The advent of AIDS didn\u0027t change that per se, but now sex could come at the cost of your very life. So, things changed. A lot.\u0027The wild and woolly days were over. The drag parties and gang bangs and swingers\u0027 evenings and orgies became a thing of the past. But life went on.\u0027Bowers’ own life, however, had seen its fair share of tragedy – which he acknowledges closer to the end of the documentary. His daughter, Donna, died at 23 after a botched abortion he points to her graduation photo and other pictures, her phone remains in one of his houses with the same number attached, and her clothes are still in her closet.He speaks of her sadly and fondly – though he admits that, as soon as he received news of her death, he continued working as the party facilitator that he was.‘Within an hour after I learned she died, I’m on the way to Malibu to a party with a carload of guys,’ he says. ‘I was 100 percent dependable, reliable … regardless of what it was.‘If I told someone I was going to be there, I’d be there. I never said anything to anyone about what had happened.’He was also, it turns out, carrying the tragic wartime death of his brother, Donald – who, though two years older, joined the Marines after Scotty. He was killed in 1945, one of nearly 7,000 American deaths at Iwo Jima.           Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories. Documentary director Matt Tyrnauer says: \u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials.\u0027          Scotty wrote a 2012 memoir, Full Service, detailing his sexual escapades and introductions he made for others he says he waited until the stars were dead to share their stories          Scotty says he secretly arranged trysts for Wallis Simpson and abdicated British king Edward VIII, claiming that \u0027they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them\u0027          Director Matt Tyrnauer had heard tales of a dual-purpose gas station for years before he actually met Scotty Gore Vidal was a mutual friend who proved the crucial link, and the documentary is dedicated to himRecalling his brother’s death – more than 70 years later – Scotty sobs in the film.‘It runs through your mind quite often,’ he says. ‘You don’t forget things. Some people forget things, but I don’t.‘The bad things that happened were my brother, my daughter, Betty … I created happy things and making people happy to kind of compensate for the unhappy things. Do you think that’s possible?’Tyrnauer calls Scotty \u0027the most natural, unaffected person I’ve ever met.\u0027In terms of human relations … you know, they call it emotional quotient, emotional IQ? EQ. I mean, he’s just off the charts. He’s not only street smart, but his kind of sensitivity, his antennae for the way to deal with people and to create happy, soothing situations – no matter what the situation – is like nothing I’ve ever seen before.\u0027Having said that, these tragedies that have marked his life have a deep and lasting effect on him. And I think there’s that kind of rawness and emotion to his character that makes a really fascinating and poignant person to spend time with in the course of a 90-minute film.\u0027 By Scotty\u0027s side for the last nearly 35 years has been Lois, a singer he met in a bar in 1981 and married three years later. She hasn’t read his book, and she was a bit blindsided by a lot of his past he’d never really given her the full story before they married and, it seems, even for years afterward.‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’She directs her attention to her husband: ‘I guess I feel some regret that he didn’t say something before, when I first knew you, about your life, prior to my meeting you.’Lois, Tyrnauer says, \u0027was not on board\u0027 with the documentary.\u0027That took a lot of convincing,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027She really was uncomfortable with the camera. It came to light almost immediately that Lois didn’t really know about Scotty’s past, at least in full detail, even though the book had been published. She made it very clear that she had not read the book and never would read the book, as you can see clearly in the film. We had to really work our way in with Lois.\u0027And over time, I think we got her on board - and I think she saw that we were taking a sensitive approach. And Im very grateful that she participated she\u0027s a huge part of the film ... from what I\u0027ve heard from the few people who\u0027ve seen the film at festivals so far, she\u0027s one of the favorites of the characters in the film.\u0027 She’s clearly worried (and seemingly a bit long-suffering) in the documentary, complaining about his hoarding and his continued attempts to do housework like roofing despite the fact that he’s over the age of 90. In one of the stranger bits of footage, Scotty takes out the ashes of his friend, actor and director Beech Dickerson, who left him three houses the ashes had been sitting for years in the trunk of a car, and Dickerson had requested they be scattered off the porch of Scotty’s hillside home.Scotty opted to dump them through a hole in the rotting wooden deck, which he then hosed down.‘They’ve asked me, why do I stay? Because I love him,’ Lois says in the film. ‘And somebody asked me, why? And I say, I don’t know … you just do – mainly because of the way he is: his sense of humor, his warmth, his caring.‘He likes to make people happy … it must be a chore to have to want everybody to be happy.’Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories.  \u0027I did encounter some people who were in a tribe that I call The Doubters, and a lot of them became less doubtful after I presented t hem with all of the corroboration I had discovered,\u0027 Tyrnauer says. \u0027I think the movie provides a great deal of corroborating … and I’ll be curious to see how people, what people think after they see the movie if they were doubtful going in.\u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials. I just wanted to also point out that no one has refuted the book, either, which came out in 2012.\u0027Most people he approached for interviews, he says, were only too happy to go on camera and talk about Scotty and his heyday.\u0027The reactions of everyone that I met through Scotty or around Scotty … I would say 98 percent were people who believed Scotty and were very believable themselves – and in many cases were corroborating,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027And also, what really surprised me was that almost everyone approached to speak on camera had no hesitation to do so. \u0027And among these chiefly were men who were present at the beginning of Scotty’s story, which goes back to the 1940s, early 1950s – so these were gentlemen in their late 80s, early 90s, who were of a different generation, where perhaps they weren’t as comfortable to talk about things such as their own sexuality and the specter of prostitution. \u0027Many of these people identified as straight, not as gay, but they were willing to speak very openly, candidly, and in many cases, movingly, about this experience and this part of their lives – which basically revealed themselves to be either bisexual or homosexual, or whatever you want to call it. But it was really very moving to me, the lack of hesitation of people to participate.\u0027           Though he claims he set up celebrities over the course of at least 50 years, Bowers never said a word about any of the meetings until he wrote his memoir, Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars in 2012Scotty Bowers knew the Golden Age of Hollywood more intimately than anyone else. He says he set up Katharine Hepburn with up to 150 women over the course of 50 years was part of a three-way with Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, who he claims were lovers. Bowers\u0027 list goes on and on and many of his stories are recounted in a new documentaryAnd one thing that can’t be denied – regardless of the truth of his stories and claims – is the fact that Scotty, over the years, has become a legendary Hollywood institution in his own right. And there are many, many supporters and friends who are overjoyed that he has finally begun to share his stories, albeit so late in life.‘People get very angry at the idea of these beloved Hollywood icons being revealed to have secrets – but actually, all it is that Scotty’s doing is revealing that these people were real,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘They were actual people, flesh and blood – like us.’ Tyrnauer didn\u0027t show Scotty the film until it was finished he teared up \u0027a few times and had the most elegant and forbearing comment about it, which was: The music\u0027s peppy and the words are peppy, too,\u0027 the director says.\u0027He\u0027s certainly  enjoying the victory lap of having a feature film about him in his 96th year in theaters.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/17/0D56977900000578-5991661-image-a-83_1532536140558.jpg","title":"World Friendship Day 2018 need know","story":"The Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which was adopted in 1999 set eight areas of action for nations, organisations and iniduals to undertake in order for a culture of peace to prevail:foster peace through educationpromote economic and social developmentpromote respect for all humansensure equality between women and menfoster democratic participationadvance understanding, tolerance and solidaritysupport communication and the free flow of informationpromote international peace and securitySince then, the holiday has seen an uptake of interest and some exchange friendship bands in parts of Asia and South America.

Never do it Never leave animals in hot cars, conservatories, outbuildings or caravans, even if it\u0027s just for a short while. Temperatures can quickly rise to 47°C (117°F) which can result in death.Use pet safe sun cream on exposed parts of your pets skin, such as the tips of their ears and nose, to avoid sunburn. If you\u0027re unsure on the right product, please ask your vet.Ensure pets always have access to shade and fresh drinking water to help keep them cool.Check every day for flystrike.Putting ice cubes into your dog or cat\u0027s water bowl or making some tasty ice cube treats is another fantastic idea.Damp towels for your pet to lie on or an ice pack wrapped in a towel could provide a welcome relief from the heat.Dogs may also appreciate a paddling pool to splash around in.

The word alone evokes a boundary, a crossing, a limit of known experience beyond which discovery and danger lurk. In the emptiness of the frontier, we find characters reduced to their most basic selves, the comforts and trappings of the modern world stripped away to leave them with startlingly elemental choices: death or survival morality or corruption love or hate. We also find them pitted, more often than not, against their environment. Whether hostile or benign, the landscape becomes a character in itself.In my case, the frontier was the Australian outback. Only Killers and Thieves is set in a dark period of colonial history, on the late 19th-century Queensland frontier, where two young brothers are drawn into a quest for retribution that will define both their relationship and their lives. In writing the book, I travelled with them through a beautiful yet brutal terrain. Perhaps that is also part of the frontier novel’s appeal: in our ultra-connected world there is nowhere that can’t be visited, either in person or online – but these stories can still transport us to distant times and places and make them urgently real.So here are 10 great frontier novels, roughly in order of when they’re set:1. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthyMcCarthy is one of the great chroniclers of the American frontier and its inhabitants. I could have just as easily chosen The Road, or the Border Trilogy, but for me Blood Meridian is his masterpiece, a tale of murder, pillage and (bare) survival in the lawless USMexican borderlands, written in McCarthy’s poetic, near-biblical signature style. Often hailed as one of the great American novels, it is a staggering work.2. The Son by Philipp MeyerMeyer’s multi-generational novel about a Texan oil family is rooted in the legend of the patriarch, Eli McCullough: from his childhood on the Texan frontier, to his capture and raising by Comanches, reluctant return to white society, and the empire he founded on the plains. A stunning, meticulously researched book that is epic in scale, ambition, and historical sweep.3. True History of the Kelly Gang by Peter CareyFrom the scant pages of notorious Australian outlaw’s Jerilderie Letter, Peter Carey crafted the voice of Ned Kelly and wrote his life story in the bushranger’s wry and poetic vernacular a voice so convincing we cannot fail to believe it is indeed all true. Which is the point, of course: Kelly is such a compelling storyteller that he could say just about anything and we would fall for it, reading on breathlessly and no doubt laughing along.4. News of the World by Paulette JilesThis elegant and deceptively simple tale of an ageing former army captain attempting to return a 10-year-old girl to her family, is a moving and insightful road novel set on the Texas frontier. Jefferson Kidd leads a content, if lonely life, reading newspaper stories aloud in far-flung towns, when the girl, Johanna, reluctantly “rescued” from a Kiowa tribe, is placed in his care. What follows is a convincing and moving story about their growing bond, and a subtle investigation of US politics at that time.5. Wake in Fright by Kenneth CookA chilling outback horror and an Australian classic, first published in 1961 and still in print. Placid teacher John Grant finishes the term at his isolated bush primary school and heads to Sydney for the holidays but, on a stopover in the mining town of Tiboonda, loses his money on a game of two-up and finds himself sucked into an inescapable nightmare by the all-too-friendly locals. Never has the offer of a drink been so dangerous.6. Into the Wild by John KrakauerNot a novel, but I’m including it anyway, because the true story of Christopher McCandless has haunted me since I first heard it. This is perhaps because he lived out a fantasy many of us have shared: after graduating college, he gave away everything, burned his credit cards and cash and set out into the Alaskan wilderness to live a simple life on the land. The tragedy that unfolds is one of youthful folly, hubris, bad luck, inspiration and courage. 7. Legend of a Suicide by David VannVann’s work returns again and again to the American frontier, in this case Alaska, where, in a series of short stories and a novella, a son bears witness to a father falling apart. It’s the central novella, Sukkwan Island, that dominates: the pair set up home in a wilderness hut for what is supposed to be a period of bonding and clean living, but becomes something much more shocking and dark. A poignant collection, all the more so for the true story behind it.8. The Shepherd’s Hut by Tim WintonWinton is known for writing about landscape and place, but also about adolescence, characters on their own personal frontiers. The figurative and the literal combine in his latest novel, out this month, as young Jaxie Clackton runs away from home and walks through the Western Australian desert and salt flats, in search of hope, survival and love. The voice is arresting and vivid, and the story superbly told.9. The Natural Way of Things by Charlotte WoodTen women are drugged and imprisoned in an outback compound, having each been involved in a sexual scandal with a powerful man. Presided over by brutal guards and forced into hard labour under an unrelenting sun, the tables are turned when the power goes out and the women are forced to fend for themselves. A blistering, furious novel about gender, power and sexuality that is also an engrossing battle to survive.10. The Book of Strange New Things by Michel FaberFrontiers aren’t just earthbound: science fiction and post-apocalyptic fiction are brimming with stories about survival in, or the discovery of, new worlds. Here, Faber’s genre-bending novel tells an affecting love story about a missionary sent to teach Christianity to the alien inhabitants of a barren colonised planet, while his wife lives through an accumulation of natural disasters on a struggling Earth. Multilayered and moving, in a brilliantly realised world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/addd3e1486fede10f771167848b8ddd8393bbc78/0_130_2711_1627/master/2711.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5debe189627d0572abd0d176b196cb45","title":"trinidadian creole tale wins 2018 commonwealth short story prize","story":"Judges praise Passage by Kevin Jared Hosein as ‘all a reader could want from a short story’A tale written in Trinidadian Creole that was inspired by the true story of a family who cremated a baby in the wilds of the island, has been plucked from more than 5,000 entries to win the Commonwealth short story prize.In Passage, Kevin Jared Hosein writes of a man who hears a story in a bar about a family living away from society, and sets out to find them. “A man is so small in the wilderness, believe me. The way how people is now, we ain’t tailored to live there. So when Stew say he stumble across a house in the middle of the mountain, my ears prick up. I take in every word as he describe it. A daub and wattle house in the middle of a clearing, walls slabbed with sticks and clay and dung and straw, topped with a thatch roof,” writes Hosein, in Trinidadian English Creole, a choice he had initially thought would put people off.“Originally I was afraid – I didn’t think people would understand the Creole,” the Trinidadian author told the . But the novelist Sarah Hall, who chaired the award jury, said Passage was “immediately and uniformly admired by the judges”.“It balances between formal language and demotic, ideas of civility and ferality, is tightly woven and suspenseful, beautifully and eerily atmospheric, and finally surprising,” said Hall. “It is, in essence, all a reader could want from the short story form a truly crafted piece of fiction that transports the reader into another world, upends expectations, and questions the nature of narratives and narrative consequence.”The annual prize is awarded to the best piece of unpublished short fiction from the Commonwealth. Stories can be submitted in Bengali, Chinese, English, Malay, Portuguese, Samoan, Swahili, and Tamil, with 5,182 stories entered from 48 countries this year.Hosein, who received his £5,000 award in Cyprus on Wednesday night, first learned about the true story behind Passage when he was 15. “People were aware there was a family living along a trail – they had older living customs that wouldn’t be acceptable today. Their baby died, and they had a custom to send its spirit off by cremating the body. That is what drew attention to them, and the two parents were put in an asylum, and the older children into a foster home,” he said.“The last thing on the news was that when the children were brought into society and saw a television, they couldn’t stop screaming. I remember it hanging in my head as a child for a long time. People just wrote it off as madness, but I thought it had more to it than that and I wanted to explore it.”A science teacher as well as a writer, Hosein was a Caribbean regional winner for the Commonwealth prize in 2015. “Winning in 2015 was pure validation – I didn’t really put my writing out there before that,” he said. “But just the fact that I made it on to the shortlist told me that my work could resonate with people outside my region.

Retired people could watch it, though that’s just a guess I’m definitely not inferring from the distinctive vintage to the comments on social media (“Will someone tell that annoying woman to stop biting her nails?”). It seemed to exist in the fine tradition of daytime news coverage, there to satisfy the Gods of Public Information that the discussion format was being observed. Arguably, office-hours audiences for day-time TV will always be pretty small, and so it should be. It is not the job of a public service broadcaster to make sure everyone is watching telly all the time, or at least I don’t think that’s what Reith had in mind.Presenter Andrew Neil was plainly on the right his defenders would claim he was equally hard on Labour and Conservative politicians alike, but as enjoyable as this often was to watch, as a definition of neutrality it is a little lame. Fellow presenter Jo Coburn had a more sober style and was a deft interviewer (both will continue to present the show’s replacement, Politics Live). The show never deviated, so far as I could see, from its core precept: anything Labour said that sounded remotely appealing was a leftwing pipe dream, while the Conservatives were natural arbiters of affordability. I remember having a particularly ridiculous argument when Jeremy Corbyn was promising a limit to primary school classes that was a fraction less ambitious than Tony Blair’s 20 years earlier: someone from Conservative Woman tendered the view that, in austerity politics, we couldn’t afford luxurious educational standards, and anyway, Keir Starmer’s kids didn’t go to ordinary state schools (which they did). This is silly, I thought. Nobody thinks that deficit reduction is a more important goal for a civilised nation than basic schooling. Nobody wants important debate reduced to a mud-slinging match in which even the mud is fake. But I always went on anyway, because the battleground was so clearly marked, and it seemed important to disrupt the lines, like a bad apple at a barn dance question the caller, go the wrong way, interrupt the boisterous inevitability.In the Corbyn era, many in the Labour party complained about the lack of balance, particularly on the Sunday Politics, the show’s weekend edition, where it was not unusual to have a panel of three journalists, one from the far right (the Express or the ), one from the “centre”, which broadly meant also supporting the government, and one from the “centre left”, who hated the leader of the Labour party more than the other two put together. Across the BBC’s current affairs coverage, there is a readiness to air developments on the right – so Nigel Farage is a powerful voice, with resonant views, which must be heard and respected. This courtesy isn’t extended to developments on the left, whose new face won’t become real or plausible until it’s actually in Downing Street. The kindest, but also most likely, explanation is that the BBC’s rightwing critics are correct: it is the natural home of liberals. Radicalism from opponents is fascinating, in an alien, Blue Planet kind of way, while radicalism from their own side is more than a threat it’s an insult. If we’re going to keep the same formats and just renew their titles, I would argue for more Conservatives at the heart of the corporation whatever that means for balance, they might at least manage to treat Jacob Rees-Mogg and this cascading Tory shambles with the scorn it deserves, rather than indulgent, mystified surrender.Frances Crook runs the Howard League for Penal Reform she is a magnificent campaigner, bringing a lot of old-fashioned notions such as decency to the debate on prisons, fighting for things you couldn’t quite believe anyone would have to fight for. It was a surprise, for instance, to find in 2014 that Chris Grayling wanted to ban people from sending books to prisoners, but in fairness, back then we didn’t know him very well.Crook’s legal challenge to Sajid Javid goes beyond the realm of the surprise into that of the surreal. Javid has, apparently unilaterally, rowed back on a core British principle: we do not allow transfer or extradition of any prisoner to any country where they might face death at the hands of the state. It was all very well, according to Javid, before Isis, but now crimes are as heinous as beheadings, the brutality spoke for itself. The irony that decapitation was a preferred death penalty method in France until 1977 is dwarfed by the sense of impending acrimony.I can just picture the referendum: there is no compromise between death penalty and no death penalty. There is no third way of “some death”, although some bright button from a centre-left thinktank will, equally inevitably, cite death’s support in the “reasonable anger” of the “left behind” areas, and come up with a plan for regional death penalties, where people’s legitimate thirst for blood can be decided on a constituency-by-constituency basis. There is no compelling argument against the death penalty, except for centuries of well-rehearsed principles of humanity, redemption, non-violence and rehabilitation, and we all know how yawn things are when you’ve rehearsed them. It’s another bitter ision, unearthed for no reason, except some Thanatotic lust for conflict and death, to keep the country in a state of perpetual chaos.Whenever I get on to a beach, my first thought is: how long, realistically, do I have to stay here? It’s nothing in particular – I don’t mind being too hot or ingesting sand, the sea is fine – it’s just the absence of meaningful activity, the enforced peace, all possibilities collapsing down to two: staring, or napping. At least when you’re a child, you can add “fighting”. My offspring argued yesterday about whose idea it was to dig a hole. Pacing and foraging for food don’t count they’re what you do as a prelude to telling everyone you want to leave. But look around everyone is pacing or foraging.

The immediate result was a crisis of authority within the church which led to tens of millions of Catholics for the first time deliberately defying the church’s teaching, and tens of thousands of clergy encouraging them to do so in language that was more or less coded. In the long term the damage was far worse and more widespread. Over succeeding decades, the encyclical was used to justify anti-contraceptive policies in the developing world which must have led to the avoidable deaths of tens of thousands from HIVAids.While Catholic women in rich countries can, and do, ignore the encyclical entirely, the church’s pressure on politicians in donor nations, and its position as a major supplier of healthcare in Africa, mean that women in the developing world have no such choice. The victims of this encyclical are not the westerners who so loudly and publicly rejected it. They are the women of the global south whom the church claims in other contexts to champion. There are nearly 100m unplanned pregnancies in the world every year, the overwhelming majority in places where women have no access to contraception. Around 56m of them end with abortions, something that in Catholic teaching is very close to murder, and that is a statistic for which Pope\u0026nbspPaul VI must bear a large share of the blame.Yet it can’t be said that the encyclical was malevolently intended. Read with charity, it is an argument to share decisions about women’s fertility between men and women, which is certainly\u0026nbspan advance on seeing them as a matter entirely for\u0026nbspmen. But the distinction between natural and artificial birth control, so philosophically important to the encyclical, is in practice the difference between contraception that works almost all the time, and\u0026nbspthe sort that needs everything to go right. This is true even when the rhythm method is marketed as a means of women’s empowerment, to\u0026nbspbe used with a thermometer and a\u0026nbspsmartphone\u0026nbspapp. But an entire generation of\u0026nbspCatholic women discovered this when they tried to practise the teaching religiously back in the\u0026nbsp1960s,\u0026nbspand their daughters and granddaughters still\u0026nbspknow it. That\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspthe kind of knowledge that cannot be unlearned.The distinction between effective and ineffective contraception did not seem to matter very much to the Catholic church at the time because it believed that the “meaning and purpose” of sex is pregnancy. Couples had no real right to decide over their own\u0026nbspfertility. That was for God to do – and the church, which claimed to know what God wanted. The pope may have believed in mutual decision-making, but in the end his actions showed that he could not practice\u0026nbspit. Women were not really to be trusted with their own fertility. The consequence of that arrogance has been immense, and avoidable, suffering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d4a616c118e76bd7197e453b5370a0338007c7/0_158_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78b636f23c694ec3e4c6c32131a5b8e5","title":"celtic rosenborg champions league match report","story":"Odsonne Édouard scored a delightful double as Celtic came from behind to beat Rosenborg 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League second-round qualifier at Parkhead.The Norwegian champions, who controversially sacked their manager Kare Ingebrigtsen last week and replaced him with the academy director, Rini Coolen, as interim boss, took the lead in the 15th minute through the defender Birger Meling. However, Brendan Rodgers’ side showed their mettle and goals from Édouard and his fellow Frenchman Olivier Ntcham either side of the break put the home side in front.Édouard, bought for a reported club-record fee of £9m from Paris St Germain in the summer after a loan spell last season, stretched that lead with another well-taken goal in the 75th minute to give the Hoops a decent advantage to take to Norway next week.There was tinkering to be done by Rodgers and Costa Rica’s World Cup right-back Cristian Gamboa came in as replacement for the suspended Jozo Simunovic while Scott Sinclair replaced Moussa Dembélé, who was ruled out of both legs with another hamstring complaint.The tie took a twist when Rosenborg capitalised on a mistake by Jack Hendry to take the lead. The centre-back advanced upfield only to see his square pass intercepted by Mike Jensen, who set Pal Andre Helland away and, when he moved it on to Nicklas Bendtner, his perfectly-weighted pass was guided low past Gordon by the incoming Meling from 14 yards.Celtic responded quickly and impressively. Their Norwegian defender Kristoffer Ajer skimmed a header from a corner past the far post before Andre Hansen made a decent save from Callum McGregor’s drive from 16 yards.In the 34th minute, amid growing Celtic anxiety, a penalty claim when the right-back Vegar Hedenstad clashed with Ntcham in the box was ignored by the Belgian referee, Bert Vertenten.However, in the 43rd minute the mood changed when Édouard controlled a Sinclair cut-back and stroked it past Hansen from eight yards. Within a minute of the restart Ntcham took a pass from McGregor and curled the ball high into the net from outside the box to put the Hoops fans back on their feet.Rosenborg were clearly rattled. A curling shot from McGregor caught out Hansen but rebounded off the post before Édouard came close with a free-kick from 20 yards.The visitors were under siege as Celtic, urgent and energised, piled forward to increase their lead. Hansen saved at his near post from Sinclair, then tipped a long-distance effort from Ntcham on to the bar.A third goal seemed inevitable and it came when Forrest sent Édouard racing through the middle. With supreme confidence he chipped Hansen to give the home side a deserved two-goal cushion, although it could have been three as Hendry’s header from a McGregor free-kick clipped the bar before going over.“It was a real demonstration of maturity and staying calm under that pressure and at the end of the game we could have had five or six goals,” Rodgers said afterwards.“The team is maturing and evolving all the time at this stage of the season but for me it was a joy to watch this evening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7bfc09735ca832d72a85b77c56030cc2cf8c9e7/0_158_4125_2475/master/4125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43aa8cc994da2432836ecdeb27f5eb7","title":"xherdan shaqiri liverpool stoke conscience clear","story":"Swiss winger shrugs off criticism from the Neville brothers and former teammate Charlie Adam and says his ‘conscience is clear’ and he wanted to move to Anfield four years agoRecrimination often accompanies relegation and perhaps that is why, of all the high‑profile signings at Liverpool this summer, it is only Xherdan Shaqiri’s that has been questioned. The Switzerland international arrives at Anfield having been labelled unprofessional and a disgrace by Gary and Phil Neville respectively for his part in Stoke City’s exit from the Premier League and with a former teammate, Charlie Adam, having accused him of not performing when necessary. Shaqiri smiles at the insults before delivering a convincing retort.Shaqiri scored eight league goals and produced seven assists last season as Stoke’s ten-year stay in the Premier League came to an end. A decent return in the circumstances. Adam, the former Liverpool midfielder, was outspoken in blaming the club’s “so-called big players” who “never turned up for us and never performed” for relegation and confirmed the 26-year-old belonged to that category.Jürgen Klopp evidently took a different view of a player he first admired at Basel, where one Mohamed Salah was bought to replace Shaqiri before his move to Bayern Munich in 2012. Capitalising on a release clause in the winger’s Stoke contract, Liverpool acquired an established Premier League and international talent for £13m after the World Cup. For Shaqiri, who interrupted a holiday to complete the transfer at Melwood, the move fulfils a desire he has harboured since 2014.Shaqiri prospered out left and right for Stoke and his versatility was a factor in Klopp’s decision to increase his options with the powerful winger. In Salah and Sadio Mané he faces fierce competition to become a regular starter for Liverpool but, despite growing frustrated when placed in a similar position at Bayern and Internazionale, the new arrival is undeterred.“Football is like this,” he explains. “You have competition all over the world, not only in football, in normal life too. Everyone fights for his place but, in the end, we have many games to play and everybody is going to play games. We want to be successful as a team and that is the most important thing to win titles here. Not just one player can win titles. I’m here to be successful with my team.“Every player wants to play on the biggest stages in football. I have played for big teams. I know what it takes. I won many titles with Bayern Munich so I know how it is to be on the big stage. I am really happy to have this opportunity. You can see with the transfers that we want to go forward. We want to achieve something and win titles. First of all we want to play good football and that is the most important thing. Liverpool were very close to winning titles last season. I hope this season we can go through and improve the small things that we need. I hope that we can get it this year.”Shaqiri signed following what can be confidently called an eventful World Cup campaign for Switzerland. After scoring a late winner against Serbia the winger, a Kosovan-Albanian, celebrated by making the eagle symbol of Albania with his hands, earning a £7,600 fine by Fifa for a political gesture. “It was a very emotional game for everybody, that’s all I can say,” he carefully reflects.Signing for Klopp has clearly enthused Shaqiri who, after last season’s travails with Stoke, was determined to make a fresh start at the top level of the Premier League. “I have admired Jürgen Klopp for a long time because his teams play fantastic football and he is a fantastic person. It is important for me to work with him and with people who communicate well with good character. I have only just started with my first training session today but I didn’t have a long holiday so I didn’t lose too much. Maybe I can train for the next few days and hopefully play against Man United on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fda6cb345bdf6feb66f3220f7fd110593be21b2e/0_97_5099_3061/master/5099.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ac2a1f24bd01799b9526b2e57c1ef15","title":"manchester city v liverpool international champions cup live","story":"It’s a homecoming of sorts for Jack Harrison, an Englishman who came to the USA as a teenager and played at Wake Forest (college soccer, for those outside the USA) before joining NYCFC.

Her daughter Frida – her fifth child, and her first with 39-year-old husband Mattia Dessi was born in June. Nielsen, now 55, has also revealed she started having IVF treatment 14 years ago in the hope of becoming pregnant. “Some women think, ‘Oh my God, I’m too old’,” she told American entertainment magazine People. “Well, yeah, I can understand people saying, ‘How dare she?’ But how many men have their first kids in their 60s and 70s and they never doubt it?“Do I understand that (people) are a bit sceptical? Yes, I understand. I also totally respect the fact that not everybody likes it and agrees with it, but it is my life.”Nielsen, who married Dessi in 2006, said: “It (is) his first baby and we are very much in love. We are very happy. We have a solid relationship. We are celebrating, or we have already – 14 years together.”She said it was “such a long road” to becoming a mother again, and she wanted other women to know “everything is possible, but you have to be realistic” when trying to become pregnant later in life. The star, who has appeared in films including Red Sonja, Rocky IV and Beverly Hills Cop II, said the process can be “lonely”, “because a lot of women don’t talk to each other about it”. She added: “We should hold hands because there’s nothing wrong with wanting to have a baby whether you’re 20, you’re 30, you’re 40 or, in my case, 50.” Nielsen is already a mother to four sons from previous marriages: Raoul Meyer Jr, 23 Douglas Meyer, 25 Killian Gastineau, 28 and Julian Winding, 34.

Traditionally, they’re poached, rather than baked, though the same rules apply: add the sugar to the egg whites before whisking, as Michel Roux Jr’s book The French Kitchen suggests, and the resulting foam will be dense and firm fold it in at the end, as Koffmann recommends in his book Classic Koffmann, and it’ll be softer, but hard to work with. Best, I find, to beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks, as Anthony Bourdain’s recipe in Les Halles Cookbook dictates, then gradually beat in the sugar a little at a time, to give a firm, yet light result. Caster sugar dissolves more easily than David Tanis’ granulated variety in the New York Times, though, making the finished meringues less inclined to weep moisture as they cool. Tanis also stabilises his meringue mix with cream of tartar, which feels like wise insurance even if you’re not using coarse sugar, especially if you’re not sure of the age of your eggs (older eggs whip up better, because the protein networks are looser and more amenable to the addition of large amounts of air).They can’t compete with the poached sort for lightness, though – and, really, it’s not a hard technique to master. First, I’d strongly recommend not trying to cook too many at once: these fragile icebergs have a wide turning circle, and an annoying tendency to stick together in the pan if they come into contact with each other. A wide pan is preferable to a tall, narrow saucepan for the same reason. I try covering the pan to avoid the need to turn them in the first place, as in Tanis’s recipe, but though this technique yields excellent early results, they rapidly deflate as soon as I lift the lid a cautious flip proves more successful.Second, and even more important, these are not Ottolenghi-style, billowing beauties, but foamy little quenelles of featherlight pleasure – they will deflate as they cool, for the same reason a soufflé or yorkshire pudding will, but bear in mind this is a homely pudding designed to taste, rather than look impressive (though, frankly, to these British eyes, it still does).Many recipes poach the meringues in milk, then thriftily reuse it in the custard. My problem with this is that, while I don’t think it makes a discernible difference to the finished meringues, it does mean you have to make them before the custard, even though that takes far longer to cool down, and with a dessert this sweet, you really do want it cold, rather than just cool. Simmering milk also has a tendency to form a skin as soon as you take your eye off the pan, which then clings to the meringues – water, by contrast, does not.I feel on safer ground here: custard in its various preparations would be a strong contender for my specialist subject if Mastermind ever came calling. This is a very French version: elegantly thin (though, as Koffmann cautions, it must be viscous enough to support the meringue) and ridiculously rich, with enough sugar to put you off eating more than your fair share.Berry’s version, the least sweet of the lot and the only one to rely on the thickening power of a little cornflour, is my favourite, though I concede you don’t strictly need the cornflour unless you’re feeling nervous the same goes for Tanis’s bain marie. I do like his cardamom and lemon peel-infused milk, however, even if vanilla is de rigueur in the classic preparation – and if you’re feeling particularly decadent, you might want to cut the milk with a little single cream to make a British equivalent of his suggested “half and half”.Though you shouldn’t need to strain your creme anglaise unless you’re worried the Michelin inspectors are in town, I do highly recommend plonking the finished custard in a sink of cold or iced water to ensure it’s refreshingly cool – David Lebovitz even chills his bowls before serving. (Berry butters hers, though I can’t for the life of me work out why.)Roux makes a strawberry compote to go with his îles flottantes, and Tanis poaches cherries in a rose syrup, both of which are utterly delicious with yoghurt, but rather too sweet for our taste when paired with the meringue and custard. If you’d like some fruit in the bowl, I think some baked rhubarb would go very nicely – l’entente cordiale in dessert form.Nuts are a common garnish, and Koffmann goes one step further with pink praline almonds, which “bring a nice crunch and the colour looks pretty”, but they’re hard to get hold of in this country – and, again, very sweet. His suggested alternative of pistachios or toasted almonds, also used by Berry and Bourdain, prove more popular, adding crunch without extra sugar – unlike the caramel that’s widely used in restaurants. If you’re a sugar fiend, though, it’s very easy to add – once you’ve portioned out the puddings, heat 150g sugar in a pan until a rich brown, then drizzle over the top. Repent at leisure.4 eggs500ml whole milk1 vanilla pod, split, or a dash of vanilla extract120g caster sugar1 tsp cornflour (optional)¼ tsp cream of tartar1 pinch salt2 tbsp flaked almondsSeparate the eggs, putting the yolks into a medium heatproof bowl and the whites into a large, scrupulously clean one. Set this aside while you make the custard.Pour the milk into a medium saucepan and add the vanilla. Bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 10 minutes. Bring back to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk 40g sugar with the egg yolks and cornflour, if using, until dissolved. Put the bowl on a damp kitchen towel near the hob (this helps anchor it) and half-fill the sink with cold water.Remove the vanilla pod, if using (give it a quick rinse, dry well and use to perfume a jar of sugar). Pour half the simmering milk over the yolks, whisking all the time, until well combined, then pour back into the milk pan. Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon – when you draw your finger down the spoon, it should leave a clear line. Take off the heat. Pour the custard back into the bowl and put it in the sink to cool, stirring occasionally.To make the meringues, add the cream of tartar and a pinch of salt to the egg whites, then beat to soft peaks. Gradually add the sugar, still beating, until it’s all incorporated, then carry on beating until the mix is shiny and stiff.Bring a wide, shallow pan of water to a boil and line a baking tray with kitchen paper. Scoop a generous amount of meringue mixture on to a dessert spoon, then push off into the water with a second spoon to make a kind of egg shape. Do this until the pan is a third full, poach for two minutes, then very carefully flip over and poach for two minutes more. Gently scoop out with a slotted spoon and slide on to the tray.

The Financial Conduct Authority said a new basic savings rate would be aimed at improving returns for savers, as it admitted that past attempts to improve competition between banks had failed to improve the situation for consumers. A minimum interest rate on instant access and easy saver accounts could cost the banks around £300m, the FCA said, and may result in their having to shave a small amount off some of the best “teaser” introductory rates on accounts.The proposals follow persistent concern that savers are lured by initially high rates, but are then exploited as the rate on the accounts is cut in later years. Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: “Providers can take advantage of high levels of customer inaction to pay lower interest rates to longstanding customers. While many customers have valid reasons for not shopping around, providers must still treat them fairly, while maintaining competitive rates for those who do.“Efforts to encourage customers to switch have had limited impact and we remain concerned about the way firms are treating customers. This is why we are considering the introduction of a basic savings rate for older accounts, which would promote competition and help get customers a better rate of interest.”The hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in low-interest deposit accounts are a crucial source of profit for the major high street banks, allowing them to fund lending and making it more difficult for challenger banks to enter the market. The FCA said that around £354bn was held in easy access cash savings accounts in the UK, and more than £100bn in easy access cash Isas. The banks gave the FCA proposals a cool reception. Peter Tyler of UK Finance, which represents the main high street banks, said: “The industry has implemented a number of remedies to improve competition in the cash savings market, helping savers to shop around and find the best deal.“These include communicating more clearly with customers about the rates they receive, faster cash Isa transfers and enhanced customer prompts before a rate is reduced.”“Paying lower interest rates to longstanding customers is a long-running pricing strategy used by firms in the UK and internationally. We believe this is unlikely to change without further intervention.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffb7047e9d8e6f942d48ec0ad58f31b3f11e35f9/38_0_3923_2354/master/3923.jpg?w=740\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=014b67b638cddcb73c16e317849d483e 740w","title":"brexit uk cannot afford not to have a deal says irish government politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThis is not just about stockpiling.

Quite clearly it might be necessary to ensure that goes on a bit longer.The transition period was agreed by the government and the EU, and it is not in Corbyn’s power to extend it. But given that Theresa May does not have a majority, the stance of Labour on this issue could become significant. Tory Brexiters would strongly oppose any attempt to extend the transition, but many people in Brussels think that this will become necessary.We’ve got to have a deal, we can’t have a no-deal end to this process because the manufacturing industry and all the other services we share with Europe have got to carry on.

What is your reaction to those stories?Fox says over the last two years there have been a remarkable number of scare stories about Brexit. The UK is still attracting a great deal of investment, the economy is growing, order books are doing well. The “economic apocalypse” did not materialise.He says these scares are like the ones raised about TTIP, the US-EU trade treaty.He says the people propagating these myths are anti trade and anti capitalism.Fox says opponents of Brexit are now treating the EU referendum as just consultative, not as an instruction to government.Q: How closely do you expect the UK to align with the EU on free movement of people after Brexit?Fox says the government rejected an EEA option because it would require accepting free movement.He says voters do not mind people coming to the UK if they work and pay taxes. But at the time of the referendum they did object to migrants being able to access services if they were not working. That is why they rejected free movement.He says his personal preference would be for companies to be able to bring in the skilled workers they need from wherever.Fox says, when Juncker meets Trump, he would like to see a “de-escalation over tariffs”.Q: Has the US administration said it will notify Congress before Christmas that it wants to start negotiating a new trade deal with the UK?Fox says the UK government is starting its own consultation so that it can match that sort of timeframe.Fox says the UK cannot negotiate a free trade deal until after it has left the EU. If anyone is in any doubt, they should know the UK is leaving, he says.Fox says the fact that Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president and an unelected bureaucrat, is in Washington today negotiating trade on behalf of of the UK, is exactly why he wanted to leave the EU.Q: What do you say to those who argue that you need a hard Brexit to get the best chance of a trade deal with the US? And do you see Trump as a protectionist or a free trader?He says what the relationship with the EU will look like depends on whether we get “a people’s Brexit or a bureaucrats’ Brexit”.He says the US has always been a free trading country. It is no secret that London has a difference with the US over tariffs. But there are many issues on which they agree, he says.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has just delivered his speech in Washington. It was a fairly standard defence of free trade. But he is now taking questions.Asked about a trade deal with the US, Fox says talks with the US administration have been going on for months. He has had constructive meeting on this visit.We are moving forward with our preparations.He says he does not know what the final relationship with the EU will be. But the UK cannot wait, he says.He says he was “very encouraged” by what President Trump said about the future relationship when he visited the UK.Speaking to reporters after the British-Irish intergovernmental conference, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, said that any “prudent’ government would be preparing for a no deal Brexit. He went on:You have to put vim and vigour into it because you want to make sure that you have thought through all potential problems and you have got a contingency plan, which in that situation would work and deliver the best outcome in those circumstances.“Vim” has become a new government buzzword.

A limiting factor in making “super” batteries that charge rapidly is the speed at which these lithium ions migrate, usually through ceramic materials.One potential solution is to make everything much smaller, by making batteries with nanoparticles. But nanoparticles are expensive and tricky to make and so scientists have been searching for alternative materials to circumvent this problem.Now, researchers at the University of Cambridge have identified a group of materials called niobium tungsten oxides through which lithium ions can move at astonishingly high rates, meaning much faster charging batteries.“Niobium tungsten oxides are fundamentally different,” said Kent Griffith, first author on the study published in the journal Nature. First discovered in 1965, these materials have a rigid, open structure and have larger particle sizes than many other materials commonly used in batteries.To measure the movement of the lithium ions through these unusual materials, the researchers used a technology similar to that found in an MRI scanner. They found that the lithium ions were moving through their test materials hundreds of times faster than they would through typical ceramic electrode materials.Another advantage of these alternative materials is that they are cheap and straightforward to make. “These oxides are easy to make and don’t require additional chemicals or solvents,” said Griffith.Electric cars and grid-scale storage for solar power are two environmentally friendly technologies that could be revolutionised by better batteries.Clare Grey, professor of materials chemistry at the University of Cambridge and senior author on the paper, said the next step will be to optimise the use of this material in a full battery, which can be cycled for the time and length needed for electric vehicles. “For example, electric buses where you may want to charge the bus very fast at the bus stop,” she added.“The discovery is very exciting in terms of what it does for battery performance,” said Dan Brett, professor of electrochemical engineering at University College London, who was not involved in the work. “The really clever thing about the work is the insight into the mechanism and ability to measure how fast the lithium ions travel through the material.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a102ba810e779cf6d86b04c1bbe930cd5bd6b924/0_129_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7268d8d33be88fa32ea859ef678e55cb","title":"huge underground lake discovered on mars say astronomers","story":"Scientists have spotted a 12 mile-wide stretch of water underneath a slab of ice at the Martian south poleAstronomers have found compelling evidence that there is a huge reservoir of liquid water buried a mile under the ice near the south pole on Mars.Radar measurements taken from the European Space Agency’s Mars Express orbiter spotted the 12 mile-wide stretch of water at the base of a thick slab of polar ice in a region known as Planum Australe.It is the first time that researchers have identified a stable body of liquid water on the red planet. The finding raises the likelihood that any microbial life that arose on Mars may continue to eke out a rather bleak existence deep beneath the surface.“We discovered water on Mars,” said Roberto Orosei at the National Institute of Astrophysics in Bologna. Any other explanation for the bright reflections the scientists saw in their radar observations was “untenable”, he added. Details of the finding are reported in the journal, Science.Today, the most obvious signs that Mars was once a wet world are the ancient waterways that sculpted the planet’s surface many millions of years ago. In 2015, Nasa announced that it had spotted water seeping down slopes and gullies on the planet, but that interpretation was cast into doubt last year when US Geological Survey researchers argued that the mysterious dark streaks were no more than tumbling grains.For the latest discovery, researchers in Italy analysed three years of data gathered by an instrument called the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding, or Marsis, onboard the Mars Express probe. The measurements, collected between 2012 and 2015, show that radar waves penetrated the clear ice at the Martian south pole but reflected strongly off a body of water that lay beneath.John Bridges, a professor of planetary science at the University of Leicester, who helped locate the final resting place of the UK’s Beagle 2 lander on Mars, said the scientists had made a convincing case for liquid water on Mars. “It’s a careful analysis of the data. There’s certainly a good basis for it,” he said.Elena Pettinelli, a scientist on the team at Roma Tre University, said it was impossible to know whether the body of water was a lake or an aquifer where the water filled interconnected pores in Martian rock. If it is an open body of water, it may resemble Lake Vostok, the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica, she said.Nor can the scientists tell how deep the water is. The radar pulses from the Marsis instrument bounce back off the water but don’t reach the bottom of the reservoir. The best the scientists can say is that the water is at least a metre or two deep.What they do know is that the water is extremely cold. At the bottom of the ice at the Martian south pole, the temperature is estimated to be about -68C. Though far below zero, the water is thought to remain liquid because it is under pressure and rich in salts, in particular magnesium, calcium, and sodium compounds known as perchlorates, which are readily found on the surface of Mars.While hardly ideal for life as we know it, the briny fluid could potentially support microbes which have adapted to such salty conditions. The challenge any Martian microbes would face is resisting the osmotic potential which acts to draw water out of cells and leave them in a desiccated heap. “This is certainly not a very pleasant environment for life,” said Orosei. Though not an expert in the harsh extremes that life can endure, Bridges suspects the salty conditions in the Martian water might be too much to survive. “I think it’s really, really stretching the envelope of potential life to bursting point,” he said.Mark Sephton, who researches life in extreme environments at Imperial College, London, said that the water being so far under the surface of Mars was not in itself a problem for life. The surface of Mars is bombarded by intense radiation that effectively sterilises the surface, so if life lurks anywhere on the planet, it is likely to be underground. “As long as there is an energy source to exploit and a source of nutrients or raw materials then life is possible,” he said.“High salt conditions are good for maintaining a liquid state but are a challenge for life. If the salt concentrations outside of the cell are higher than the inside then it draws water out from inside the cell and the cell shrinks and desiccates. Life can adapt by synthesising organic molecules to stop the process but there are limits, beyond which the high salinities in the cell interfere with biochemistry and the cell dies,” Sephton added. “So for Mars, some mechanisms which keep water in a liquid state can operate at levels that are too much of a good thing for life.”It may be some time before scientists can investigate the water under the Martian south pole to see if any life lurks there. “Getting there and acquiring the final evidence that this is indeed a lake will not be an easy task,” said Orosei. “It will require flying a robot there which is capable of drilling through 1.5km of ice and this will certainly require some technological developments that at the moment are not available.”For now, the researchers will search other sites on Mars for signs of more subterranean lakes or aquifers. Writing in the journal, the authors say: “There is no reason to conclude that the presence of subsurface water on Mars is limited to a single location.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07df76fc17b76872254368b8198f51ff58033815/0_106_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e59e23b49b1797e2757ee5d4d6e7c91b","title":"usa england womens hockey world cup pool b match report","story":"Alex Danson scored in her 200th international as England and the USA drew 1-1 in their World Cup pool B match.Both sides struggled to find form in the first round of matches and neither team could afford to drop points.

The result is dangerous In June of last year, five researchers at Facebook’s Artificial Intelligence Research unit published an article showing how bots can simulate negotiation-like conversations.While for the most part the bots were able to maintain coherent dialogue, the researchers found that the software agents would occasionally generate strange sentences like: “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.”On seeing these results, the team realized that they had failed to include a constraint that limited the bots to generating sentences within the parameters of spoken English, meaning that they developed a type of machine-English patois to communicate between themselves. These findings were considered to be fairly interesting by other experts in the field, but not totally surprising or groundbreaking.A month after this initial research was released, Fast Company published an article entitled AI Is Inventing Language Humans Can’t Understand. Should We Stop It?. The story focused almost entirely on how the bots occasionally erged from standard English – which was not the main finding of the paper – and reported that after the researchers “realized their bots were chattering in a new language” they decided to pull the plug on the whole experiment, as if the bots were in some way out of control.Fast Company’s story went viral and spread across the internet, prompting a slew of content-hungry publications to further promote this new Frankenstein-esque narrative: “Facebook engineers panic, pull plug on AI after bots develop their own language,” one website reported. Not to be outdone, the Sun proposed that the incident “closely resembled the plot of The Terminator in which a robot becomes self-aware and starts waging a war on humans”.Zachary Lipton, an assistant professor at the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, watched with frustration as this story transformed from “interesting-ish research” to “sensationalized crap”.According to Lipton, in recent years broader interest in topics like “machine learning” and “deep learning” has led to a deluge of this type of opportunistic journalism, which misrepresents research for the purpose of generating retweets and clicks – he calls it the “AI misinformation epidemic”. A growing number of researchers working in the field share Lipton’s frustration, and worry that the inaccurate and speculative stories about AI, like the Facebook story, will create unrealistic expectations for the field, which could ultimately threaten future progress and the responsible application of new technologies.Exaggerated claims in the press about the intelligence of computers is not unique to our time, and in fact goes back to the very origins of computing itself.In February 1946, when the school bus-sized, cumbersome Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (Eniac) was presented to the media at a press conference, journalists described it as an “electronic brain”, a “mathematical Frankenstein”, a “predictor and controller of weather” and a “wizard”. In an attempt to tamp down some of the hype around the new machine, renowned British physicist DR Hartree published an article in Nature describing how the Eniac worked in a straightforward and unsensational way.Much to his dismay, the London Times published a story that drew heavily on his research titled An Electronic Brain: Solving Abstruse Problems Valves with a Memory. Hartree immediately responded with a letter to the editor, saying that the term “electronic brain” was misleading and that the machine was “no substitute for human thought”, but the damage was done – the Eniac was forever known by the press as the “brain machine”.It was a similar story in the United States after Frank Rosenblatt, an engineer at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, presented a rudimentary machine-learning algorithm called the “perceptron” to the press in 1958. While the “perceptron” could only be trained to recognize a limited range of patterns, the New York Times published an article claiming that the algorithm was an “electronic brain” that could “teach itself”, and would one day soon “be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its own existence”.While the giddy hype around AI helped generate funding for researchers at universities and in the military, by the end of the 1960s it was becoming increasingly obvious to many AI pioneers that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of simulating the human brain in machines. In 1969, Marvin Minsky, who had pronounced only eight years earlier that machines would surpass humans in general intelligence in his lifetime, co-authored a book with Seymour Papert proving that Rosenblatt’s perceptron could not do as much the experts had once promised and was nowhere near as intelligent as the media had let on.Minsky and Papert’s book suffused the research community with a contagious doubt that spread to other fields, leading the way for an outpouring AI myth debunking. In 1972, the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus published an influential screed against thinking machines called What Computers Can’t Do, and a year later the British mathematician James Lighthill produced a report on the state of machine intelligence, which concluded that “in no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised”.This trough of disillusionment ushered in what has since been called the first AI winter, a period in which funding for research in the field dropped off almost entirely. The media, which had drummed up so many inflated expectations for “electronic brains”, also lost interest. While there were small resurgences in the 1980s and 1990s, AI was more or less a topic relegated to the realm of corny sci-fi novelists – computer scientists often avoided the term artificial intelligence altogether for fear of being viewed as “wild-eyed dreamers”.The ice of AI’s first winter only fully retreated at the beginning of this decade after a new generation of researchers started publishing papers about successful applications of a technique called “deep learning”.While this was fundamentally a decades-old statistical technique similar to Rosenblatt’s perceptron, increases in computational power and availability of huge data sets meant that deep learning was becoming practical for tasks such as speech recognition, image recognition and language translation. As reports of deep learning’s “unreasonable effectiveness” circulated among researchers, enrollments at universities in machine-learning classes surged, corporations started to invest billions of dollars to find talent familiar with the newest techniques, and countless startups attempting to apply AI to transport or medicine or finance were founded.As this resurgence got under way, AI hype in the media resumed after a long hiatus. In 2013, John Markoff wrote a feature in the New York Times about deep learning and neural networks with the headline Brainlike Computers, Learning From Experience. Not only did the title recall the media hype of 60 years earlier, so did some of the article’s assertions about what was being made possible by the new technology. “In coming years,” Markoff wrote, “the approach will make possible a new generation of artificial intelligence systems that will perform some function that humans do with ease: see, speak, listen, navigate, manipulate and control.”Since then, far more melodramatic and overblown articles about “AI apocalypse”, “artificial brains”, “artificial superintelligence” and “creepy Facebook bot AIs” have filled the news feed daily.Lipton, a jazz saxophonist who decided to undertake a PhD in machine learning to challenge himself intellectually, says that as these hyped-up stories proliferate, so too does frustration among researchers with how their work is being reported on by journalists and writers who have a shallow understanding of the technology.What Lipton finds most troubling, though, is not technical illiteracy among journalists, but how social media has allowed self-proclaimed “AI influencers” who do nothing more than paraphrase Elon Musk on their Medium blogs to cash in on this hype with low-quality, TED-style puff pieces. “Making real progress in AI requires a public discourse that is sober and informed,” Lipton says. “Right now, the discourse is so completely unhinged it’s impossible to tell what’s important and what’s not.”Lipton is not the first person to express concern about the new AI hype cycle and where it is taking the field. Last year, the pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks wrote an article criticizing the “hysteria about the future of artificial intelligence” for MIT Technology Review. In 2013, New York University professor Gary Marcus wrote an article for the New Yorker in which he argued that the hype will create unrealistic expectations followed by disillusionment leading to another AI winter.But for Lipton, the problem with the current hysteria is not so much the risk of another winter, but more how it promotes stories that distract from pressing issues in the field. “People are afraid about the wrong things,” he says. “There are policymakers earnestly having meetings to discuss the rights of robots when they should be talking about discrimination in algorithmic decision making. But this issue is terrestrial and sober, so not many people take an interest.”In March last year, Lipton started his own blog to try to counter-balance and deconstruct some of the most damaging sensationalist AI news. So far, he has called out a “low-quality” profile of Elon Musk in Vanity Fair and an uncritical overview of Anthony Levandowski’s so-called AI church, among others.The blog has received some attention from the media and has a regular readership, but Lipton knows that his influence is limited. “What really needs to happen is better training of journalists and more integrity,” he says. “Until that happens, my blog is just a pebble in the rapids of crap. I’m not altering the direction of the stream.”Joanne McNeil, a writer who examines emerging technologies, agrees that there is a problem with uncritical, uninquiring tech journalism, and often uses Twitter to make fun of Terminator-style articles. But at the same time, she is weary of pointing the finger solely at journalists and believes that one of the causes of AI hype is an uneven distribution of resources.“If you compare a journalist’s income to an AI researcher’s income,” she says, “it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly why it is impossible for journalists to produce the type of carefully thought through writing that researchers want done about their work.” She adds that while many researchers stand to benefit from hype, as a writer who wants to critically examine these technologies, she only suffers from it. “There are few outlets interested in publishing nuanced pieces and few editors who have the expertise to edit them,” she says. “If AI researchers really care about being covered thoughtfully and critically, they should come together and fund a publication where writers can be suitably paid for the time that it takes to really dig in.”While closer interaction between journalists and researchers would be a step in the right direction, Genevieve Bell, a professor of engineering and computer science at the Australian National University, says that stamping out hype in AI journalism is not possible. Bell explains that this is because articles about electronic brains or pernicious Facebook bots are less about technology and more about our cultural hopes and anxieties.“We’ve told stories about inanimate things coming to life for thousands of years, and these narratives influence how we interpret what is going on now,” Bell says. “Experts can be really quick to dismiss how their research makes people feel, but these utopian hopes and dystopian fears have to be part of the conversations. Hype is ultimately a cultural expression that has its own important place in the discourse.”Ultimately, Lipton agrees that there is a place for speculative writing about AI and he acknowledges how imagination and emotion can motivate inquiry in the field. “But I also think that boundary between wild speculation and real research is a little too flimsy right now,” he says. “As history shows us, this is a boundary that needs to be monitored so we can distinguish between what’s important in the here and now and what’s just fantasy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60b174ac3defe541e3181b62e8b830040238912/0_2096_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9e8a3e1962d54141e5b660ce0f381a6","title":"jamaica womens decorum rule review short sleeves","story":"Government to assess policies where women wearing sleeveless shirts, flip-flops, short skirts and shorts are barred entryBefore making a trip to visit her daughter in Trinidad and Tobago, the Jamaican author Melanie Schwapp needed to get a yellow fever shot.But when she arrived for her appointment at a government-run health clinic, she was turned away by a security guard who told her she could not be admitted because she was wearing a sleeveless shirt.“I find it ridiculous,” says Schwapp. “If you are dressing decently, what is the problem if your shoulders are exposed?”Her experience mirrored those of many women in Jamaica, who are routinely turned away from hospitals, libraries, clinics and government buildings on the grounds that their clothing has infringed a “decorum rule”.Now the country’s government has now ordered a review of the unofficial policies under which women are barred entry for wearing sleeveless shirts or blouses – as well as flip-flops, short skirts or shorts.Jamaican prime minister Andrew Holness announced earlier this month that he had ordered Babsy Grange, the minister of sports, culture, entertainment and gender affairs, to review the practice. “As a modern society, we must evolve,” he wrote on Twitter.The debate over the “decorum rule” was reignited after Theresa May wore a sleeveless gown during Donald Trump’s visit the UK – prompting women to point out that the British prime minister would probably not be allowed to enter a Jamaican school or hospital wearing the same dress.Women often express frustration with the custom, which can cause extreme inconvenience in a Caribbean country where temperatures regularly exceed 30C (86F).After lodging a string of access to information requests, local activist Susan Goffe found there was no legal basis or government policy to justify the “rule”, which many see as a remnant of colonial attitudes. “It has always struck me as being a ridiculous rule to apply in a tropical country,” said Goffe. But beyond the absurdity, Goffe warned the rule can result in women being denied public services.“Denial of public services on account of dress must contravene the charter of rights of our constitution,” said local human rights activist Carol Narcisse.Some of Jamaica’s churches support the practice, claiming a requirement for modesty.But others are scathing in their response to such arbitrary rules. Shawn Gregory was recently turned away from visiting her ailing father in hospital because she was wearing a sleeveless top."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576428.1532545139!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"block on east west border non negotiable says hammond","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond (second left) meets local MPs and business leaders during his visit to the Magee campus of Ulster University in Derry. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePreventing an “east-west border” between Northern Ireland and Britain is as non-negotiable for the UK in the Brexit talks as avoiding a “North-South” Border is for the EU, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer has said. During a rare visit to the North, Mr Hammond said he did not agree with Tánaiste Simon Coveney’s view that the British government could not afford a “no deal Brexit”.“I think there is no doubt that Britain would be better off with a deal than without a deal. But I don’t think we are sliding to towards no deal,” he said. Mr Hammond said the recent British White Paper, which sought to reconcile how to avoid borders, was a “constructive move forward” and could be engaged with by both the British and EU.“I very much hope over next few months we are going to see rapid progress towards a shared vision of what the future relationship can look like and of course putting in place the Irish backstop arrangements which are a crucial part of the overall package.”Mr Hammond said he was sure that the long-running row over the possibility of a hard Border was not being “hyped up”. “One of the challenges we have had over the past few months is getting the EU to understand that no east-west border is as non-negotiable a part of this picture as no North-South border is for them,” he told reporters. “The no east-west border is equally non-negotiable from the point of view of British Conservatives and unionists. I certainly would not be prepared to sign up to any solution that involved an east-west border between Northern Ireland and GB.”As a Remainer during the EU referendum debate, he acknowledged there were tensions on Brexit within the Conservatives but did not think that it would lead to the implosion of the party. He said “no one disagrees with the direction of travel, that we are leaving the EU and seeking to get the best deal we can with the EU”. On the restoration of powersharing, he said that during an earlier meeting with financial services executives in Belfast he “sensed frustration and a concern that if the situation were to go on it would exact a toll on inward investment and confidence by foreign firms who are investing here”.He said US chief executives of firms based in the North also told him it was “very difficult to explain to their corporate leaders in the US what it means and how it works to be in a place that has no political governance”.“We have to go forward, we have to get back to the powersharing arrangements that have delivered such progress over past 20 years.”Mr Hammond’s visit to Belfast and Derry raised suspicions among some nationalists that an attempt was being made to deflect attention from the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in London on Wednesday. The DUP had described the conference as a “talking shop” and some suspected Mr Hammond’s arrival was a sop to the party, which is keeping Theresa May’s government afloat.The chancellor denied this was the case and said he was there to announce £12 million in funding for a Bombardier factory and also to talk to financial services executives and to meet academics at Ulster University in Derry. Mr Hammond said he had invited “a city deal” bid from Derry whereby the local council, university and businesses were given the chance to submit plans to the British government on their priorities for economic growth in the region. The British government already is investing more than £1.6 billion in city deals in Scotland and Wales and is in negotiations for a Belfast city deal."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3575294.1532450517!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"etiquette is all in punjab club as political intrigues reach crescendo","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupporters of Imran Khan, head of the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf  party, listen to his speech at an election rally in Karachi, Pakistan, in recent days. Pakistan is to hold general and provincial elections on  July 25th. Photograph: Shahzaib AkberEPATwo cats are fighting under a peepal tree in the gardens of the Punjab Club, a screeching whirl of black and ginger momentarily disturbing the genteel tranquillity of Pakistan’s most exclusive private members’ club.This is where the cream of the country’s elite exchange high-society gossip over single malt and cigars in the antiquated confines of the Oak Room, with its displays of pistols and crossed swords, their every whim attended to by waiters in turbans. Steeped in memories of the Raj, they seek refuge from the present-day political turmoil.“So good to see you.”“Where have you been?”“It’s been so long!”Voices echoing in the marbled lobby, they greet each other in English before launching into Urdu, these politicians, judges, lawyers and business people. Beneath the crystal chandeliers, they hold muted discussions on an allegedly dirty election blighted by rumours of military backing for cricketing legend Imran Khan. It’s a contest that could upend the current order, break the duopoly of the country’s two political dynasties: the Bhuttos and the Sharifs.The stakes are high, but voices are never raised. Etiquette is everything. Decorum rules.At lunch, I sit next to two men representing different strands of the elite, the air fragrant with tuberose, vaguely wondering if I’ve selected the right fork for the rondelles of pink meat studded with olives.Farid, a businessman from one of the country’s most prestigious families, signed me in. His loyalties are with Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. Like Khan, he attended nearby Aitchison College, the Eton of Pakistan. The old boys’ network is alive and well, even if the mercurial politician has turned his back on his debonair past, making new chums like Amir Liaquat Hussain, a religious hardliner with a penchant for accusing liberals of blasphemy.But the old chums don’t forget. Khan’s power push might not be quite cricket, but they cling to the belief he will make good on his promises of creating, well ... a country that works.“The true Imran will emerge,” says Farid.Sitting next to us is Ashtar, a gimlet-eyed former attorney general, said to have the ear of ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif would have been standing against Khan if he hadn’t been jailed for corruption. Ashtar is now providing legal counsel to members of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which is being targeted in an industrial-scale corruption crackdown on the old guard. He terms it a “judicial coup”.“The caretakers have become undertakers for Nawaz and the cradle rockers for Imran,” he declares. It’s not idle talk. Ashtar fought for an independent judiciary during the military dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf, landing in jail, where he suffered a heart attack.We all look out the floor-to-ceiling windows, beyond the phoenix palms to the shimmering waters of the club’s pool. “The fish is good,” says Farid, looking slightly queasy.With Farid’s help, I book a night in one of the sedately furnished rooms, which gives me access to the main attraction. After a refreshing swim, I chat to one of the club’s female members, who works as a psychologist. It’s so hard to work out what’s going on in this country where “tables can be turned at any moment”. But, by the sound of things, it’s harder still to understand Imran Khan.The psychologist supported Khan in the last election. No matter what, Khan is still “one of us”, she says. But his erratic taste in women disturbs her. British heiress Jemima Goldsmith, mother of Khan’s two sons, is considered his true love. Then came Reham Khan, a former BBC weather presenter, who has just dished the dirt on their 10-month marriage in a pre-election book, alleging drug-abuse and philandering. And now he’s with Bushra Maneka, a spiritual healer, who appeared in recent wedding photos with her entire face covered by a red veil.What is Khan playing at? The Lahore elite know him. And they know Bushra is not his type of woman. He’s searching for something he can only find within, says the psychologist.We could talk Imran all day long, but there’s something I need to know, something that goes deeper than the current political intrigues. In the Teak Room, over tankards of sharp Murree beer, I quiz Farid and Ashtar on Pakistan’s post-colonial identity. How did the Pakistani elite come to adopt an institution symbolic of Empire’s worst excesses, the sort of place that would have once had a sign saying “No dogs or Indians” at the entrance?The pair immediately warm to the subject. Ashtar says that top-ranking local administrators, the so-called “brown sahibs”, needed to retain power and order in the bloody chaos of partition. He understands that the notion might be perplexing. After all, the Brits dressed the waiters in those turbans to humiliate the Mughal nawabs. “It was out of spite,” he says. “If I had my way, I’d make them wear bow ties.”Why doesn’t he present a motion to the board?“I might just do that,” he says, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.In the 71 years of Pakistan’s often violent history, the Punjab Club has served a purpose, proving a refuge where views can be freely expressed. “Respect for other peoples’ opinions is like a balm,” says Ashtar.Only the cats serve as a brief reminder of the wild world outside the high walls. A waiter sends them scarpering with a well-aimed straw broom.And peace returns – for an afternoon, at least."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576207.1532530527!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk should take reassurance and comfort from brexit preparations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: UK Prime Minister has said her government is being “responsible and sensible” in Brexit negotiations Photograph: Matt DunhamReutersThe UK public should take “reassurance and comfort” from its government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit, Theresa May has said after ministers suggested food and medicines would be stockpiled in case of shortages.In an interview with 5 News on Wednesday, the Prime Minister did not deny stockpiling is happening, but said the government is being “responsible and sensible” while still trying to get a good deal with the European Union.It came after health secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday he had asked officials to “work up options for stockpiling” by the pharmaceutical industry, and Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said the government would also take steps to ensure an “adequate food supply”.Mrs May said: “Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal – I believe we can get a good deal – but . . . because we don’t know what the outcome is going to be . . . let’s prepare for every eventuality.“This is not just about stockpiling. That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.”Mrs May’s comments came as a new poll suggests trust in her ability to handle Brexit is falling.A ICM poll found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal, down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 general election.Chancellor Philip Hammond said it is “sensible and responsible” that the Government is working with industry to stockpile certain vital supplies for the event of a no-deal.Speaking during a visit to the Bombardier aircraft factory in Belfast on Wednesday, he said: “That’s a sensible and responsible thing for a Government to do and large businesses who are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans, and we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.”Mr Hammond also ruled out extending the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate withdrawal from the EU, after the Irish Government said it would back such a move.He said Parliament had legislated for the current exit date in March after suggestions an extension could help avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit taking place.It came as talks continued in Brussels, with a meeting between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Mr Raab scheduled for Thursday.Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she had taken personal charge of the negotiations, with Mr Raab “deputising” for her in Brussels.Tory Eurosceptics have voiced concerns that Mr Raab’s department has been sidelined by Number 10 and Ms May’s Europe adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that isions within the Conservative camp may result in no deal.Mr Coveney confirmed Dublin is making contingency plans to cope with Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, but he told BBC Radio 4’s Today that Dublin would “absolutely” back an extension if Ms May’s Government asked for it.Speaking outside Parliament in London after the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the Tánaiste said a no-deal Brexit is not in British or Irish best interests, but he remains confident a deal will be reached.He said: “We need to be focusing on the intensification of negotiations to try and find the solutions on a way forward as opposed to the sort of tough stance that some people feel the need to take in relation to saying ‘well do your worst, we can deal with a (no-deal) situation’. That isn’t going to solve this problem.” – Press Association"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Unconditional offers \u0026#39undermine credibility\u0026#39 of higher education, universities minister warnsDutch doctor reprimanded for \u0026#39asking family to hold down euthanasia patient\u0026#39Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker agree deal to stave off trade warPrince Charles aide asked police if anything could \u0026#39embarrass\u0026#39 him during inquiry into paedophile bishopAt least 31 killed as Pakistan election day overshadowed by deadly suicide bombing in QuettaLiam Fox indicates he would have quit if Chequers plan kept UK in customs unionTeacher living next to \u0026#39legal\u0026#39 red light district was raped by man who believed she was a prostitute Picnic at Hanging Rock, episode 3 review: ghastly funCabinet\u0026#39s rift over death penalty waiver for Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 revealedDonald Trump postpones second meeting with Vladimir Putin until Russia investigation concludesFather of boy, 3, among five men to appear in court charged over \u0026#39acid attack\u0026#39Fears that some migrant children in US will never be reunited with their parents as deadline looms\u0026#39Take comfort\u0026#39 from plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case of no deal Brexit, says Theresa MayTrump and EU\u0026#39s Juncker say they are working together to reduce tariffs in White House meeting Lord Haw-Haw: The story of the last traitor in Britain hanged for treasonHow to sleep well during the heatwave: don\u0026#39t sleep naked and chill your socks in the fridgeSeagram heiress arrested as part of case against Nxivm \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39German employment minister bucks Europe trend and calls for more immigrationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Prior to launching a political career that could see him become the country\u0027s new prime minister, Khan - who retired from the sport in 1992  - led Pakistan to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup, Pakistan\u0027s first and only victory in that competition.Host Evan Davis later apologised for the mix-upDuring his international career, he made 3,807 runs and took 362 wickets in Test cricket, and in 2010 was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.Akram, meanwhile, has remained in the sport since his retirement and spends much of his time commentating on the game.As a left-arm fast bowler, he was the first to reach the 500-wicket mark in One Day International cricket during the 2003 World Cup and also took more than 400 wickets for his country in Tests.Please review our commenting policyUnconditional offers \u0026#39undermine credibility\u0026#39 of higher education, universities minister warnsDutch doctor reprimanded for \u0026#39asking family to hold down euthanasia patient\u0026#39Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker agree deal to stave off trade warPrince Charles aide asked police if anything could \u0026#39embarrass\u0026#39 him during inquiry into paedophile bishopAt least 31 killed as Pakistan election day overshadowed by deadly suicide bombing in QuettaLiam Fox indicates he would have quit if Chequers plan kept UK in customs unionTeacher living next to \u0026#39legal\u0026#39 red light district was raped by man who believed she was a prostitute Picnic at Hanging Rock, episode 3 review: ghastly funCabinet\u0026#39s rift over death penalty waiver for Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 revealedDonald Trump postpones second meeting with Vladimir Putin until Russia investigation concludesFather of boy, 3, among five men to appear in court charged over \u0026#39acid attack\u0026#39Fears that some migrant children in US will never be reunited with their parents as deadline looms\u0026#39Take comfort\u0026#39 from plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case of no deal Brexit, says Theresa MayTrump and EU\u0026#39s Juncker say they are working together to reduce tariffs in White House meeting Lord Haw-Haw: The story of the last traitor in Britain hanged for treasonHow to sleep well during the heatwave: don\u0026#39t sleep naked and chill your socks in the fridgeSeagram heiress arrested as part of case against Nxivm \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39German employment minister bucks Europe trend and calls for more immigrationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/25/TELEMMGLPICT000170240075_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMnyC4S5FxYt0W1P60ASQfhKi2sT3vi7ux2-RDZwC4QA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"scotland faces gold rush uks largest nugget discovered river","story":"Gold expert Leon Kirk examines the record breaking gold nugget found in a Scottish riverDumfries and GallowayThe largest gold nugget found in British waters for 500 years has been discovered by a man lying face down in a river in Scotland.The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, came across the 85.7g (2.75 Troy ounces) lump with a method called \u0027sniping\u0027, in which the prospector uses a snorkel to lie face down in the water and search the riverbed. Named the Douglas Nugget, it is expected to be worth at least £50,000.The discovery was made two years ago but its precise location remains a secret to avoid Scotland\u0027s biggest gold rush in years. Upon finding the nugget the man - in his 40s - ran from the water clutching his gold shouting “bingo”.Finally breaking his silence, he said: “I was following a crack in the bedrock and found around 2g in fine gold.“This then led to a pocket, where I uncovered the nugget. I called over my friend to have a look and we both assumed it to be around 5-7g in weight.“It wasn\u0027t until I removed it that we realised just how big it was.”He added: “I took off my glove and picked it up, jumped out of the water and screamed, \u0027Bingo!\u0027 to my friend.“We were both stunned and couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime.”A crack in the bedrock of the river showed a fine line of gold and led to a large pocket containing the huge chunkThe man, who has been looking for gold as a hobby for 20 years, is unsure what to do with his find and is currently keeping it in a safety deposit box - but there is a danger the Crown Estate could claim the proceeds if it is sold.Under law, gold and silver are classed as Mines Royal, meaning that in most cases they belong to the Crown. Permission from The Crown Estate is required to take away any gold that is found, regardless of the method used to find it. It is not clear whether permission has been granted. Leon Kirk, from Gold Panning Supplies UK, and friend of the successful prospector, said that while they were concerned that giving away the location of the river could cause a huge gold rush, his friend was also keen to keep his find a secret to allow him to fully search the river. The technique used to find it is called sniping, where the treasure hunter lies face down in the water with a snorkel and goggles“It’s a bit of a secret society, gold panning, when you find a good river,” he said. “I know this guy has spent the last two years looking through the rest of the river where he found this huge nugget.“He’s found lots of other pieces of gold since so that’s probably why he’s kept it quiet - you wouldn’t want to give something like that away. “I think we’re both of the view as well that telling people where it was could ruin the river - but I don’t even know where he found it.”Although he does not know exactly where the gold was found, Mr Kirk recommended that people scour Wanlockhead in Dumfries, Galloway where gold nuggets have been discovered before. In 2015 a £10,000 nugget, which weighed approximately 18 grams, was found near Wanlockhead. Mr Kirk added: “This is a very exciting and unprecedented find. But the nugget\u0027s rarity means it is very hard to put a price on it.“I would say it is worth at least £50,000 but, as it\u0027s rarer than a Aston Martin or a Faberge egg, a billionaire could easily come along and pay a lot more for it.“Historically, it is off the Richter scale.”Leon Kirk said the find had been kept quiet to allow the hunter to scour the rest of the riverThe Douglas Nugget is believed to share a similar diameter to that of a 1.6ins golf ball.Dr Neil Clark, author of Scottish Gold: Fruit Of The Nation, believes the shape of the Douglas Nugget could mean there is more gold just waiting to be found close to the mystery location.He said: “The size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far.”But added: “The fact that we have waited over 500 years for this nugget suggests it may be difficult to find another comparable one in the near future.”Dumfries and GallowayPlease review our commenting policyUnconditional offers \u0026#39undermine credibility\u0026#39 of higher education, universities minister warnsDutch doctor reprimanded for \u0026#39asking family to hold down euthanasia patient\u0026#39Donald Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker agree deal to stave off trade warPrince Charles aide asked police if anything could \u0026#39embarrass\u0026#39 him during inquiry into paedophile bishopAt least 31 killed as Pakistan election day overshadowed by deadly suicide bombing in QuettaLiam Fox indicates he would have quit if Chequers plan kept UK in customs unionPicnic at Hanging Rock, episode 3 review: ghastly funTeacher living next to \u0026#39legal\u0026#39 red light district was raped by man who believed she was a prostitute Cabinet\u0026#39s rift over death penalty waiver for Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 revealedDonald Trump postpones second meeting with Vladimir Putin until Russia investigation concludesFather of boy, 3, among five men to appear in court charged over \u0026#39acid attack\u0026#39Fears that some migrant children in US will never be reunited with their parents as deadline looms\u0026#39Take comfort\u0026#39 from plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case of no deal Brexit, says Theresa MayTrump and EU\u0026#39s Juncker say they are working together to reduce tariffs in White House meeting Lord Haw-Haw: The story of the last traitor in Britain hanged for treasonHow to sleep well during the heatwave: don\u0026#39t sleep naked and chill your socks in the fridgeSeagram heiress arrested as part of case against Nxivm \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39German employment minister bucks Europe trend and calls for more immigrationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures top 40 degrees tube passengers told air conditioning","story":"Overheated London Underground passengers have mocked officials who reassured them air conditioning will be installed - in 12 years.Temperatures on the Central Line have hit 40C during the recent heatwave - above the 30C maximum temperature at which you are legally allowed to transport cattle.Thermal imaging by company Flir showed the extent of the heatwave on the underground, as passengers said they felt faint on board.Commuters have complained the temperature is dangerous for the elderly and children, as well as those who are unwell or pregnant. Passenger Giovanni Lepori tweeted: The heat inside trains is reaching levels that are certainly dangerous for elderly people and children and I\u0027d imagine that it\u0027s not healthy for the average person either.

Log inFigures from Nielsen released this week pointed to the strongest UK grocery sales in five years thanks to the heatwave.Separate data from the Kantar Worldpanel also showed supermarket sales spiking over the 12 weeks to the 15 July, with credit given to “the prolonged hot weather”.Yet official data from the Office for National Statistics showed an unexpected fall in retail sales volumes in June, with the agency saying that “consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave”.So is the heatwave likely to boost retail sales, or not?And will it have any positive effect on the wider economy?For the obvious reasons.People buy things they need to cope with or enjoy the hot weather. Kantar says that Britons stocked up on items such as barbecue firelighters, alcohol and sun cream.Domestic tourism can\u0026nbspalso get a\u0026nbspboost.There’s also the feel good factor. If people are happier because of the hot weather the theory is that consumer confidence will be higher and they will spend more in the shops.But economists stress that the economic impact can be ambiguous.“It is a bit of a double edged sword,” says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.“Pubs are taking spend share off restaurants and food spend is also a rotation of spending patterns rather than volume increase.”Mr French is also sceptical of the consumer confidence boost channel.\u0026nbspOther economists point out that hot temperatures can adversely affect workers’ productivity levels.According to the ONS, roughly £400bn\u0026nbspwas spent on retail sales, including fuel, in 2017.Total GDP last year was around £2 trillion, meaning retail sales account for roughly a fifth of the economy.So a decent performance from retail sales in a quarter can deliver a significant boost to overall growth. Indeed, despite the slippage in June, the ONS estimates that over the second quarter retail sales were still up 2.1 per cent.That alone should deliver 0.4 percentage points to second quarter GDP growth.That’s very useful after growth slumped to just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.The UK had a very hot summer in 2003. And GDP grew rapidly in the second half of the year.However there was a marked growth slowdown in 2004, which signals that any household consumption boost was merely expenditure brought forward rather than being additional.The last comparable UK heatwave to the current one was in the summer of 1976.GDP did grow extremely quickly in the second half of that year, rising by 1.2 per cent in the third quarter and 2.1 per cent in the final quarter.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/16/mosque-1.jpg","title":"seyran ates islam mosque religon germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women\u0027s rights activist, could not find a mosque where she felt at home. So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There had been some signs of liquid water currently on Mars, including disputed evidence of water activity on Martian slopes, but not stable bodies of water.The discovery was found by scientists using the\u0026nbspMars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (Marsis) instrument on the Mars Express spacecraft. That instruments sends out radar pulses that penetrate the surface and ice caps on Mars, and measures the radio waves when they come back to the spacecraft.Scientists led by\u0026nbspRoberto Orosei\u0026nbspexamined that data between\u0026nbspMay 2012 and December 2015 and found that there was a very sharp change in the radar signals, when looking at the area, which was found 1.5km beneath the surface.The researchers spent two years ensuring that the data wasn’t the result of some other effect – eventually ruling out every possible explanation apart from liquid water of some kind.“It’s tempting to think that this is the first candidate place where life could persist\u0026nbspon Mars,” said Orosei.The data is similar to that seen when radars look at\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsplakes of liquid water found beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on Earth. Scientists have suggested that microbial life could live in those extreme conditions – as it might on Mars.“This kind of environment is not exactly your ideal vacation, or a place where fish would swim,” Orosei added. “But there are terrestrial organisms that can survive and thrive, in fact, in similar environments. There are microorganisms on Earth that are capable of surviving even in ice.”Scott Hubbard, a professor of astronautics at Stanford University who served as Nasa’s first Mars program director in 2000, called it “tremendously exciting”.\u0026nbsp“Our mantra back then was ‘follow the water’.\u0026nbspThat was the one phrase that captured everything,” Hubbard said. “So this discovery, if it stands, is just thrilling because it’s the culmination of that philosophy.”\u0026nbspIt is even colder on Mars than it is in the Antarctic and Greenland, making the discovery of liquid water even more surprising.The water itself is likely to be a briny sludge. The\u0026nbspsalt that makes that brine is also probably the reason there is liquid water at all, since it helps melt the otherwise icy water in the same way grit is used to remove snow from streets.“This is a stunning result that suggests water on Mars is not a temporary trickle like previous discoveries but a persistent body of water that provides the conditions for life for extended periods of time,” said\u0026nbspAlan Duffy, an astronomer from Swinburne University and the lead scientist of Australia’s Science Channel.There is nothing particularly special about the area where the water was found – it is simply the region on Mars where the radar that made the detection is most sensitive. That means that there could be similar deposits under the ground all the way across Mars.It remains to be seen if more subsurface reservoirs of water will be found or whether the newly discovered one is some sort of quirk, Orosei said.If others are detected and a network of subglacial lakes exists like on Earth, he said, that could indicate liquid water has persisted for millions of years or even dating back to 3.5 billion years ago when Mars was a more hospitable planet.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But in many parts of the country, people have travelled to vote regardless of the security issues.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live blog of the Pakistan election. You can follow all the latest updates throughout the day here.Polls were scheduled to open at 8am local time (3.30am BST)\u0026nbspacross the country, and\u0026nbspwitnesses and national media say that voting is now underway across many polling stations.Voters will decide\u0026nbsptoday between\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspformer cricket legend and playboy\u0026nbspImran Khan, and the party of ex-leader\u0026nbspNawaz Sharif, who has been\u0026nbspjailed on corruption charges that he says are politically motivated.Mr Khan\u0027s PTI\u0026nbspparty has positioned itself as an anti-corruption vehicle\u0026nbspof change - but Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N\u0026nbsphas accused him of being the military\u0027s candidate.While PTI has held a narrow lead in polls leading up to the election, most forecasters are predicting a hung parliament that will require a coalition government.It means that independents and other smaller parties - like the PPP\u0026nbspled by the son of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto - could yet play a key role in coalition.\u0026nbspToday\u0027s vote will be the first time Pakistan has ever achieved a second democratic transition of power in a row. Throughout its history, the country has oscillated between military and civilian rule.Yet while that should be being hailed as an unprecedented landmark of stability for the nation, there are warning signs to be found in a campaign that has been one of the most dangerous and distasteful in modern history.From social media to the streets, the vicious nature of the campaign has polarised Pakistani society into supporters of Mr Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) party, and the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) of Mr Sharif.The chief election commissioner (CEC), retired Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza, on Tuesday assured voters that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was “trying its best to hold free, fair and unbiased elections”.In a video message released by the election body, Mr Raza urged voters to fulfil their “duty towards the nation” by casting their votes calmly and responsibly on polling day.There have been positive landmarks to be found aside from the flurry of recriminations in the campaign. For the first time in history, five trans candidates will be standing for election, and there are also a record 171 women in the running, though they make a small minority of the 12,500 candidates vying for national and provincial seats across the country.Nonetheless, there will be a huge security presence trying to maintain order on the streets on Wednesday, with approximately 800,000 law enforcement and army personnel deployed.Of more than 85,000 polling stations across the country, around 17,000 have been declared “highly sensitive” and will receive special security measures.The majority of these – more than 11,000 – were in the populous Punjab and Sindh provinces, where the election is expected to be won or lost. Rights activists have also expressed concern that soldiers will be positioned inside booths where votes are cast.For Ayesha Siddiqa, a defence analyst and author of a book about the power and financial holdings of Pakistan’s military, the outlook is worrying. She said: “Whatever way elections run, I see a lot of instability.”Today\u0027s isive race is likely to come down to Punjab, the country\u0027s most populous province, where Sharif\u0027s party has clung to its lead in recent surveys.Let\u0027s test Imran as we have been testing others for the last several decades, said first-time voter Yousaf Ali, a 22-year-old medical student who cast his ballot for Khan\u0027s party in the city of Lahore in Punjab.An anti-corruption crusader, Khan has promised an Islamic welfare state and cast his populist campaign as a battle to topple a predatory political elite hindering development in the impoverished mostly-Muslim nation of 208 million people, where the illiteracy rate hovers above 40 percent.We are pitched against mafias, Khan, 65, said in one of his last rallies in the coastal city of Karachi. These are mafias who made money in this country and siphoned it abroad, burying this nation in debt.Pakistan\u0026nbspMuslim League chief Shahbaz Sharif cast his vote in the eastern city of Lahore soon after polls opened in national elections.\u0026nbspSharif, the younger brother of disgraced ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, took over the ruling\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbspMuslim League last year after his brother was found guilty of corruption. The ex-prime minister has since been sentenced to 10 years in jail, which he is serving while appealing the conviction.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAfter voting he told reporters: Do not waste your time. Get out of your homes and cast your vote. We will change the destiny of this country through the power of people. If we come into power, we will end poverty, give education to everyone, make millions of homes and build the Bhasha dam. He added: China and Saudi Arabia are keen to help us.\u0026nbspHe said he believed today people will vote in support of\u0026nbspNawaz Sharif and his daughter\u0026nbspMaryam, who was also jailed, and prove they support democracy.\u0026nbspThe younger Sharif stood in line waiting his turn to enter the polling booth. In\u0026nbspPakistan, a candidate can run for elections in multiple seats. If the candidate wins more than one seat, a by-election will be held as a person can represent only one constituency.\u0026nbspSharif marked his ballot for both the National and Punjab provincial Parliaments and is contesting elections in four National Assembly seats and in two Punjab provincial legislature seats.One dead in shooting between political rivals\u0026nbspPolice have confirmed to The Independent that a party activist has been killed in what is thought to be the first incident of deadly violence on election day.\u0026nbspWe are receiving\u0026nbspinformation from\u0026nbsplocal sources of a shootout in the northwestern city of Sawabi between staff of the PTI and secular Awami National Workers (ANP) parties.\u0026nbspPTI says that one of its activists was killed, and another four people were injured in the incident.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLocal police confirmed that tally, but\u0026nbspsay\u0026nbspthe situation is now under control and voting is back\u0026nbspunderway in Col Sher Khan village.\u0026nbspOther minor incidents have also been reported. In Larkana, Sindh province,\u0026nbspan attack on PPP activists with firecrackers injured a few people, local party management sources said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp18 dead in suicide bombingA blast killed has at least 18 people in the\u0026nbspwestern city of Quetta in an attack targeting a police van, according to local media reports.Geo TV put the death toll at 18, while rival Samaa TV put it at 20, adding a suicide attacker was responsible.A\u0026nbsphospital official says the toll is now 25 killed, 40 wounded in the explosion outside a crowded polling station in Quetta.The blast happened near a polling station, said a Reuters witness in Quetta, capital of\u0026nbspPakistan\u0027s province of Baluchistan, but it was unclear if voting had been disrupted.Television images showed a charred police vehicle, cordoned off by security officials.A spokesman for Quetta hospital, Waseem Baig, told\u0026nbspThe Independent that 15 dead bodies were brought in to the hospital\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp33 injured are under treatment there, a\u0026nbspfew of whom\u0026nbspare in a serious condition.\u0026nbspWitness\u0026nbspMajeed\u0026nbspAkbar said the apparent target of the blast was a police van. He said: The explosion occurred near a school where polling was taking place. There was\u0026nbspa cloud\u0026nbspof smoke after the blast, it filled the sky and then after that I saw a pool of blood, dead bodies and others injured.\u0026nbspAuthorities have yet\u0026nbspto comment\u0026nbspon the\u0026nbspnature of\u0026nbspthe blast.While we wait for more updates on the Quetta bombing, voting has been suspended at the NA-123 polling station in Lahore, after a clash between supporters and members of the PTI and PML-N parties, a local source told The Independent.\u0026nbspLahore, the capital city of the most populous province of Punjab, is the central battlefield between the two main rivals for victory in this election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspQuetta, where the bombing took place a short time ago, is the capital of Baluchistan province.Earler this month, a suicide bomber killed 149 people at an election rally in the town of Mastung, also in Baluchistan province. The attack was claimed by Isis militants.About 371,000 soldiers have been stationed at polling stations across the country to prevent attacks, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013.Isis has claimed responsibility for the bombing in Quetta, in a message shared by the group\u0027s Amaq news agency.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadMr Khan\u0027s\u0026nbspPTI\u0026nbspparty has positioned itself as an anti-corruption vehicle of change - but Mr Sharif\u0027s\u0026nbspPML-N\u0026nbsphas accused him of being the military\u0027s candidate.

Until four years ago Fatima Abu Shedeg was not only unable to swim but had never been in a pool.\u0026nbspYet despite the challenges she has faced, she spends her days dreaming of stepping onto the starting block at\u0026nbspthe Tokyo 2020 Games as Gaza’s first Olympic swimmer.\u0026nbspIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

Bar one person, a young judoka from Jerusalem who qualified in London’s 2012 Games, they have all competed on a wild card scheme.The Palestinian Olympic Committee chooses its teams from Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian communities across the world. So Fatima will face stiff competition while she makes do with scant resources.Gaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the sea.\u0026nbspGaza’s environment authority said last year that nearly two-thirds of its 25 mile coastline was seriously polluted.\u0026nbspSewage treatment plants cannot function due to the power\u0026nbspshortages. The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They love the fact that obviously it is crooked, most of them do believe when they get here it will be just an illusion.“They appreciate the fact that we’ve kept it as it was, with its original features.“The illusion brings a lot of additional trade here at The Crooked House.

Hmmm.The fakes ­market will always ­flourish irrespective of how many originals are pulped.So why doesn’t ­Burberry donate the items to upmarket charity ­auctions where people can bid a lot of money for something they might have bought anyway and have the extra thrill of knowing their cash will go to a deserving cause?Model David Gandy says he was once chucked out of a Hugo Boss catwalk show “because I couldn’t fit any of the clothing”.But luckily for the legion of Mr Gandy’s female fans, he can clearly still squeeze his, ahem, lardy self in to a teeny tiny pair of ­Y-fronts.Nope, still not going to wear them.Former Olympic showjumper Lizzie Purbrick has been telling her side of the story after being convicted of criminal damage for spraying her former lover’s home with several litres of pig’s blood.As you do.Lizzie, 63, says that initially, her relationship with Tory peer Lord Prior was “bloody marvellous” after they “met at a dinner party in Norfolk – the hotbed of sex – and I moved in with him four days later.”Whoa. Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine. I’ve been let out for a cigarette but I’m very bored.”We’ll take that as a no, then.Activity badges for Guides, Rangers and Brownies have been revamped for the 21st Century.You’ll be relieved to know Moped Mugging isn’t one of them, but there’s “Mixology” which involves designing a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails, “Festival Goer”, Vlogging, Mindfulness, Human Rights, Conscious ­Consumer and Media Critic (everyone’s a bloody critic.)

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Soon we\u0027ll be receiving dramatic weekly warnings of the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement as time ticks down to an October deadline. Theresa May has personally taken charge of talks, and will issue 70 \u0027technical notices\u0027 on what\u0027ll happen if we\u0027re rudderless on 29 March 2019. Remainer MP Dominic Grieve has warned No Deal would prompt a state of emergency. Head of the civil service John Manzoni said it\u0027ll have horrendous consequences. Ireland warned even talking about it is inappropriate bravado. But despite all this, Mrs May\u0027s deputy, David Lidington, today boasted No Deal preparations are under way with vim and vigour. And Mrs May said: Far from being worried about preparations that we’re making, I would say people should take reassurance and comfort.    And let\u0027s not forget ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis, who promised it wouldn\u0027t be a Mad Max-style dystopia. So now we\u0027re closer to it actually happening, what do No Deal preparations actually involve? Here are a few of the more alarming ones - and you can guarantee you didn\u0027t see these on the side of a big red bus in 2016. 1. Food would be stockpiled  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiled if we crash out of the EU without a deal. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Mr Raab said further details will be set out in the 70 technical notices over summer. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added today: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s M\u0026ampS stockpiling.  Food safety controls could be suspended at UK borders if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. It would prevent perishable goods being delayed at the border. But it could lead to EU countries blocking exports from the EU because of a cavalier approach to safety standards. Academics say they have been informed by a Government adviser of the plans being developed should delays emerge. Their testimony was contained this week in the Food Research Collaboration briefing, Feeding Britain: Food Security After Brexit . We have learned from a senior Government adviser that plans are being prepared to \u0027suspend food controls\u0027 if there are any delays to imports of perishable foods at our borders, they wrote.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patients if there\u0027s no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lifesaving drugs if ports are blocked, meaning they can\u0027t be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: We\u0027re working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He added he was currently assessing how many months worth of medicines needed to be stockpiled, saying: We\u0027re also focussing on the importance of a continuous supply of medicines that have a short shelf-life. Some of the medicines that are most difficult to provide in a no deal scenario, where there is difficult access through ports, will need to be flown in, for instance. 37 million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry.  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - as he revealed the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, even if those scenarios are very unlikely. 5. Barges in the sea could have to keep the lights on  Plans emerged earlier this month to requisition thousands of generators from the Army and float them in the Irish Sea to keep Northern Ireland\u0027s lights on. The scheme was revealed in a government document seen by the Financial Times. It\u0027s because Northern Ireland and the Republic have a shared electricity supply and market under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. In a worst-case scenario, it\u0027s claimed the Republic could cut off power to the north. After all, Irish Premier Leo Varadkar has already threatened to ban British planes from Irish airspace. He sparked a backlash after saying: The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the Single European Sky and if they leave the EU they are not. If they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account.”  Around 7million people a year face going to the Post Office and paying a \u0026pound5.50 fee to take a day trip to France if there is a no deal Brexit. The National Audit Office revealed a plan to massively ramp up the number of International Driving Permits if the UK fails to reach agreement with the EU. Currently, Brits need the \u0026pound5.50 permits to drive in more than 140 countries outside the EU - and about 100,000 are issued per year. But serious backup plans are now under way to issue them to drivers who go to the EU too, the NAO said. This would hugely increase the number of IDPs issued per year, from 100,000 to an estimated 7million. The number of Post Offices that issue the permits would also have to increase massively, from the current 89 to 4,500 across the country. The NAO issued a blunt warning suggesting the plan may not be ready because as yet, there is no business case and no detailed delivery plans.  The M26 motorway - which joins London orbital M25 with the M20 port highway through Kent - could be turned into a 10-mile lorry park for 1,400 trucks. The plans are under consideration within government, according to the Financial Times, and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab refused to deny their existence. He said: Well, no, but of course. If we have no deal, we want to make sure that we’re prepared at the border for the knock on effects that would have if on the EU side they take the worst case scenario approach, which is frankly irrational.

The BBC presenter accused Theresa May of being “unable to resolve” the “mess” the UK is in as it prepares to exit the EU. And he backed campaigners who have demanded millions of Brits get a say on the final deal.  The 57-year-old ex-footballer said: “I spent most of the last few weeks totally focused on a fantastic World Cup. But it was impossible to avoid what was happening in the Brexit debate back home.  “Now I’m back I find the whole thing more bewildering and worrying than ever. Whether you voted Leave or Remain, did anyone really vote for the mess we seem to be in, let alone the prospect of no deal with all the terrible consequences attached to that.  “There are some things in life that, even for someone like me, are more important than football. This is one of them. “I am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed. “The politicians seem unable to resolve the problem the people gave them in voting to Leave. That is why I think there should be a People’s Vote on the final deal, and why I am sending best wishes and good luck to the campaigners who will be stepping up the pressure over the summer.” Meanwhile, Theresa May today insisted the British public should take “comfort” from the fact the government is stockpiling blood and food in preparation for a no deal Brexit. The Prime Minister said her government was doing the “responsible” and “sensible” thing and not trying to alarm people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs his department is working with industry “for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit”. He added: “This includes the chain of medical supplies, vaccines, medical devices, clinical consumables, blood products.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa says you should take","story":"NewsTheresa May says you should take \u0027reassurance and comfort\u0027 in plan to stockpile food for no deal BrexitThe Prime Minister says Government preparations for a no-deal Brexit are a good thing\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter20:46, 25 JUL 2018Updated21:21, 25 JUL 2018News (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Theresa May says the British public should take \u0027reassurance and comfort\u0027 in the Government\u0027s plans to stockpile food and medicines for a no-deal Brexit .  In an interview with 5 News on Wednesday, the Prime Minister did not deny stockpiling is happening, but said the Government is being responsible and sensible while still trying to get a good deal with the European Union. It came after Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday he had asked officials to work up options for stockpiling by the pharmaceutical industry, and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government would also take steps to ensure an adequate food supply.  Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney had earlier said he does not believe that Britain can afford a no-deal Brexit, and he hit out at bravado from Brexiteers who claim such a scenario would be acceptable. Mrs May said: Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but... because we don\u0027t know what the outcome is going to be... let\u0027s prepare for every eventuality. This is not just about stockpiling. That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.  Mrs May\u0027s comments came as a new poll suggests trust in her ability to handle Brexit is falling.  A /ICM poll found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal, down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 general election.  Chancellor Philip Hammond said it is sensible and responsible that the Government is working with industry to stockpile certain vital supplies for the event of a no-deal. Speaking during a visit to the Bombardier aircraft factory in Belfast on Wednesday, he said: That\u0027s a sensible and responsible thing for a Government to do and large businesses who are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans, and we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.

The national election sees former cricket star Imran Khan go head to head with the party of jailed ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif denies wrongdoing and alleges the powerful military and judicial establishment engineered his downfall. He has urged his supporters to give his party, now led by his brother, a second consecutive term. The election will be only the second civilian transfer of power in Pakistan\u0027s 71-year history. Here’s everything you need to know about the elections in Pakistan, who’s standing, who’s likely to win and when we’ll know the result.  Former cricketer Imran Khan is Chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, and their candidate for Prime Minister. He retired from cricket in 1992, as one of Pakistan’s all-time most successful players. An anti-corruption crusader, Khan has promised an Islamic welfare state and cast his populist campaign as a battle to topple a predatory political elite hindering development in the impoverished mostly-Muslim nation of 208 million people, where the illiteracy rate hovers above 40 percent. This is the most important election in Pakistan\u0027s history, Khan, 65, said after casting his vote in the capital, Islamabad. I ask everyone today - be a citizen, cherish this country, worry about this country, use your vote. Khan has staunchly denied allegations by Sharif\u0027s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party that he is getting help from the military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half of its history and still sets key security and foreign policy in the nuclear-armed nation. The army has also dismissed allegations of meddling in the election.  Shehbaz Sharif is the current President of the Pakistan Muslim League-N in May completed his third term as the Chief Minister of Punjab. He’s the brother of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was jailed on corruption charges this month. Sharif\u0027s PML-N has been hoping its delivery of mega infrastructure projects, especially roads and power stations that helped hugely reduce electricity blackouts, would win over. If we get the opportunity, we will change the destiny of Pakistan, said Shehbaz, as he cast his vote in Lahore. We will bring an end to unemployment, eradicate poverty and promote education.

While many of us have air-conditioned offices to cool down in during the working day, the Office of National Statistics claim 50% of working Brits do not enjoy such a luxury. Patrolling police officers, guardsmen, road workers and even coffee shop staff are all ranked as some of the hottest jobs to undertake during the blisteringly hot weather sweeping the country. And it doesn\u0027t look like things will be getting easier any time soon, with the Met Office predicting some areas could reach 37C by Friday - making it the hottest ever temperature recorded in the UK.  Using a CAT thermal imaging smartphone, these images show just how hot some of Britain\u0027s workers get while plying their trade in the brutal heatwave.   Ironmongers   While ironmongers are subjected to pretty toasty temperatures all year round, the conditions seen in White Eagle Forge in Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex, were exceptionally swealtering. The forge itself reached 112\u0026degC and thermal imaging revealed just how hard their protective clothing is working – shielding the workers from residual heat in the early 80\u0026degC’s.

Standing at Brighton Beach, working temperatures for this lifeguard reached a tropical 39C, with the lifeguard stand rising to 46C.  Barista   Making hot drinks in hot temperatures can only lead to one thing - hot workers. Baristas at coffee shops in London and Tunbridge were feeling the heat when their working environment ranged between 33C and 38C, with their coffee machines reaching an incredible 60C.  Dry cleaner   A dry cleaning store is usually fitted with dozens of washing and drying machines - kicking out some serious heat. This dry cleaners in Tunbridge Wells saw the mercury rising to 37C, with machinery reaching almost 100C.  Delivery drivers   Delivery drivers spend most of their time in stuffy cars or outside in the baking hot sunshine riding motorbikes or carrying parcels and knocking doors. A Deliveroo courier in London hit 35C whilst the a DHL van courier reached 36C.  Farmer  This sheep farmer in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was working at 35\u0026degC with the camera showing the amount of heat trapped in the barn by the corrugated iron roofing.  Armed Police   Armed police are required to wear thick, heavy uniforms and carry an incredible amount of weight as they patrol streets and stations. The body temperature of armed police patrolling in central London hit 35C, whilst their bullet proof vest reached an astonishing 61C.  Air conditioning fitter   While he may be helping others to escape the heat, it’s certainly hot work to install this air conditioning unit. He reached 35C, with the thermal camera showing the air conditioning machines at 43\u0026degC-53\u0026degC.  Kebab shop worker   Cooking food at home might raise anyone\u0027s temperature by a degree or two, but some people spend their entire working days over hot ovens.

The couple, who do not wish to be named, arrived back at their Amsterdam house to find odd stains on the carpet and furniture. They claimed their entire house was left in a disgusting state, and were only made aware of what happened when police informed them they had visited the property. The couple said: There were white spots on the couch too and we did not really know what it could be. Unfortunately, the police then informed us about what the stains were.  The couple said police told them they had checked out the house after seeing the address listed in multiple ads on sex and prostitution websites. They said officers found three prostitutes in the house. They ordered them to close the unlicensed brothel, and gave them a few days to vacate the property. Cops say their powers were limited as the prostitutes were not illegal immigrants and were not the victims of human trafficking or forced prostitution. Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, but sex workers and brothels have to be strictly regulated.  The couple had hired a specialist rental agency to hand the house keys to their Airbnb guests. The couple now say their house no longer feels like home knowing that men had sex with prostitutes in almost every room. They have been sleeping on an air bed because they cannot bear the thought of what had happened in their own bed.

Loujain Al-Hathloul, 28, is among nine women held during a brutal crackdown in May just as the desert kingdom was about to allow women to drive for the first time. At the time campaigners were bidding to use the lifting of the driving ban as a springboard for further reforms such as ending Saudi Arabia’s restrictive male ship system and allowing more freedom of speech. But instead they were rounded up, thrown in jail and now face charges of treason that carry the harshest prison sentence, or even the death penalty. Kareem Chehayeb, Saudi Arabia researcher for Amnesty International, said: The Saudi authorities don’t want any change to come from below. They want to stifle any form of dissent or human rights activism.  It appears that the only reforms that are acceptable are those that are coming from above, which is absolutely outrageous. Al-Hathloul’s arrest came two years after she attended a One Young World humanitarian summit with the then Meghan Markle, Emma Watson, Cher as well as the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. In one picture Meghan was in a group of four posing by the water’s edge with Al-Hathloul, the poet Fatima Bhutto and former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson. Writing about the summit at the time Meghan said: One Young World invites young adults from all over the world who are actively working to transform the socio-political landscape by being the greater good.  They are delegates who are speaking out against human rights violations, environmental crises, gender equality issues, discrimination and injustice. They are the change. In March al-Hathloul, who has 316,000 Twitter followers, was stopped by police as she drove near her university in Abu Dhabi and put on a plane back to Saudi Arabia where she was banned from leaving the country or using social media. Despite not posting any more Tweets, she was among seven Saudis detained two months later, five women and two men who had supported their cause, including a lawyer who had represented al-Hathloul in the past. Yesterday Amnesty International revealed the Riyadh authorities had claimed the detainees confessed on June 2 to communicating with Saudi Arabia’s enemies, and ‘providing financial and moral support to hostile elements abroad’.

Sophie Nash, who is 37 weeks pregnant , says she moved an empty tray in the fruit and veg aisle and almost vomited when she saw what was underneath.  She claims her clip shows a maggot crawling amongst what appears to be decomposing vegetable matter. The 23-year-old says she filmed the clip at Sainsbury\u0027s in Coldhams Lane, Cambridge, on Saturday. Sophie, from Haverhill, Suffolk, was searching for a fresher piece of broccoli when she moved a plastic tray, revealing the metal bin underneath.  She told Sainsbury\u0027s on social media: There was this absolutely disgusting sight. Sainsbury\u0027s customers should see this. Speaking today, Sophie said: I was just doing my normal shop and there was only a few pieces of broccoli left in the top crate so I lifted it up to see if there were anymore underneath as I wanted a fresher one. As I lifted it a lot of flies came out at me and when I looked down I saw maggots crawling around in this really smelly green gunk all over the bottom of the tray and the metal holder. I\u0027m currently 37 weeks pregnant too and I was absolutely disgusted by the sight, I honestly almost threw up.

This can be bad news for people with allergies, asthma and hayfever. The dry air can also dry out our skin, so it\u0027s important to keep moisturising.

But experts have advised people to turn off their fans tomorrow - because it\u0027s actually going to be TOO HOT. Yep, that\u0027s actually a thing. Using your fan tomorrow could terrifyingly actually make your room even hotter - if that\u0027s even possible.  According to the Government\u0027s heatwave plan , electric fans only work if it\u0027s less than 35C. This is because when it gets that hot fans just blow hot air directly on people, which makes them even hotter rather than cooling them down. Quoting research from the Cochrane Review, the plan states: Use of fans at temperatures above 35C fans may not prevent heat related illness. Additionally fans can cause excess dehydration). The advice is to place the fan at a certain distance from people, not aiming it directly on the body and to have regular drinks.  This is especially important in the case of sick people confined to bed. Temperatures are set to continue rising and the Met Office forecast states Friday could be the hottest day ever recorded in the UK. The all-time UK high is 38.5C which was set in August 2003. The Met Office has issued a warning for people to stay inside, check their elderly neighbours are coping with the heat, and keep windows closed during the day.

Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired. After that our attacking game was not there.“But I want a team who is ready for Dunfermline, that is ready for the league. We have the two weeks and we go now for the next level.”And Csaba was quick to point out United have not been the only team to have problems in these early season fixtures.“I have watched the results and every big team is struggling. You are not there where you want to be at the moment. This is not an excuse but it is true. If you train every week two times daily you see that legs are tired.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

according to a trade union.The GMB represents most of the hospital\u0027 security staff.It has calculated the sum on the number of hours that high-ranking, highly paid NHS officials have dedicated to the discussions.There have been nine meetings to date.Three more are scheduled to follow.The board has hit back, insisting that \"organisational change is managed within existing resources\".Such a reason is regularly given by public bodies when questioned about the use of staff time that is clearly beyond their regular, scheduled\u0026nbsp duties.The union has complained that morale among security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the security department was apparently prompted \"because an ex manager has the view that the guards don\u0026rsquot have enough work to do\".The GMB\u0027 regional officer Liz Gordon calculates that the process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of 22,000 steps per eight-hour shift \u0026ndash that\u0027 11 miles \u0026ndash and is often in crisis being reduced to single-man working.\"A spokeswoman for NHS Highland attempted to dismiss all the concerns.She said: \"Organisational change is managed within existing resources.\"Organisational change is ongoing in relation to security at Raigmore Hospital.\"The next meeting between management and union officials is scheduled for early August.Its aim, according to the board, is \"to allow those involved to bring together the work that\u0027 getting done in the background\".Scottish

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

It also called on people not to place stickers on lamps, benches or bridges.\"The padlocks cause rust and both stickers and padlocks damage paintwork,\" they said. \"All existing padlocks and stickers

is determined to edge out the Clarets in the Battle of Britain to ensure the Reds book a flight to Turkey to face Istanbul Basaksehir in the third qualifying round.Wright missed the draw for the second qualifying round as he was flying back from a holiday in the Middle East.When the Aberdonian touched down after an eight-hour journey he switched on his phone and the text pinged – the Reds had drawn Burnley.It may not be overseas but Wright accepts the tie against the English Premier League side is still high profile.And he is determined to land a blow for the reputation of Scottish football.He said: “Landing Burnley in Europe is a huge game and we aim to show Burnley and everyone what we can do.“We have competed in Europe over the last couple of years and are certainly not going to be slouches.“We will be right up for the game.“When the draw was made I was on a flight at the time back from a holiday in Dubai with my girlfriend.“When we landed I got a text saying we had drawn Burnley.“Obviously it is not overseas but it is an exciting tie – Europe always is.”Burnley were today set to arrive in the Granite City ahead of their first match in Europe for 51 years.The Clarets secured their Europa League spot courtesy of a seventh-placed finish in the English top flight that also brought £198 million in Premier League payments.Wright admits he is more used to seeing Burnley in action on Match of the Day on a Saturday night.However, the Clarets’ position in the richest league in the world, beamed to billions worldwide, will not faze Wright or his team-mates.He said: “You watch Burnley on Match of the Day every weekend but you have to put that to the side.“Ultimately it is just another game and Burnley are just another bunch of boys.“We are all going to be confident going into the tie and hopefully we can get a good result over both legs.”Although Dyche’s Clarets have the superior spending power the Dons have the edge in European experience.Aberdeen are set to embark on a fifth successive Europa League campaign under Derek McInnes while Burnley last played competitive continental football in the 1966-67 season.The Clarets have opted not to train at Pittodrie tonight ahead of the tie and did their work at Turf Moor this morning.“Burnley have to come to Pittodrie for the first game but I don’t think they will take us lightly,” said Wright.The Dons have exited the Europa League at the third qualifying round in each of the previous four seasons – to Apollon Limassol last year, Maribor (2016), Kairat Almaty (2015) and Real Sociedad (2014).The group stages and a basic payment in excess of £3m is the reward but the Reds will have to knock out Burnley to even replicate the level of previous seasons.Wright is relishing the challenge.He said: “It is a great time to be at Aberdeen.“These are exciting times as we have a couple of huge games against Burnley coming up.“There is also the game against Rangers to start the league so there is plenty to look forward to.“However, we just have to take it game by game and see where it takes us. That is all we can do.”Wright has played his way into contention to face Burnley tomorrow after an impressive pre-season. The winger was taken off in the 1-1 draw with West Brom after being kicked.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed Wright is fully fit and only took him off as a precautionary measure.Wright missed pre-season last year having sustained a hamstring injury during the Toulon Tournament in France while on international duty with the Scotland Under-20s.This summer he was again at the Toulon Tournament but returned fully fit after Scotland reached the semi-finals.He said: “All I can do is keep my head down in training, work hard and hopefully I will get the opportunity to show what I can do.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen skateboard company aims to create lasting legacy in doric","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDoric Skateboards hope to bring a sense of community to the skate scene in Aberdeen.The online retailer, which entered this year’s Evening Express Retailer Awards, hopes to scoop top spot in the Specialist Retailer category.Owner Gary Kemp launched Doric Skateboards in March 2017.Gary, who got his first skateboard when he was just eight years old, aims to create a skateboard brand the north-east can be proud of.He is heavily influenced by Aberdeen, its buildings and history.Gary – who also works for Optimus Aberdeen as project controls manager – said: “My inspiration comes from the city and everything I have soaked up over my life.“I was raised to have an interest in the history of Aberdeen and it has stuck with me.”The creative owner, who loves “interacting with customers and getting a new design kicked off”, would describe his business as “friendly, inclusive and determined”.To Gary, excellent customer service is all about “engagement, availability and being more than a standard set answer”.The businessman is a big fan of clean, symmetrically pleasing design.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"delighted scott reclaims toss title","story":"\t\tJoanne SimmsUpdated: 23/07/18, 12:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScott Rider is once again World Caber Champion, after he had to toss for it at Inveraray Games on Tuesday.The former Commonwealth Games shot-putter and Olympic four-man bobsleigh team member won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Judges at Winterton Park declared it was too close to call between the Englishman and Peter Bouma from Holland and it was down to a single toss of the caber each to decide the honour.The field of 10 was whittled down to a final five which also included Jamie Gunn, from Falkirk Lukasz Wenta, East Kilbride and Stuart Anderson, Lochearnhead.The event is sponsored by The George Hotel, Inveraray. Donald Clark from The George said: ‘It’s good on games’ day to see so many well-kent faces and to see new faces doing well in the games.’Once face missing from the games this year was the Duke himself he and his family are currently in India celebrating his 50th birthday.The honour of chieftain of the games was given to Rear Admiral John Weale OBE RASM, FOSNI, ACNS(SM) who heads the Royal Navy in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Amongst the guests this year was a contingent of members of the German branch of the Clan Campbell Society.More than 4,000 people attended the games the numbers held up well against other years and the visitors were rewarded with fine weather.They saw two records broken on the track this year: Jax Thoirs from Glasgow set a new open ground record for the long jump at 21 ft 7 inches and Aiden Quinn of Glasgow took the open hop, step and jump to 47ft 2½ inches.Numbers entering the solo piping contests were, like many other games, slightly down.

Six-year-old Saul Wylie has been told medics in the UK won’t treat his severe form of cerebral palsy. But \u0026pound80,000 will open the doors to pioneering treatment from the world’s top surgeon in America. Now a huge community effort is hoping to send Saul on his way to a better life. The brave twin – who was born weighing just 1lb – faces gruelling treatment and rehab which docs at home will not back. But parents Karen and Stuart have launched a ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign that they hope will put him on the plane. Karen, 39, said: “Saul has been a fighter from day one and wasn’t even supposed to be here. “We were told to terminate him in order to give his brother a better chance of survival, but that was never an option. “He then spent most of his first year in hospital because he was born so fragile. “He’s just used to things being against him.” Saul, of Tarbolton, suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy, where he sits at grade four on a scale of five. At present, doctors in this country will only treat children until stage three. But surgery in St Louis, Missouri is available that could give Saul a whole new lease of life. Karen revealed: “We feel guilty appealing for so much money, but the reality is that’s what it will take for this treatment. “Saul would face two operations to take away bad nerves and lengthen his legs – and the rehab would be long and intensive. “He has regressed so much in the last couple of years, as before he used to be able to stand with the aid of his walker. “It will only get worse and more painful unless he gets the help he needs.” Saul, who is looking forward to starting life at Tarbolton Primary next month, has already been backed by more than \u0026pound25,000 of fundraising. Dad Stuart said: “We’ve been blown away by the support so far. “Saul is very well known around the village and people have been so kind and eager to help. “We have a number of events planned and we just hope we can make this a reality.” To learn more about the campaign, visit https://www.justgiving/campaigns/charity/just4children/stepsforsaulLike us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsCerebral palsyCharity"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Thirty of the 32 Scottish local authorities have at least one Citizens Advice Scotland centre. But South Ayrshire is believed never to have had the help and rights championing service. Inverclyde is the only other area which does not have a CAB. Now a summit has been staged within Ayr County Buildings to state a case for having the service here. The steering group of councillors met on July 12 and one source said: “There is a definite anomaly here and the question should be asked why there is not a citizens advice bureau here. “I believe need has never been greater, with increasing consumer debt and other problems.” Councils have a duty to provide the advice, but South Ayrshire Council use their own staff to give it. They work out of the Wallace Tower in Ayr, but critics insist that because they are not independent, the advice cannot be of supreme impartiality. The source added: “Often people are coming in to say they cannot pay council tax or rent. “So far from being not involved, the Council is in fact the creditor. “A push is on to finally set up a proper service for the people of South Ayrshire. “There are a lot of odd things about the South Ayrshire model, not least who is informing it on a national basis. “It is a mystery why South Ayrshire Council should or can be operating an advice centre. “They are conflating advice with information.” Citizens Advice Scotland is a registered charity, helping 300,000 people a year from a total of 61 centres. It is often a place of last resort for people having difficulties in their lives, including being weighed down by debt. And the organisation also lobbies for change in government policy where it has identified hardship being caused. All local Citizens Advice Bureaux are managed by an independent board of directors and all bureaux are members of Citizen’s Advice Scotland.  A South Ayrshire Council spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting our communities  and our people, particularly those in need.  “Through our Information and Advice Hub we already provide services which deal with income maximisation, debt and money advice and consumer information.” The umbrella body Citizens Advice Scotland refused to comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr NewsTaxes"},{"url":null,"title":"distinguished-service-honour-for-walkerburn-academic","story":"A WALKERBURN academic has been honoured by his peers for distinguished service to education.\nDr Colin Russell retired from the chalkface five years ago.\nBut his continued input into improving education across the country was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Award by the British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society.\nDr Russell, who held several headships and teaching posts at schools across the Borders and Lothians, was chair of the Society from 2011 to 2013.\nAnd it was during their recent meeting at Beaumont Mansion in Windsor that Dr Russell received his award.\nHe told us: \"I am deeply honoured to have received the Distinguished Service Award.\"\nDr Russell\u0027s contribution to the British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society included his instrumental role in the founding of the International Congress of Educational Leadership Societies (ICELS) and the design and implementation of the Reflective Practice Award.\nLeading figures in the field spoke of his commitment and dedication during the dinner.\nEmeritus Professor Ron Glatter said: \"Dr Russell embodied the close interplay between reflective practice and research that is at the heart of BELMAS\u0026rsquos mission.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"amythyst-set-to-sparkle-in-selkirk","story":"IN case you missed Amythyst Kiah\u0027s previous two headline slots at the String Jam Club, you have the opportunity to make it third time lucky.\nDescribing herself as a Southern Gothic, alt-country blues singer/songwriter, Amythyst is one of the most incredible singers the musically-savvy County Hotel audience has ever heard.\nBased in Tennessee, her commanding stage presence is only matched by her raw and powerful vocals -

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

for money, a watchdog has warned.\nJust six in 10 water customers in England and Wales believe their charges are fair \u0026ndash a figure that has remained static for seven years, a report by the Consumer Council for Water (CCWater) said.\nIts latest annual Water Matters survey found that nine out of 10 customers are satisfied with their water and sewerage services, but said it was \u0026ldquono surprise that the sector was coming under increased scrutiny in light of negative perceptions about charges.\nThose customers who think charges are unfair are more likely to have made contact with their water company in the past 12 months, and are also less likely to recommend their water company or believe the company cares, the survey found.\nMike Keil, CCWater\u0026rsquos head of policy and research, said: \u0026ldquoCustomers\u0026rsquo perceptions of fairness and value for money have remained disappointingly static for seven years, and it\u0026rsquos no surprise that the water sector is now coming under increased scrutiny.\n\u0026ldquoJust this year, service interruptions caused by March\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoBeast from the East\u0026rsquo and the current spell of dry weather have led to frustration among customers.\n\u0026ldquoUnless water companies take action now, it\u0026rsquos unlikely that we will see a reversal of this trend anytime soon.\nOver the past seven years, customers\u0026rsquo views on the fairness of charges have improved for three companies \u0026ndash Welsh Water, South West Water and Wessex Water, according to the watchdog.\nBut it said the failure of the industry as a whole to address the long-term issue showed that \u0026ldquomore work needs to be done.\nMr Keil said: \u0026ldquoWhile all companies now offer social tariffs to customers in financial difficulty, we think that there is an opportunity for companies to do a lot more in this area, for example by expanding these schemes and contributing more towards them.\n\u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos clear is that every contact made is an opportunity for water companies to increase trust and change customer attitudes by providing a positive experience.\nWater UK chief executive Michael Roberts said: \u0026ldquoThanks to \u0026pound150 billion of investment by water companies since the 1990s, customer satisfaction with water and sewerage services remains very high.\n\u0026ldquoHowever, we fully recognise that there is still more to do on other issues. Average bills are currently around \u0026pound1 a day and have remained roughly the same for the last 20 years in real terms.\n\u0026ldquoWhile six out of 10 people see that as good value for money, we are determined to improve on that.\nCustomers can compare how their water company is performing by visiting www.ccwater.org.uk or the Discover Water website www.discoverwater.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Josie Clarke, Press Association Consumer Affairs Correspondent\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027f1b7ef19-3d47-4ce1-b5e2-e5a664013018\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Water companies urged to improve fairness and value for money\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week 9","story":"The eyes of the world were on these 12 young footballers and their coach, trapped in a cave in Thailand.Their predicament was life-threatening, but a rescue operation was in place.To the delight of everyone and against all the odds, as I write this, all 12 young boys and their coach have been brought to safety.They have been incredibly brave as they endured darkness, cold and hunger, trapped by the threat of rising water if the rains come.The weakest is their coach as he ensured the boys had what little food was available and took nothing for himself.Sadly one of the first divers to go in lost his own life in an attempt to save them, but his skill led the way forward for the rescue plan.I hope and pray that by the time you read this, that they are all home and ready to play football again.They will never forget the courage and the ingenuity of the international team effort to save them and I’m sure the only reward their brave rescuers will want is to know the boys are well.Evidently the boys will be invited to the final of the World Cup itself, and maybe they can dream that one day they might play in this famous tournament themselves.I hope the teams in the final will include England as I wish all my English friends a truly successful end to a brilliantly played World Cup.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"has summer snapped shut","story":"A light patter of rain at about 8.15pm on Tuesday evening heralded a modest downpour into Wednesday morning.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.  In past years, East Lothian has been the backdrop for films including The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg\u0027s The BFG. The county also been used as a filming location for several adverts and many TV series, including the popular show Outlander.  Dave Neilson produced the Aldi advert via his award-winning company Filming Scotland.  When asked if he would return to East Lothian to film in the future, he said: \"Absolutely, there are so many locations that fit into a lot of the creative briefs we get through.  \"Also its good facilities and close proximity to Edinburgh it makes it an easy option in term of logistics.  \"In addition, the council are great at jumping on film requests quickly and give a very personal service so again that goes a long way to making the film process smooth.\"  Councillor John McMillan, cabinet spokesperson for economic development and tourism, said: \"It is extremely beneficial for filming to take place in East Lothian as it helps put East Lothian on the map both in terms of attracting other film companies and for potential tourists seeing our beautiful county on screen.  \"Obviously, it also helps our economy by safeguarding jobs in the hospitality industry and local shops, which all help to service film crews and sometimes even big stars!  \"I\u0027m delighted to hear Dave\u0027s positive comments about filming here and it just shows that our film charter has created an efficient partnership-working atmosphere and that can only be a good thing for East Lothian.\"  Rosie Ellison, head of Film Edinburgh, the film office for Edinburgh, East Lothian and the Scottish Borders, said: \"East Lothian has long been a popular destination for filmmakers, with East Lothian Council working in partnership with the region\u0027s film office Film Edinburgh since the mid-1990s, together assuring a film-friendly response to over 400 productions, including feature films Mary Queen of Scots, Outlaw King, Under The Skin, The Railway Man, TV dramas Outlander and Case Histories, and adverts for Chinese water company Ganten and now Aldi.\"  The Aldi advert can be seen online at youtube/watch?v=zRyK6ped4Eg"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7711998.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dominic-raab-in-brussels-for-brexit-talks","story":"  The Brexit Secretary has promised to bring \u0026ldquoas much energy as I can to the talks with the European Union\u0026rsquos chief negotiator.

Its latest annual Water Matters survey found that nine out of 10 customers are satisfied with their water and sewerage services, but said it was \u0026ldquono surprise that the sector was coming under increased scrutiny in light of negative perceptions about charges.  Those customers who think charges are unfair are more likely to have made contact with their water company in the past 12 months, and are also less likely to recommend their water company or believe the company cares, the survey found.  Mike Keil, CCWater\u0026rsquos head of policy and research, said: \u0026ldquoCustomers\u0026rsquo perceptions of fairness and value for money have remained disappointingly static for seven years, and it\u0026rsquos no surprise that the water sector is now coming under increased scrutiny.  \u0026ldquoJust this year, service interruptions caused by March\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoBeast from the East\u0026rsquo and the current spell of dry weather have led to frustration among customers.  \u0026ldquoUnless water companies take action now, it\u0026rsquos unlikely that we will see a reversal of this trend anytime soon.  Over the past seven years, customers\u0026rsquo views on the fairness of charges have improved for three companies \u0026ndash Welsh Water, South West Water and Wessex Water, according to the watchdog.  But it said the failure of the industry as a whole to address the long-term issue showed that \u0026ldquomore work needs to be done.  Mr Keil said: \u0026ldquoWhile all companies now offer social tariffs to customers in financial difficulty, we think that there is an opportunity for companies to do a lot more in this area, for example by expanding these schemes and contributing more towards them.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos clear is that every contact made is an opportunity for water companies to increase trust and change customer attitudes by providing a positive experience.  Water UK chief executive Michael Roberts said: \u0026ldquoThanks to \u0026pound150 billion of investment by water companies since the 1990s, customer satisfaction with water and sewerage services remains very high.  \u0026ldquoHowever, we fully recognise that there is still more to do on other issues.

Such is the demand for Scots products, the Chinese even have their own names for Highland Games, strongman kilty party, baa baa pudding, haggis and malt whisky which they cryptically call Trail Fragrant Liqueur Lane. Now as the Chinese spending power grows, wealthy tourists are being offered bespoke tours which are aimed at boosting visitor numbers, as well as selling more to China.  Chinese visitor numbers to the UK are expected to rise by almost 50% - from 260,000 to 384,000 - over the next five years, VisitBritain predicts.  Scotland currently accounts for almost one fifth (17%) of all of those coming to the UK from the country.  VisitScotland says the rise in visitors from China is expected to be driven by the young adult traveller, saying \u0026ldquomillennials are seen as a growing target market.  New figures show how important Chinese tourists are becoming to the Scottish economy. Spending by Chinese tourists increased by 414% between 2007 and 2016, from \u0026pound7 million to \u0026pound36 million.  Over the same period the number of Chinese visitors to Scotland increased by 192% 41,000 visits were recorded in 2016.  Pernod Ricard is targeting the country\u0026rsquos younger generation and its expanding middle classes who have higher disposable incomes.  More than 750 Chinese tourists will land later this week for a four-day tour that will see them immerse themselves in all aspects of Scottish culture.  They will visit the most famous whisky region of Speyside where they will tour the Strathisla Distillery, the world-renowned Glenlivet Distillery which was the first licensed one in the area and then Aberlour.  The visitors will also be invited to don kilts and sashes at a Highland dinner where they will have the opportunity to taste some of the best Scotland has to offer. Other excursions will include a trip to Loch Ness to try to spot the famous monster and no trip to Scotland would be complete without a visit to a football match and the group will take part in a tournament at Inverness Caledonian Thistle\u0026rsquos stadium.  The trip is part of a drive to improve sales in the vast Communist state with the country representing more than half of the global whisky trade with 25 bottles of Scotch exported to China every minute.  Neil MacDonald, Brand Experience Director, Chivas Brothers, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to be able to host our colleagues from China and show them all the wonderful sights and industries we have to offer here in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoVisiting the birthplace of our brands and becoming immersed in their craftsmanship and heritage really is the best way to understand what makes each of them unique.  \u0026ldquoThe experiences that our Chinese colleagues have in Scotland, the people they meet, the Scottish celebrations and being at our distilleries will fuel their personal story-telling to colleagues, consumers and trade back in China.  \u0026ldquoThis creates even stronger opportunities for our brands and Scotch whisky as a whole.  \u0026ldquoChina is a very important market for us, and we expect its significance will only continue to grow over the coming years.  \u0026ldquoBy fostering even stronger ties with our colleagues, we\u0026rsquore confident this trip will help us build on our solid partnership for the future.  It comes as the number of visitors travelling to the UK from China is expected to soar from fewer than 500 in 1996 to almost 500,000 by 2026, a report from VisitBritain states.  Chinese tourists spent more than \u0026pound513 million in the UK last year, but the figure is set to rise sharply.  Visits abroad have more than doubled in five years, from about 41 million overnight stays in 2011 to 85 million by 2016. By 2020 it is forecast to exceed 110 million trips overseas, In Scotland, visitor numbers have been boosted by the popularity of whisky, which has resulted in a surge of visits to distilleries.  The number of visitors to Scotland\u0026rsquos distilleries reached an all-time high of 1.7 million in 2016, an increase of 8% on the previous year, and the Scotch Whisky Association recognises the Chinese influx played a part in this increase.  Research shows the average age of Chinese visitors to the UK is younger than the average age of inbound travellers.  In 2016, half of Chinese visitors were aged 25-44 and it is estimated that 60% were aged 18 to 34.  Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness are known to be the favourite locations in Scotland for Chinese travellers to visit.  A growing number of Chinese have an estimated \u0026pound20million or more in liquid financial assets who are below the age of 30.  Whisky sales in China leapt in 2017 with imports of 17.4 million litres, representing a year-on-year growth of 19.5%.  Whisky is the third most popular alcoholic drink among Chinese people, with consumption growing more than 83% over the past five years."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2275658.jpg?type=article-full","title":"estate-agents-latest-casualties-on-the-high-street","story":"  But just as those businesses have slowly retreated from formerly vibrant town centres, it now appears that estate agents are following suit.  New research has found that failures among property businesses are on the rise in the UK, with more than 50 going bust each year in Scotland since 2013.  Across the border the situation is even worse, with 2,446 estate agents in England and Wales closing their doors during the same time frame as they come under pressure from rising costs and competition from the internet, according to research by property management firm DJ Alexander.  And it may be that office-based estate agents are going for good, with researchers finding \"generational\" shift in the way people look for property.    David Alexander, managing director of DJ Alexander Ltd, explained: \"For most people under 40-years-old, the idea of wandering from shop to shop in city centres\u0026rsquo is alien to them and they conduct many of their purchases on their phones, tablets, or computers.  \"This situation is only likely to continue, and we can see that High Street outlets such as estate agents are suffering as a result and will continue to suffer over the next few years.  \"Online competition has had a dramatic impact on the High Street with its lower cost base and its generational and cultural shift from on street to online shopping.  \"The internet has undercut much of the High Street in the retail and other sectors over the last five years and this is likely to continue.  The research covers a period when exclusively online estate agents such as Purple Bricks became established, proving that the model does work.    By cutting out bricks-and-mortar premises and handling everything electronically, firms such have these have been able to cut costs while serving clients needs, Mr Alexander said.  He added: \"The loss of the High Street estate agent does not mean less service, in fact it means more, with a greater focus on the needs of the client.  \"The online client is simply using a different method of accessing the housing market, but their demands remain as high, if not higher, than before.  \"But the market remains buoyant for those offering clients an up to date online service fully catering for all their needs from initial advice, consulting, managing, advertising, and promoting with their key legal and financial needs met.  \"It is a brave new world but one in which estate agency will continue to exist but not in the way it has in the past and these failures are a sign that there will be closures along the way as the market adjusts.  Gavin Mochan, Sales Director for s1Homes, said that the rise of online estate agents had gathered pace in recent years.  He said: \"Initially, when online portals came to pass the pure online agent seemed inconceivable given some of the key ingredients were missing.  \"A great example of a missing fundamental was data. Back then finding out how much your house was worth was reliant on the local knowledge of your estate agent and the process was purely physical.  \"These days portals such as s1homes can tell you the purchase price of every house in the street giving you very credible estimates.\"  However, he said that the estate agents who are doing best are those who have developed a hybrid approach using both an online and a physical presence.  Andrew Perratt, Head of Residential Property at Savills in Scotland agrees, saying that even with their wide-reaching work on the web, there is little substitute for a face-to-face meeting.    He said: \"Savills is currently seeing the strongest market in Scotland for a decade and having a powerful website with global reach is more important than ever.  \"That said, it is ultimately about listening to our clients and our research tells us that they continue to want the convenience of their agent on the high street.  \"The most successful agents are combining the benefits of powerful online marketing with a first class personalised service from people they can actually meet face to face.  He added: \"You can\u0026rsquot do that by hiding behind a pc. As long as consumers want the convenience of speaking to a local agent with in depth local market knowledge, we\u0026rsquoll continue to offer a branch network which puts our agents at the heart of their local communities.\"  Malcolm Leslie, Head of Residential Agency for Strutt \u0026amp Parker in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThere is no doubt that businesses across every sector need to adapt to a changing marketplace and find ways of responding to new challenges.  \"The residential property sector has recently been going through a visible period of disruption and change, with the \u0026lsquoonline\u0026rsquo agency models reaching the headlines, and \u0026lsquoproptech\u0026rsquo companies appearing at a rapid pace.  \"To ensure we stay in touch with our clients\u0026rsquo needs and expectations, we are responding and adapting to those challenges through the use of that technology.\"  He added:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe think there is a place in the future \u0026nbspfor both online\u0026nbspagents and traditional agents.  \"There will be sellers who choose to market their properties online, which realistically allows vendors to sell their home themselves, and those who are willing to pay for a complete service, with the additional hope that having a dedicated expert will result in a better sale and higher price."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-criticised-for-defending-partys-role-in-bringing-thatcher-to-power","story":"  Tommy Sheppard, the SNP\u0026rsquos Cabinet Office spokesman, told a Westminster debate: \u0026ldquoIn retrospect, I would have done exactly the same thing.

Party insiders are keen to draw a line under the controversy for fear it might drag on and overshadow Labour\u0026rsquos autumn conference in September.  Ms Griffith told the BBC: \u0026ldquoThe idea that Jeremy would want to set up an atmosphere in the party where people couldn\u0026rsquot go and say things to him is completely absurd.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos just not his way of dealing things. We\u0026rsquod all prefer to have somebody speak to your face rather than behind your back. It\u0026rsquos important that we have those discussions and if it means we need to do a lot more work to get things right let\u0026rsquos do it.  The Llanelli MP said at the moment she was not aware of any processes \u0026ldquoby which, because somebody speaks to somebody else \u0026lsquoin a particular way\u0026rsquo we\u0026rsquove had disciplinary procedures. Normally if we\u0026rsquore speaking about policy, if we\u0026rsquore talking about issues, we can have those discussions.  She added: \"I just can\u0026rsquot see a situation where we discipline people for speaking their minds to each other, whether its members of the Shadow Cabinet or the Leader of the Opposition himself.\"  Mr McDonnell blamed Dame Margaret\u0026rsquos \"haranguing\" of the party leader on her \"complete misunderstanding\" of the party\u0027s new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which has been widely criticised within the Jewish community.  Dame Margaret - who is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust - has said she stands by her comments, though she denies swearing at Mr Corbyn in an angry confrontation in a Commons corridor last week.  Jennie Formby, Labour\u0026rsquos General Secretary, has written to the backbencher, telling her she faced investigation for \"abusive conduct\" and that \"any further behaviour of a similar nature\" could result in disciplinary action.  Mr McDonnell pointed out how Dame Margaret\u0027s outburst was \"out of character\" and she was \"extremely angry and lost her cool\" when she confronted Mr Corbyn.  \"Of course, he was upset Margaret was upset as well,\" he explained. \u0026ldquoJeremy was deeply upset because, when you have someone haranguing you in that way, of course it\u0027s upsetting. Those sorts of accusations, when he has worked so hard on the issues of anti-Semitism and anti-racism, of course he\u0027s upset.\"  The Shadow Chancellor said later interviews had shown Dame Margaret\u0027s concern had been based on a misunderstanding of the code agreed by Labour\u0027s ruling National Executive Committee.  \"I realised there was a complete misinterpretation of the code, so I can understand why she was so angry if that\u0027s what she believed this code had done. It\u0027s a complete misunderstanding and we can resolve this amicably and move on.\"  Mr McDonnell said Mr Corbyn agreed that the case should be settled swiftly rather than subjected to the full disciplinary process.  \"At the weekend I spoke to Jeremy and said we\u0027ve got to resolve this matter quickly,\" explained the London MP. \"He said, yes, we\u0027ve got to do that, and he\u0027s asked the Chief Whip and General Secretary to try to sort this out. We want it resolved amicably and that can be done.\"  He stressed that neither he nor Mr Corbyn could get involved in the disciplinary process overseen by Ms Formby and Nick Brown, the Chief Whip.  And he said he did not know who had initially reported Dame Margaret\u0027s behaviour, saying only that \"a range of complaints came in\".  On Monday, Labour MPs agreed to stage a vote in September on whether to accept the new code, which has come under fire because its list of anti-Semitic behaviours omits a number of examples included by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.  The party insists that the examples, mostly relating to criticism of the state of Israel, are dealt with elsewhere in the document.  Mr McDonnell said it would be \"mistaken\" to think that Mr Corbyn\u0027s long association with pro-Palestinian campaigns should raise questions about his commitment to fighting anti-Semitism.  After initially stumbling over his words and describing Labour as \"a party that is anti-racist and anti-Semitist\", he told the BBC\u0026rsquos Today programme: \"We are against anti-Semitism, we are a party that attacks anti-Semitism wherever it is, either in our party or in our community.  \"We are going to tackle this and we will lead that campaign to ensure that Jewish people are respected and feel safe within our community.  \"Jeremy is as committed to that as anyone else within our party and anyone else within our community,\" he added."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8118515.jpg?type=article-full","title":"diver-finds-britains-largest-gold-nugget-in-scotland","story":"  A treasure hunter has uncovered the largest nugget ever discovered in Britain while diving in a Scottish river.

Experts say it is 500 years since a similar nugget has been found in Britain - although there may be more where this one came from.  However, the location of the river is being kept under wraps to prevent a disorderly gold rush.    The man, who has been hunting for gold as a hobby for 20 years, said: \u0026ldquoI was following a crack in the bedrock and found around 2g in fine gold.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThis then led to a pocket, where I uncovered the nugget.

Historically, it is off the Richter scale.

He said: \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to say whether this nugget broke from a larger chunk or not.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThe rounded edges of the piece indicate that it has certainly been in the watercourse for a while.  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far, though.

This compares to 186 last year, 159 the year before and 128 in 2015.  Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council of Scotland (GTCS), said applications were \u0026ldquofalling off a cliff and placed the blame firmly with Brexit.  He told Holyrood magazine: \"Having maintained numbers pretty high from the EU, they are falling off a cliff, and that\u0027s absolutely down to Brexit.  \"Particularly from three countries in the EU, Greece, Poland and Spain, we get a good number of applicants, followed by the Republic of Ireland it has to be said \u0026ndash those four are our big hitters, and those numbers have dwindled to next to nothing.\"  The overall number of applicants from outside Scotland has also plummeted, with only 126 in the first half of 2018 \u0026ndash compared to 598 last year and 614 the year before.  A spokeswoman for the EIS \u0026ndash Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest teaching union \u0026ndash insisted teachers from other countries \u0026ldquoare a valuable part of the Scottish education workforce, reflecting the society we live in.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis reported drop in applications can only exacerbate the ongoing teacher recruitment crisis.  Research by the Herald last summer showed there were more than 700 unfilled teacher vacancies before the start of term, with the shortfall blamed on a rise in numbers quitting the profession early and historic under-recruitment.  And earlier this year it emerged a teaching post in the north of Scotland had\u0026nbspbeen advertised six times by desperate council bosses \u0026ndash attracting just two applicants.  The latest figures came as teaching unions threatened to strike later this year amid an ongoing dispute over pay.  Scottish ministers said\u0026nbspthe dramatic drop in EU teachers demonstrated the urgent need for migration powers to be devolved, allowing Scotland to tailor policies to its needs.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \u0026ldquoThese figures show the stark reality of Brexit. Already highly-skilled and hard-working EU citizens are thinking twice about choosing to live and teach in Scotland which will not only have a negative impact on the education workforce but our economy and society as a whole.  \u0026ldquoLast year we had citizens from almost every EU member country applying for GTCS registration but, so far this year, citizens from just six countries have applied to live and work in Scotland. And the head of the GTCS \u0026ndash the independent body that registers teachers \u0026ndash has today made plain that Brexit is driving this slump.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos education spokesman Iain Gray branded the figures \u0026ldquodeeply worrying.  He said teacher numbers had already plummeted under the SNP Government, and referenced a survey published last month which found a majority of teachers would not recommend the profession to others.  He added: \u0026ldquoA collapse in the number of applications from abroad as a result of the Tories\u0026rsquo shambolic handling of Brexit will only make this SNP teacher recruitment crisis worse.  Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo education spokesman, said teachers are \u0026ldquooverworked and under-resourced, adding: \u0026ldquoThis is yet another way in which Brexit, which Scotland overwhelmingly rejected, is already damaging our society.

In an interview with 5 News, Mrs May did not deny stockpiling was happening and insisted the Government was being \"responsible and sensible\" while still trying to get a good deal with Brussels.  Her comments came as Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, on a visit to Belfast, also insisted no-deal contingency planning was a \u0026ldquosensible and responsible thing for a government to do and large businesses that are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans.  He added: \u0026ldquoAnd we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.\"  Earlier this week, Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, told MPs he had asked officials to \"work up options for stockpiling\" by the pharmaceutical industry while his Cabinet colleague Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, said the Government would also take steps to ensure an \"adequate food supply\".  The PM said: \"Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but...because we don\u0027t know what the outcome is going to be... let\u0027s prepare for every eventuality.  \"This is not just about stockpiling. That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.\"  Her comments came as a new poll suggested trust in her ability to handle Brexit was falling quickly.  An ICM poll for  found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 General Election.  On the parties\u0026rsquo standing, it put Labour on 41 per cent, up two points from a fortnight ago, Tories down one point on 40 per cent, with Lib Dems on eight points, Ukip on five and the Greens on three.  Earlier, Mr Coveney made clear Dublin would back any request from the UK for an extension to the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate its withdrawal from the EU.  While he said there was still time to reach agreement by October, he called for an \"intensification\" of the talks at official level over the summer to resolve outstanding differences.  The Irish minister warned that certain elements of the UK negotiating position as set out in the UK Government\u0026rsquos Brexit White Paper would be difficult for Brussels to agree to although he noted that the document had made negotiations \"easier\" by backing away from earlier red lines.  Mr Coveney dismissed suggestions that amendments to the Brexit legislation had forced on the PM by Eurosceptic backbenchers would prevent agreement on a \"backstop\" arrangement for the Northern Irish border.  His remarks came ahead of a meeting on Thursday between Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, and Mrs May\u0026rsquos trip to Salzburg on Friday for talks with her Austrian counterpart.  On Tuesday, the PM confirmed that as the Brexit talks entered their final weeks she was taking personal charge of them with Mr Raab \"deputising\" for her in Brussels.  Tory Eurosceptics voiced concerns that the Brexit Department had been \u0026ldquosidelined by No 10 and Mrs May\u0027s Europe chief adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that divisions within the Conservative camp could result in a no-deal Brexit.  In a separate development, Lord Trimble, the former First Minister of Northern Ireland, warned that any attempt by the Irish Government to impose post-Brexit tariffs on trade with the UK would lead to an upsurge in smuggling at the Irish border.  The Conservative peer said an increase in smuggling would have the \"delightful\" side-effect of diverting criminal elements away from paramilitary activity by giving them something more useful to do.  But he said the better solution would be the removal or reduction of tariffs across the whole British Isles.  The former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party called on Dublin to press Brussels for a British Isles exemption from the requirement to collect tariffs on trade with countries outside the EU.  \"It\u0027s in its own interests for them to speak to the EU about tariffs and about the reduction or elimination of tariffs within the British Isles.  \"That would be a huge step forward for everyone and it would solve all the other problems, including the problems that have been manufactured by people over the course of the last year or so,\" added Lord Trimble."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-pledges-post-brexit-farming-industry-fit-for-the-future","story":"  The Prime Minister will set out the UK Government\u0027s plans for a post-Brexit farming policy, explaining how the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy subsidy system based on land farmed will be replaced with a system of public money for public goods.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me.

I feel like a part of the community here. People bring me stuff all the time \u0026ndash recently I was given a bag of clothes \u0026ndash not all of them fitted me, so I took the rest to a charity shop so they could use them. And recently one of my customers bought me lunch.\"The staff at Tesco always ask how I\u0026rsquom doing \u0026ndash I get on really well with Steve, the manager, he tells me I\u0026rsquom good with the punters.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years. It\u0026rsquos the town\u0026rsquos harbour and while its use has changed over the last few years, it\u0026rsquos still very important.\"It\u0026rsquos of historical significance.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaThursday 26 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773314.1532458728!/image/image.jpg","title":"ayesha hazarika on brexit tories tell lies and corbyn sells unicorns","story":"        The Tories are telling lies while Corbyn has a bridge with unicorns to sell you, writes Ayesha Hazarika                Westminster is smoking hot. And not in a good way. This kind of heatwave is no laughing matter. Having been brought up in Glasgow, I am not equipped to deal with this.             I know my parents are Indian, but they came here to escape this kind of godawful evil weather. Cats and dogs are begging to be shaved it’s so bad. And the heat has clearly affected British politics because it has gone into meltdown.            MPs head off for their summer break this week and some of us would normally say it was “well deserved”, but they haven’t covered themselves in glory and leave behind what can be only be described as a genuine political crisis.Brexit has trapped us in a what Danny Dyer brilliantly described as a mad political riddle where the business of running the country has effectively ground to the halt. Although to be fair that hasn’t just happened this parliamentary term. Government ministers, advisers and the civil service haven’t had the bandwidth to focus on the rather difficult day job of running the country since David Cameron called the EU referendum because the toxic politics of the campaign took over. Ironically for a campaign which was dominated by the slogan “take back control”, domestic British politics has spun out of control. We have huge problems the length and breadth of these shores which need the best brains, focus, hard-work, determination and good faith – from funding gaps in the NHS to the lack of opportunities for young people to housing and infrastructure – and sadly our most of our leading politicians seem to be woefully lacking all these qualities.The Conservatives are the equivalent of a circular firing squad and are so busy fighting over Brexit and jostling for who will succeed Theresa May, who will be out the door faster than you can say “strong and stable” once some deal is done on Brexit – although, her words “no deal is better than a bad deal” are proving to be rather prophetic. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White Paper            A ‘no deal’ and crashing out of the EU on WTO terms is now a growing prospect. If this happens, it won’t be because the EU won’t accept a deal, it will be because hard-right Tory Brexiteers won’t. After Chequers, she sent Ministers out on the airwaves to say that this was the absolute, final Cabinet position, then the very next day she gave in to Jacob Rees-Mogg. With this kind of the steel, I bet the EU are sh****** themselves. She then conceded that she would have to probably give way to the EU on further areas, which is true but how do you think the hard-right in her party are going to take those concessions? They are emboldened, and they will not give way. They never have. Ever since the days of John Major, who was out over the weekend calling for a second referendum.I am much more sympathetic to this notion now, but it won’t magic away all the problems – it would simply unblock the Brexit impasse we have in Parliament. What would the question or indeed questions be? How many options would have you have? Would you even include the option to overturn the decision and remain in the EU or would that be seen as undemocratic and unfair? And remainers like me might get a nasty shock – a second referendum may deliver an even bigger margin for leave because, if people hated Westminster in the run-up to the referendum, you can bet your bottom dollar they would want to give it an even bigger two-fingers after two years of arsing around.But it may be the only option if politics can’t find a way though. To give you an idea of how messed up the Government’s Brexit plans are, yesterday it was announced that the Brexit Department will no longer be negotiating Brexit. You literally could not make this stuff up.READ MORE: Food safety controls under threat from no-deal Brexit            Speaking of which, a special mention must go to Vince Cable, leader of the Lib Dems who last week managed to miss a critical vote on Brexit because he was allegedly at a dinner discussing setting up a new party to stop Brexit. Former leader Tim Farron also missed this important vote because he was busy making a speech about homosexuality and the church. It’s great to see the political titan whose only contributions to the last general election was the phrase “smell my spaniel” and a massive row about gay sex is back out there on his “it’s a sin” tour.But things took a more sinister twist when the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, was swindled out of her vote at a knife-edge moment because the Tories basically lied to her. She has just had a baby and is still on maternity leave. Julian Smith, the Tory Chief Whip, promised she would be “paired” with MP Brandon Lewis during a crucial Brexit vote. This is an arrangement where if an MP is sick or they can’t be in parliament for an important vote, their “pair” from the opposing party agrees not to vote so that they cancel each other out. It’s based on trust and honour ... Lewis then broke that promise and voted. This is outrageous. The Tories are saying this was an innocent mistake. Do me a favour. We weren’t born yesterday like Swinson’s baby! Lewis and Smith clearly lied, and should be sacked. It’s polite to give up your seat for a pregnant woman – they should be made to give up theirs. Permanently. What a low moment for politics.And don’t look to Labour for any comfort on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn showed his true Eurosceptic heart by making a speech where he tried to sell us the economic “benefits” of Brexit, which got praised to the rafters by the Leave campaign. He also has a massive bridge to sell you, with a unicorn waiting for each and every one of you on the other side. So, the chances of Labour blocking Brexit or backing a second referendum or a ‘people’s vote’ are pretty slim. Mind you. They have bigger fish to fry right now. Like picking the mother of all rows with the Jewish community over anti-semitism and trying to make communism fashionable again.I really do despair. Never have we needed better politics.

I have long considered myself an avid radio listener. It is a habit ingrained by weekend afternoons in my grandfather’s kitchen, where after a daunder back from the bookies, we would gather round the wireless and listen intently to proceedings from Ascot or Newmarket, where the rising pitch of the commentators vied for attention with the rush of hooves and the desperate, hopeful shouts of the crowd.            I should probably count myself lucky that I never developed an affinity for the gee-gees as a consequence, but I will always be grateful for that early introduction to a medium that felt more immediate than television ever could.            Growing up with one foot in the analogue age, I kept the flame burning, and with the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital radio stations, my habit became hopelessly and permanently entrenched. I have lost count of sleepless hours given over to Ira Glass and John Hockenberry on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation, discussing obscure issues in a distant country in a way that felt relevant and intimate.Glass, of course, went on to create This American Life, a radio show which morphed into one of the world’s most popular podcasts. Even today, each episode is downloaded by around 2.5 million people. If that particular show’s success is well established, it would appear the popularity of its medium has yet to peak. The latest analysis by Rajar, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, shows that as of this spring, some six million adults across Britain listened to at least one podcast a week.That number might appear relatively small – just 11 per cent of the population – but when you assess it the proper context, its scale – and growth – is really quite something. Only last year, the number stood at just 4.7 million, and the number of people now downloading podcasts now outstrips the reach of BBC Radio 5 Live. READ MORE: From football to knitting: the rise of the Scottish podcast            Such statistics have led to 2018 being hailed by the BBC as the year of the “podcast boom”. Such a bold prophecy may be intended as self-fulfilling, at least on the BBC’s part. In March, the corporation announced the appointment of its first-ever podcast commissioner, Jason Phipps, and it clearly believes it can build on the 240 million annual downloads of its programmes. It, along with other broadcasters and media companies, faces a stern challenge in attracting a younger demographic who do not consume their media via linear channels, and podcasting is one the most obvious areas to focus on. Recent research by Acast, one of the main competitors to iTunes as the world’s leading podcast platform, found that two thirds of listeners are aged between 16 and 34. What is more, nearly a fifth of them have only started listening in the past six months. The success of the BBC’s evolving podcasting operation alone will not solve that problem, but it is a start.            It is hard, however, to see the projected ‘boom’ coming to pass. Podcasting is hardly a new, emerging medium. In one form or another, it has been a staple of our media diet for well over a decade. iTunes first started collating a directory of podcasts as far back as 2005, when the term was named as the Merriam Webster dictionary’s word of the year. Within the space of 12 months, the comedian, Ricky Gervais, helped propel the medium into the public consciousness, with millions of users downloading his comedy shows.  For a good few years, the podcast charts were dominated by such high-profile figures looking to emulate Gervais’s success. And while the podcasting world is still inhabited by any number of celebrities, its greatest treasures are to be found elsewhere. READ MORE: Podcast tells gory tale of Scottish crime writer’s lifeIn the past few days, I have listened to a 50-minute documentary about the economics of US dentistry, an hour-long interview with Kenney Jones, the former drummer with the Small Faces, and a two hour-long show devoted entirely to the 1978 arcade game, Space Invaders.Slowly but surely, such esoteric listening choices have displaced live radio as my audio go-to. I subscribe to more than 70 different shows, and on an average week, I will listen to around 12 hours of programming. Over the past year, the lion’s share of this has consisted of podcasts which focus on US politics, such as FiveThirtyEight, Pod Save America, Trumpcast, Trump Inc, all of which provide incisive takes on the Trump administration.            But so too, my podcast diet is supplemented by an ever-widening spectrum of programmes that embrace niche subjects. On the one hand, it includes the likes of Trade Talks, a weekly insight into international trade deals, and The Tip Off, which interviews leading journalists about how they came across some of their biggest stories. On the other hand, it takes in Wrestle Me, where comedians Marc Haynes and Pete Donaldson revisit every WrestleMania event from 1985 onwards in chronological order, and Cult of Geshcast, in which two Glaswegian friends, Gavin Spence and Phillip Maddison, discuss various cults and sects through the ages. These are my niche interests, but whatever you are interested in, or even curious about, chances are there is a podcast out there for you. There might not be a boom in 2018, but with the bewildering choice of programmes out there, it’s hard to see how podcasts will fail to become an increasingly prominent part of our media landscape."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773720.1532526154!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish mps brand royal navy frigate delay utterly shocking","story":"        Five new Royal Navy frigates expected to begin operation in 2023 risk being delayed after the Ministry of Defence admitted it had received no viable bids to build them.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nThursday 26 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH1307NCA.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

SinnFéin believes they should be central to the fabric of a new Ireland.\n\nNelson knows that is our position.\nA false, negative narrative, or ‘project fear’ is being fuelled by some seniorunionists and Orange leaders.\nThey choose to reduce the Good Friday Agreement, the rights and equalityagenda, anti-sectarianism, and reconciliation as zero sum concepts.\nEquality and respect are promoted as losses for unionists, instead of wins foreveryone.\nCampaigning for Irish Language rights is maliciously distorted as culturalwarfare, rather than parity of esteem.\nThe most recent example is the smokescreen created around the DUP leadership’sdecision to renege on the advanced agreement with Sinn Féin on 14thFebruary.\nThis false narrative exposes the failure of political unionist and Orangeleadership.\nThe only possible outcome is to encourage fear and mistrust, and deepenpolarisation.\nThe cheer leaders for ‘project fear’ within unionism are notserious about a shared future.\nThey seek to politically and electorally profit from sectarian division.\nMutual respect and parity of esteem apply equally to our sharedOrange and Gaelic cultures, unionist and Republican traditions, and British andIrish identities.\nThepolitical process is broken.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out. We will get back to everyone as soon as we have strength.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8579397.1532525784!/image/image.jpg","title":"estate agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8572863.1531997113!/image/image.jpg","title":"lockhart hails donaghcloney success","story":"\nDUP MLA Carla Lockhart has congratulated Lower Iveagh West Orange District on a successful Twelfth July week and parade. \n\n                \nThis year Donaghcloney hosted the demonstration and large crowds flocked to the town.

I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail. We had a real effort this year by the committee and residents of the village to ensure this was a week long festival and were treated to features for people of all ages with the Songs of Praise, A Drummers Tribute, a night of remembrance, the community fun night and then the Twelfth July celebrations. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“A great turnout of Orangemen and women, bandsmen, Lambeg drums and spectators with plenty of variety for children of all ages in the demonstration field.
