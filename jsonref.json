The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

Tomorrow she will attend her first official engagement as a royal, at a Buckingham Palace garden party to mark Charles\u0027s 70th birthday.Meghan has, sources say, already become a strong influence on the direction of Harry\u0027s public work, particularly his championing of women\u0027s issues.The couple plan to become \u0027Commonwealth champions\u0027, to the delight of the Queen. A trip to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October is being discussed at the highest level and aides are promising that the second half of this year will be \u0027incredibly busy\u0027 for the pair.They will also take a couple of short trips before the summer, including a visit to Dublin. Harry, 33, is yet to visit Ireland but Meghan, 36, spent time there as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014.But it is the visit to Australia, where Harry\u0027s Invictus Games for injured servicemen and women is being held in Sydney, that is expected to showcase the duke and duchess as a new royal \u0027power couple\u0027 Yesterday, a senior aide said everyone, not least the bride and groom, had been deeply moved by how well Saturday\u0027s wedding went. \u0027I think that although the day was unquestionably royal in every way  it felt like just the two of them were there,\u0027 said another. \u0027When they looked into each other\u0027s eyes it was clear nothing else mattered.\u0027 Saturday evening\u0027s riotous party was described as the \u0027perfect end to a perfect day\u0027. Meghan gave a speech in which she grinned broadly as she referred to Harry as \u0027my husband\u0027. \u0027I think he was even more emotional than her,\u0027 a source said.\u0027Meghan also expressed her gratitude to her mother and to her friends  but the person she really singled out was the Prince of Wales. She has been so touched by how welcoming he has been to her and her mother.\u0027 The couple spent their first night of married life in Windsor Castle\u0027s Lancaster Tower, before enjoying a night at a mystery location. But they will return to work this week, having postponed their honeymoon.

You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/18/4C726F3F00000578-5753943-Unlike_other_newlyweds_Harry_and_Meghan_will_not_be_jetting_off_-a-2_1526922764522.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan return Kensington Palace just two days royal wedding","story":"Keep it chic like Meghan in shades by Ray-BanGet them at NET-A-PORTERMeghan Markle is bringing her own very brand of style to the Royal Family, and we can\u0026#39t wait to see what she\u0026#39ll wear in her first few weeks as the new Duchess of Sussex.

The actress turned him downBut the sexy actress, horrified by the notion of sleeping with a \u0027puerile warmonger\u0027 after the fated Bay of Pigs invasion, turned down the request.Madame Claude did not disappoint her clients and went beyond his wildest sex dreams. She had the perfect girl.\u0027JFK\u0027s blind date was a very Jackie-like sylph who was employed as a fitting model for Givenchy himself,\u0027 - Givenchy being Jackie\u0027s favorite couturier - the book states. Madame Claude had this 23-year old Sorbonne grad wear the exact same white Givenchy dress that Jackie was going to be wearing at the ball at Versailles that very night.She was \u0027Jackie le deuxième\u0027 – Jackie the second. \u0027She looked like Cinderella on her way to the ball. But the only ball she would be attending was the imminent one in her simple bedroom,\u0027 Stadiem writes. JFK was alone with this \u0027swan\u0027 for one half hour before having to return to his hotel to prepare for the evening\u0027s festivities, the highlight of the trip.          William Stadiem\u0027s Madame Claude reveals details of the brothel-keeper\u0027s secret world The madame later learned that the president wanted her to replicate his wife in an \u0027erotic dimension\u0027 because the couple hadn\u0027t been sleeping together.  JFK had even complained to the model that his wife was more interested in fashion than sex.So the swan gave him a striptease and illustrated for him that the two were not mutually exclusive. At Versailles that night, JFK profusely complimented his wife and told everyone in his entourage how fabulous she looked – all the while thinking of his swan.In 1961, the madame\u0027s rates for an hour with a Claudette would have cost a Frenchman $50. However, the cost of this perfectly executed and discreet Madame Claude experience was going be ten times the going rate for the president.\u0027This was an affair of state...and her price for her services to the American president was two thousand dollars,\u0027 the book states. Although the French claimed they had no interest in affairs of domestic or foreign leaders, they did indeed know where JFK was every minute he was in France.The state apartments at Quai d\u0027Orsay – where the Kennedys were staying – \u0027had a thousand ears and eyes. \u0027And there was no such thing as too much secret information\u0027.Impressed by her discreet handling of this encounter, Madame Claude was soon enlisted by the Elysée Palace and the French equivalent of the CIA and French FBI, to provide them with pillow talk and what went on between the sheets.          The president\u0027s press secretary Pierre Salinger (left)  was the enabler who arranged the liaison with Madame after getting her phone number from Frank Sinatra\u0027s valet Rarely appearing in public, she became the most famous unseen woman in France, Madame de la République.Her principal protector was top cop and all-powerful Paris police chief, Maurice Papon, a well-known Nazi collaborator.In fact, French president George Pompidou also protected Claude and used her for espionage.Dr. Max Jacobson was the president\u0027s cover on that trip and Pierre Salinger, Kennedy\u0027s press secretary and future California senator, was the enabler who arranged the liaison with Madame after getting her phone number from Frank Sinatra\u0027s valet.To be discreet, he used code language as if he was buying a gift saddle for Jackie\u0027s horse from Hermes.JFK later requested a second visit by Jackie le deuxième in Washington. But when she wasn\u0027t available for the rendezvous, the ever-creative Claude found an acceptable substitute.Salinger set up all future assignations for Kennedy while Jackie went on culture and shopping trips in the French capital.JFK had no aversion to prostitution or even sharing a mistress with his father, according to the author.He had lost his virginity to a streetwalker in Harlem while studying at Choate prep school. When he attended Harvard, his father, Joseph P. decided that Jack should have a grand tour of some of the legendary legal brothels in France. First stop was one run by Madame Billy, not of the same class as Madame Claude, but an old fashioned brothel with 20 pretty women and ten bedrooms.The father and son duo frequently re-visited the French whorehouses while traveling to the family\u0027s rented summer villa on the Côte d\u0027Azur, \u0027even after Jack had married Jackie and was elected to the Senate\u0027.  Among Madame Claude\u0027s most famous and high-profile clients are: Libyan Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, fashion designer Oleg Cassini, and actor Rex Harrison          Nelson Rockefeller was a client who reportedly loved to pinch the girls and was scolded by Claude for pinching so hard they were black-and-blue for a weekBut nothing topped Madame Claude\u0027s elite secret service.After that infamous night in Paris, the president had raved about his swan and the Camelot inner circle followed.Fashion designer Oleg Cassini asked to meet the same girl on his next trip to Paris but she wasn\u0027t his fantasy sex goddess.Elizabeth Taylor\u0027s fifth husband Richard Burton even became Madame Claude\u0027s favorite Hollywood star client. She adored British actors and he frequently sought out her services when he was having epic fights with Taylor and throughout his marriage.Actor Yul Brynner, Rex Harrison, and Marlon Brando were among her frequent clients. Harrison once requested two tall Scandinavians at one time, and Brando always preferred exotic Oceana types or Tahitian beauties which Madame Claude had trouble finding. So she sent her smartest girls who studied at the Sorbonne and instead of having sex with them, the actor lectured them until sunrise about global atrocities, human rights and other causes he championed.No one had more women than French director Roger Vadim, Jane Fonda\u0027s first husband.Three was never a crowd to the director who liked setting up scenes and giving orders. He introduced Fonda to the infamous threesomes she later complained she was forced into – all with girls ordered from Madame Claude.  Madame Claude, real name Fernande Grudet, was a one-woman and one-time show and very little was known about her during her \u0027reign.\u0027           The French madam fled Paris in 1977 to escape criminal charges after not paying taxes for years on undeclared income. Above she is pictured during her trial in 1986 When it came to clients Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas, their sexual requests were \u0027too depraved\u0027 to recount, the madame confessed to Stadiem.  Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. frequented Madame Claude, but it was during her stint in the US.She had fled France in 1977 to escape criminal charges after not paying taxes for years on undeclared income and she set up shop in Beverly Hills. Old and new clients continued calling.Sammy, according to the book, was a fan of her German swans. The comedian and Baron Elie de Rothschild were two of her top clients as was auto tycoon Gianni Agnelli who gifted her with a Fiat.Agnelli, a style maven, would dress his swans in sailor suits for the sexual encounters on his yacht.Sinatra was a devoted fan of her services until his new wife, Barbara, a tall, blonde, ex-showgirl herself, put the brakes on his frequent visits. Sinatra had snatched her from her ex-husband Zeppo Marx, his neighbor in Palm Springs.Brother Groucho Marx was on Claude\u0027s list and was often dragged to Paris by his longtime companion Erin Fleming who hired Claude\u0027s swans to attend to his never-lagging libido.\u0027Fleming\u0027s hope was that Groucho\u0027s sexual appetite would get the better of his coronary elasticity and accelerate her inheritance of his estate,\u0027 she is quoted in the book. It finally did when the great comic died in 1977 but his sons took the case to court declaring her a \u0027conniving gold digger\u0027 and she was forced to return some of the inheritance. Heads of state and even royals enlisted in Madame Claude\u0027s services.  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran, was the most generous and lavished precious jewels from Harry Winston on the many women she sent to his palace in Tehran.On one occasion, Claude sent a model who had become a radical Communist and shared her conversion with the shah.But he packed her off back to Paris without the jewels telling Claude: \u0027I cannot make love to a Communist.\u0027Mu\u0027ammar Gaddafi was supplied with a swan at the Ritz Hotel in Paris where she anticipated being fêted with champagne and caviar. Instead, he offered bottled water, dates, and a cassette with Arabic music.But Gaddafi did  eventually gift her with a diamond that she had put on her belly while she belly-danced for him all night. Plus-size model is left standing in her UNDERWEAR on Cannes...The Only Way Is Sussex!

Paul Getty made the girls use a pay telephone at his stately English home at Sutton Place to avoid having to pick up any long-distance charges.Nelson Rockefeller loved to pinch the girls and was scolded by Claude for pinching so hard they were black-and-blue for a week.But Alfred Bloomingdale, department store heir and creator of the Diners Club credit card as well as being the most notorious of the Reagan swingers, got his call girls from Hollywood Madame Alex. He was into sadomasochism.\u0027I wouldn\u0027t let Nelson Rockefeller pinch my girls why would I let Alfred Bloomingdale beat them? Claude told the author. Claude\u0027s girls were givers but never takers.   In Los Angeles, Claude was introduced to Joan Collins, pre her Dynasty TV show resurrection and her friend, Evie Bricusse, horror film actress.Seeing the Bulgari and Buccellati jewels the two women were consciously flaunting at lunch, Claude suggested they might be interested in earning a little extra money.Claude did have clients that enjoyed sampling a \u0027more seasoned\u0027 woman and even a faded star was attractive to some men.Joan asked if the offer included Evie, to which Claude responded: \u0027Absolutely not.\u0027 \u0027Claude was a dealer and these famous rich men were collectors\u0027, the author writes after extensive interviews with Claude to write her memoirs that never happened.\u0027The girl that Claude was selling was basically a luxury collectible, like a Warhol painting, a Cartier gem, a Gulfstream jet or a Beverly Hills mansion\u0027.\u0027Claude\u0027s blood, sweat, and tears were in creating the girls though the ones I met were found and not made\u0027.\u0027She was doing for bedrooms what Hollywood agents did for the screen, discovering and brokering talent\u0027.She was a one-woman and one-time show and very little was known about her. She was the most discreet of criminals and there was no paper trail.\u0027For the first half of her career, she was effectively an arm of the state, a very secret service,\u0027 the book states. \u0027She was the stuff of gossip, great gossip, great stuff, but never the stuff of tabloids.\u0027 With no close friends, no diaries, no letters, she kept a low profile.Madame Claude was born Fernande Grudet, a poor Jewish girl in Angers in western France. She had been a resistance fighter, concentration camp survivor, gun moll of the Corsican Mafia and streetwalker before brokering beauty to power.After leaving LA, she escaped to her cattle ranch in the South Pacific but was caught by Socialist Francois Mitterrand, arrested and sent to prison.She died in Nice on the French Riveria in 2015 at age 92. Madame Claude: Her Secret World of Pleasure, Privilege, and Power is available on Amazon.com "},{"url":null,"title":"LGBT Pride Month 2018 Dates celebrations Stonewall Riots","story":"Donald Glover fans take over pro-Trump forum on RedditGame of Thrones writer reveals Jon Snow\u0027s direwolf was cut from a season 7 sceneWill Smith and Nicky Jam to perform FIFA World Cup official anthemIvor Novello Awards 2018: All you need to knowGrey\u0027s Anatomy Season 15: All you need to knowShipwrecked reality TV show to be revived on E4New on HBO Now: June 2018 TV shows and movies revealedWho is Stacey Abrams?

When she returned she found Kidder had lost some 40 lb. \u0027She was the ever-shrinking woman,\u0027 she said.But she was still dedicated to the numerous progressive causes that she had devoted her life to, working for days on end with no rest, due to her bipolar condition.\u0027I called it Margieland,\u0027 said Willcox. \u0027Her life was chaos.

She knew I was the one person in the world that would understand that level of madness, and I was,\u0027 said Peacock.\u0027She was delusional and I understood what she was talking about as I had the same demons that were visiting her. She thought she was being followed by the CIA and her ex-husband.\u0027I just listened to her. We had a calm conversation and I didn\u0027t say get help or go see a shrink and she appreciated that. I had been in similar predicaments myself not knowing what was real and what was not.\u0027Kidder didn\u0027t even know Peacock well at the time. \u0027We were acquaintances and neighbors.

Margot had campaigned for him over the years.          Kidder and neighbor Doug Peacock became close friends after Kidder suffered a mental breakdown in Los Angeles in 1996.

She was often seen riding her bicycle around town. That bike was still parked outside the home four days after her death. A yellow coroner\u0027s tape sealed the door warning people to keep out. A woman at the house told DailyMail.com she wasn\u0027t ready to talk.The family\u0027s only comment was a statement from her son-in-law, Chad Franscoviak. \u0027On Mother\u0027s Day, my wife, Maggie McGuane, was brought by the Park County Coroner and Livingston Police Department into her mother Margot Kidder\u0027s home following her death, Franscoviak said.\u0027The experience has been difficult for her and she is choosing not to make public comment until after the findings of the Park County Coroner\u0027s office have been released. We ask that you respect our family\u0027s privacy during this sad time.\u0027Kidder married three times, but none of them lasted more than 18 months. She originally visited Livingston with first husband Thomas McGuane, who directed her in the movie 92 In The Shade, and fell in love with the area.But her marriage broke up soon after as McGuane was having an affair with her co-star Elizabeth Ashley.She was also married to actor John Heard for six days and French director Philippe de Broca. She famously had affairs with former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and directors Steven Spielberg and Brian de Palma. Maggie, 42, was her only child.After her third marriage fell apart in 1984, she said she preferred her dogs to men.Peacock remembered her as someone who loved dogs \u0027more than anyone I knew.\u0027 He said he had helped her bury one of her pets. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/21/4C81806B00000578-0-image-m-6_1526933840770.jpg","title":"Val Kilmer shares photos looking worn day posing fans Comic Con","story":"Batman forever: Val Kilmer appeared at Motor City Comic Con over the weekend in Detroit, and on Saturday posted photos of himself looking tired and worn out          Smiley: He spent the day posing for photos with fans who purchased his custom Funko pop toys, which sell for $80 and come with an autograph for another $80 (above)  Vacation: Kilmer was in New York City earlier in the week, attending a performance of Bruce Springsteen on Broadway (left) and heading out to Peter Brant\u0027s estate (right)          Number one: Fans later noted how polite and friendly Kilmer was on social mediaKilmer was on-hand to sell Funko pop toys made in the likeness of some of his film characters, with the actor charging $80 for the figure and another $80 for an autograph. He teased his appearance on Facebook earlier in the week.\u0027This Saturday \u0026amp Sunday, Detroit Comic Con, is getting closer.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. ‘The request came from Mr Putin,’ Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13billion (£10billion).He began spending time in London, where he owns a 15-bedroom Victorian mansion on ‘Billionaire’s Row’ in Kensington, bought in 2009 for a reported £97million and now worth at least £150million.

You would never catch her expressing an opinion in public — but she has her own way of making her views clear.So it is perhaps no coincidence that the Queen saw fit to confer upon Meghan Markle the title of Duchess of Sussex on the occasion of her marriage to Prince Harry.After all, there is no better county in Britain more suited to this most politically correct of new royals.It plays host to Brighton and Lewes, spiritual homes to those members of the liberal intelligentsia for whom Hampstead and Islington have become a trifle too reactionary.So what better title to confer on the couple who have just staged the most ‘woke’ wedding in royal history.For those unfamiliar with this fashionable expression, ‘woke’ denotes a person whose sensibilities are perfectly attuned to the modern way of thinking. That is to say, someone who is rigorously respectful of iniduals’ life choices and cultural traditions, scrupulously virtuous in both thoughts and deed — and who sees each new day as an opportunity to spread the gospel of inclusivity and ersity.It’s fair to say that the Royal Family has never been terribly ‘woke’.InjusticeSound asleep and snoring loudly might be a better way to describe their general attitude to political correctness, especially in the Duke of Edinburgh’s case.But Meghan and Harry are here to change all that, and their wedding was only the beginning.Less than 24 hours after saying her wedding vows, a biography of the Duchess of Sussex was put up on the royal website, underlining the selfless nature of her existence and her burning desire to oppose injustice in all its forms.Above all, it cites her ‘keen awareness of social issues’ and tells us she is ‘proud to be a woman and a feminist’.It also speaks of her ‘lifelong commitment’ to ‘social justice and women’s empowerment’.These are all deep preoccupations in the mind of the new duchess, the website informs us.But then we kind of knew that already, did we not? After all, Meghan and Harry seem to have spent the entire period of their engagement proselytising on such right-on issues.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, center, in Windsor Castle surrounded by their little loved ones. (From left back row) Brian Mulroney, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Jasper Dyer, Prince George, Ivy Mulroney, John Mulroney front row, Zalie Warren, Princess Charlotte and Florence van Cutsem          Meghan Markle\u0027s official page launched on the Kensington Palace website says she will continue with her charity work And for anyone who had not yet cottoned on to Meghan’s Mission, Saturday’s wedding ceremony will have made it crystal clear.There was the invitation to a former gang leader among 2,000 ‘ordinary’ guests invited to the wedding itself. And there was the request that instead of wedding gifts, donations could be given — among other worthy recipients — to a charity that empowers women in urban slums.Meghan and Harry’s big day was, as much as anything, an exercise in making sure the entire world knew exactly how much they cared about everyone as well as each other.The ultimate royal wedding souvenir... for sale on eBay:...\u0027Do the right thing, Meghan\u0027: Royal bride\u0027s sister calls on...Share this articleEverything about it was scrupulously politically correct, from the hand- embroidered flowers on her veil (representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth) and the choice of a non-polluting electric battery-powered car (albeit worth a very uninclusive £350,000) in which Harry drove them to the after-party at Frogmore House, to the dress itself, a £200,000 creation designed by the first British woman to head a Paris couture house.Even the flowers were locally sourced. As if that weren’t enough, Meghan took herself down the aisle (an audacious look-at-me move which is apparently a feminist triumph), succumbing only briefly to tradition to take Prince Charles’s arm — though note that he was not ‘giving her away’ — and wrote and delivered her own speech at the reception.But perhaps the strongest statement of all was the people in St George’s Chapel, the guests and performers.The American preacher Michael Curry who, with his iPad and Episcopal passion, blew away the cobwebs the brilliant young cellist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who held us all spellbound during the signing of the register the wonderful Kingdom Choir gospel ensemble, led by Karen Gibson.          An official photograph released by Kensington Palace shows Meghan and Harry surrounded by their loved ones, including the Queen and Prince Philip AdmireNot to mention all the representatives from various charities espoused by the royal couple.And then the celebrities, there for their roles as charity do-gooders as much as their glamour: David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Amal Clooney. Everywhere you looked, a festival of ersity and inclusivity, not a note out of place. It was perfect.Almost too perfect, some might say.Because for all the gushing tributes, there was something just a little ostentatious about all the sincerity.Don’t misunderstand me: I think that Harry and Meghan make a wonderful couple, and I am sure they will bring nothing but benefit to the Royal Family. And I admire their commitment to doing good in the world.But sometimes one gets the sense that they are ever-so-slightly just a little bit pleased with themselves, a little too keen to convey their selfless dedication to those less fortunate than they are.To be fair, this is a common affliction of the modern age.The days when royals such as Princess Anne just went off quietly and got on with their charity work without really mentioning it to anyone apart from the odd horse are, sadly, long gone.And it is hard to imagine a future monarch behaving like the Queen, full of warmth and generosity towards her subjects, yet at the same time able to maintain that all-important mystique that still surrounds the monarchy and makes it so compelling.For all the positives of Harry and Meghan’s all-star union, this is my one worry. That in seeking to show the world what a wonderfully modern couple they are, they will unintentionally undermine the institution of monarchy — and risk turning the whole thing into a circus of virtue-signalling.And the problem with that is that it becomes less about the people they wish to help, less about the causes and issues that Meghan is so passionate about — and all about them.Already with the wedding, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a sense that it was as much engineered to cast the couple in a certain beatific light as it was to honour those involved.There is no question that, as royal weddings go, this broke all the moulds in terms of overcoming barriers of class and race.          Feminist and activist Meghan Markle will not stop her charitable work when she begins royal duties, she confirmedElitistAt the same time, though, it also felt strangely elitist, as though they were simply replacing one exclusive club — the aristocracy — with another, Hollywood celebrity.The trick to any kind of modernisation is being able successfully to blend the old with the new without alienating either.To understand how and when to respect certain traditions and not to be subversive just for the sake of it.There is a lot about the Royal Family that remains sacred to the people of Britain, however irrational that can sometimes seem.Let us rejoice at the evolution of monarchy but let’s also not turn it into a glorified lifestyle blog for guilt- ridden millennials.It is wonderful that Meghan and Harry have such a shared passion for doing good in the world. And I have no doubt that, together, they will prove to be a great force for change.I just wish they would be a little less #MeToo about it all."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/02/4C83270400000578-0-image-a-23_1526953780212.jpg","title":"Charlize Theron set play Megyn Kelly film Fox News","story":"Charlize Theron (left) will play Megyn Kelly (right) in a film about Roger Ailes\u0027 downfall          Fox News anchors Chris Wallace (left), Megyn Kelly and Brett Baier (right) are seen at a Republican presidential debate in 2012.

The whole world seemed to centre around you and your beloved.\u0027Oh there\u0027s power, power in love. Not just in its romantic forms, but any form, any shape of love. There\u0027s a certain sense in which when you are loved, and you know it, when someone cares for you, and you know it, when you love and you show it - it actually feels right.\u0027There is something right about it. And there\u0027s a reason for it. The reason has to do with the source. We were made by a power of love, and our lives were meant - and are meant - to be lived in that love. That\u0027s why we are here.\u0027Ultimately, the source of love is God himself: the source of all of our lives. There\u0027s an old medieval poem that says: \u0027Where true love is found, God himself is there\u0027.\u0027The New Testament says it this way: \u0027Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and those who love are born of God and know God. Those who do not love do not know God.\u0027 Why? \u0027For God is love.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s power in love. There\u0027s power in love to help and heal when nothing else can.\u0027There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will.\u0027There\u0027s power in love to show us the way to live.\u0027Set me as a seal on your heart... a seal on your arm, for love is as strong as death.            Harry told his bride that he had missed her after their night apart and clutched her hand throughout the moving service\u0027But love is not only about a young couple. Now the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that we\u0027re all here. Two young people fell in love, and we all showed up.\u0027But it\u0027s not just for and about a young couple, who we rejoice with. It\u0027s more than that.\u0027Jesus of Nazareth on one occasion was asked by a lawyer to sum up the essence of the teachings of Moses, and he went back and he reached back into the Hebrew scriptures, to Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and Jesus said: \u0027You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself.\u0027\u0027And then in Matthew\u0027s version, he added, he said: \u0027On these two, love of God and love of neighbour, hang all the law, all the prophets, everything that Moses wrote, everything in the holy prophets, everything in the scriptures, everything that God has been trying to tell the world... love God, love your neighbours, and while you\u0027re at it, love yourself.\u0027\u0027Someone once said that Jesus began the most revolutionary movement in human history.\u0027A movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world - and a movement mandating people to live that love, and in so doing to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself.\u0027I\u0027m talking about power. Real power. Power to change the world.            Meghan and Harry were pronounced man and wife by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby\u0027If you don\u0027t believe me, well, there were some old slaves in America\u0027s Antebellum South who explained the dynamic power of love and why it has the power to transform.\u0027They explained it this way. They sang a spiritual, even in the midst of their captivity. It\u0027s one that says \u0027There is a balm in Gilead...\u0027 a healing balm, something that can make things right.\u0027\u0027There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole, there is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul.\u0027\u0027And one of the stanzas actually explains why. They said: \u0027If you cannot preach like Peter, and you cannot pray like Paul, you just tell the love of Jesus, how he died to save us all.\u0027\u0027\u0027Oh, that\u0027s the balm in Gilead! This way of love, it is the way of life. They got it. He died to save us all.\u0027He didn\u0027t die for anything he could get out of it. Jesus did not get an honorary doctorate for dying. He didn\u0027t... he wasn\u0027t getting anything out of it. He gave up his life, he sacrificed his life, for the good of others, for the good of the other, for the wellbeing of the world... for us.            But the tears turned to laughter when the star made him giggle as they exchanged vows in the extraordinarily moving ceremony watched by millions around the world\u0027That\u0027s what love is. Love is not selfish and self-centred. Love can be sacrificial, and in so doing, becomes redemptive. And that way of unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive love changes lives, and it can change this world.\u0027If you don\u0027t believe me, just stop and imagine. Think and imagine a world where love is the way.\u0027\u0027Imagine our homes and families where love is the way. Imagine neighbourhoods and communities where love is the way.\u0027Imagine governments and nations where love is the way. Imagine business and commerce where this love is the way.\u0027Imagine this tired old world where love is the way. When love is the way - unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive.\u0027When love is the way, then no child will go to bed hungry in this world ever again.\u0027When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook.\u0027When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the earth will be a sanctuary.\u0027When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields, down by the riverside, to study war no more.\u0027When love is the way, there\u0027s plenty good room - plenty good room - for all of God\u0027s children.\u0027Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well... like we are actually family.\u0027When love is the way, we know that God is the source of us all, and we are brothers and sisters, children of God.\u0027My brothers and sisters, that\u0027s a new heaven, a new earth, a new world, a new human family.\u0027And let me tell you something, old Solomon was right in the Old Testament: that\u0027s fire.\u0027Pierre Teilhard de Chardin - and with this I will sit down, we gotta get you all married - French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was arguably one of the great minds, great spirits of the 20th century.\u0027Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, scientist, a scholar, a mystic.\u0027In some of his writings, he said, from his scientific background as well as his theological one, in some of his writings he said - as others have - that the discovery, or invention, or harnessing of fire was one of the great scientific and technological discoveries in all of human history.\u0027Fire to a great extent made human civilisation possible. Fire made it possible to cook food and to provide sanitary ways of eating which reduced the spread of disease in its time.\u0027Fire made it possible to heat warm environments and thereby made human migration around the world a possibility, even into colder climates.\u0027Fire made it possible - there was no Bronze Age without fire, no Iron Age without fire, no Industrial Revolution without fire.\u0027The advances of fire and technology are greatly dependent on the human ability and capacity to take fire and use it for human good.\u0027Anybody get here in a car today? An automobile? Nod your heads if you did - I know there were some carriages. But those of us who came in cars, fire - the controlled, harnessed fire - made that possible.\u0027I know that the Bible says, and I believe it, that Jesus walked on the water. But I have to tell you, I did not walk across the Atlantic Ocean to get here.\u0027Controlled fire in that plane got me here. Fire makes it possible for us to text and tweet and email and Instagram and Facebook and socially be dysfunctional with each other.\u0027Fire makes all of that possible, and de Chardin said fire was one of the greatest discoveries in all of human history.\u0027And he then went on to say that if humanity ever harnesses the energy of fire again, if humanity ever captures the energy of love - it will be the second time in history that we have discovered fire.\u0027Dr King was right: we must discover love - the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world, a new world.\u0027My brother, my sister, God love you, God bless you, and may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love.\u0027                                                    "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/16/4C84A50100000578-5757945-Asia_Eriksen_usually_makes_a_batch_of_several_dolls_at_a_time_in-a-36_1527003646118.jpg","title":"Womans creepy werebabies proving unlikely success","story":"    The dolls can some times require months of intricate work to make           Asia Eriksen usually makes a batch of several dolls at a time in her Pennsylvania home          Asia with fan Alice Cooper, whose ghoulish stage presence seems to be match by the dolls Bought to commemorate a lost loved one, or just for a shocking accessory, Asia had to suspend orders for a year after demand exceeded her physical capabilities.Complete with real hair, the pups can sell for anywhere between 500 GBP  $670 (£500) to 1000 GBP ($1350 , and Asia\u0027s customers include horror icons such as Alice Cooper and Robert Englund, famous for playing Freddy Krueger in Nightmare on Elm Street.But Asia, who created the original Werepup after experimenting with her husband\u0027s art supplies, admits it\u0027s the stories of the everyday customer - such as helping someone to cope with a terminal illness - that keeps her inspired to continue creating.Speaking to The Wizard of Odd TV, Asia said: \u0027The lab is filled with all kinds of medical oddities collected throughout the years - it creates an atmosphere that helps me get in the mood to create.

She also co-founded and served as the senior vice president of the financial services firm, NOW Corp.She also founded a children’s beverage company called Nourish, is CEO of legal consulting firm Sage Works and, under the pseudonym Selena Montgomery, has written many romantic suspense novels and has sold more than 100,000 copies.Stacey Abrams, Minority Leader of the Georgia House of RepresentativesFrom 2007, Abrams became the first woman to lead either party in the Georgia General Assembly and the first African American to lead in the House of Representatives.As Minority Leader, she worked with Republican Governor Nathan Deal’s administration to reform the HOPE Scholarship Program and co-sponsored the legislation that preserved the initiative by decreasing the scholarship paid to Georgia students, as well as funding a low-interest loan program.  Stacey Abrams seen here announcing she has qualified to run for governor in Atlanta in 2018Despite having similar policies, as Vox explained, the difference in the policies of Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans comes down to their different handling of the HOPE Scholarship Program.‘This dispute has several ins and outs, but the basic shape of things is that Deal proposed swinging cuts to the program that once guaranteed free in-state tuition to any Georgia high school graduate who maintained at least a B average.‘Abrams cut a deal with Deal that reduced the extent of the cuts but still pared back the program substantially. Evans stood strong in opposition,’ Vox reported.Georgia Primary 2018Stacey Abrams is running for Governor of Georgia in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election and she will be up against Stacey Evans in the Democratic primary in what has been dubbed ‘the war between the two Staceys.’Both Staceys have similar policies on health care, education and their opposition to President Donald Trump. The Democrat representative for Georgia will be announced on May 22, 2018, in an attempt to damage Republican control over the state.Despite Georgia being far from a swing state, Hillary Clinton was close to winning in the state during the 2016 election, more so than Ohio or Iowa, and this has given the Democratic Party hope of electing a governor there for the first time since Roy Barnes in 1998.This being an important election, it has garnered media attention along with GOP contender Michael Williams breaking news with his idea of touring Georgia with a ‘deportation bus’. But he is unlikely to make it to the runoff election in July 24, with the Republican nomination thought to be won by Casey Cagle or Brian Kemp.Stacey Abrams pollsPolls conducted for FOX 5 Atlanta reveal Stacey Abrams is leading the race for the Democratic nomination for Governor with 58.2 per cent, with Stacey Evans at 19 per cent and 23 per cent left undecided.  Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Evans seen here participating in a debateCasey Cagle is in the lead for the Republican nomination at 30.5 per cent, with Brian Kemp in second place with 19.5 per cent.Stacey Abrams endorsementsHillary Clinton endorsed Stacey Abrams as the Democratic candidate over former state representative Stacey Evans and said: ‘A Yale educated attorney, Abrams is the only candidate with bold new plans to ensure Georgians have access to good jobs, quality public schools, affordable child care and higher education.’Abrams has also been endorsed by Bernie Sanders, who said that she had ‘real solutions that will help the lives of working people in Georgia’. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris have both also endorsed Stacey Abrams.Donald Glover fans take over pro-Trump forum on RedditGame of Thrones writer reveals Jon Snow\u0027s direwolf was cut from a season 7 sceneWill Smith and Nicky Jam to perform FIFA World Cup official anthemIvor Novello Awards 2018: All you need to knowGrey\u0027s Anatomy Season 15: All you need to knowShipwrecked reality TV show to be revived on E4New on HBO Now: June 2018 TV shows and movies revealedWho is Stacey Abrams?

In 2015, she reportedly told the journalist Piers Morgan that she had not always sought showbusiness success.‘As a kid, I wanted to be either the president or a news broadcaster like you,’ she told him.          The actress married Prince Harry after meeting him in London in 2016. She has now become the Duchess of Sussex          Meghan Markle is expected to become a British citizen but she has harboured dreams of becoming President of the USMeghan is still a U.S. citizen because the process to become a fully-fledged Briton is expected to take three years. She is expected to retain her U.S. citizenship, as dual citizenship is permitted. Presidential candidates must be U.S. citizens.Meghan has cultivated a warm friendship with former U.S. president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, while chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the most influential women in America, was given a prime seat at St George’s Chapel Windsor, opposite the Royal Family.A royal historian says Meghan would find it difficult to enter U.S. politics while still married to Harry. ‘It is a pretty strong rule that members of the Royal Family keep out of politics,’ he says.Share this article    The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, leaving Windsor Castle after their weddingBut Harry could, of course, give up official royal duties. His mother, Princess Diana, was said to have considered moving to America.And the claim appears to have caused consternation at Kensington Palace yesterday, with the Duchess giving her official spokesman permission to take the unusual step of issuing a public denial.‘This conversation you describe with an associate is fictitious,’ the spokesman insisted.I am, though, not the only one to hear rumours that Meghan still holds political ambitions.Former Times editor Sir Simon Jenkins says: ‘Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal.‘Such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. She might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. All I can say is, why not?’Meghan’s best friend is Jessica Mulroney, whose father-in-law, Brian, was prime minister of Canada for nine years.Meghan has strong political views and attacked Donald Trump in 2016 for being ‘isive’ and ‘misogynistic’. She might have to reach an accommodation with her new chum George Clooney, who is said to hold political ambitions of his own. Perhaps he could be her running mate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/22/23/4C898F2700000578-0-image-a-4_1527026592018.jpg","title":"Official royal wedding gift bag sells 21 400 eBay","story":"    Included in the listing was a bottle of Windsor Castle spring water, a fridge magnet, an over-sized chocolate coin, a tin of shortbread biscuits, a spectator badge, a spectator wristband, a parking sticker, the order of service, a postcard, a map and day briefing, entry card letter and finally the tote bag itself          Auctioning under the name ClaireOliver87, the listing included the entire contents of the gift bag as well as the paperwork received on and prior to the dayThe guests arrived at 9am to see 600 VIPs including the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles as well as the Clooneys, the Beckhams, Elton John and Oprah Winfrey turn up for the A-list wedding of the decade. And as 120,000 well-wishers fought for space outside the castle these privileged 1,200 were able to get great views of the newlyweds as they kissed outside the chapel and paraded past in the royal Ascot Landau carriage. But within hours of the event finishing dozens of their free hessian gift bags were being auctioned off to the highest bidder.Many of the sellers had clearly planned to do it in advance because they photographed the items outside St George\u0027s Chapel to ensure they looked genuine on eBay.           Bids for items have now reached more than £1,000 even though they were handed out for free by Meghan and Harry  Guests invited by Meghan and Harry to see them marry are already cashing in by selling their gift bags on eBay for £400 or more          Guests arriving in the grounds of Windsor Castle passed tables where bags were handed out to each guest but some have taken advantage of this generosity          The canvas bags had the happy couple\u0027s initials on the side and are being sold on the promise buyers will be getting a piece of royal wedding historySo why WERE the Beckhams and Clooneys (not to mention Chloe...Why did George and Charlotte suddenly go missing?

According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

Bush lifted some sanctions. But when talks collapsed the Yongbyon cooling tower was quickly rebuilt and the reactor restarted.In the intervening years, with diplomacy going nowhere, North Korea went on to test five more nuclear devices and develop missiles it said was capable of reaching the United States.To experts, North Korea dismantling nuclear site is like destroying evidence - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/02/4C7BC5DF00000578-0-image-m-71_1526867207165.jpg","title":"The history Windsor Castles iconic Green Drawing Room","story":"    Heart-warming: The Queen Mother filmed holding baby Harry in the Green Drawing Room after his christening in 1984           It was the historic room that set the backdrop for the official wedding photographs of Prince Harry and Meghan after their stunning wedding ceremony on Saturday          Baby-faced: Prince Harry looks wide-eyed as he is held by his mother Princess Diana ahead of his christening           Cheeky: Prince Charles filmed scooping up a mischievous Prince William who was running around the Green Drawing Room           Baby Harry: Princess Diana, a vision in royal blue, holds Harry as she beckons his cousins to come over and say hello to him The robe, worn by the Prince of Wales as well as Prince Harry, was designed by Queen Victoria\u0027s dress maker and crafted from lace and satin.It was commissioned for her first child in 1841, and was worn by over 60 royal babies up until 2004, when it became too fragile to wear.Little did baby Prince Harry know that in three decades time he would return to the glamorous chamber - this time to pose in his wedding finery alongside his beautiful bride the former US actress Meghan Markle.   In the historic footage, broadcast as part of the Queen\u0027s 1984 Christmas message, the grand reception room is filled with familiar faces of the royal family who are celebrating baby Harry\u0027s christening. It\u0027s hardly Royal Ascot!

Newton said Kerridge’s book set a UK record for selling the most copies in a week in January, as New Year resolutions were put into practice.“We have signed a contract for Tom’s next book too. We hope it will be as big as this one,” he said. “It will come out in December ahead of the New Year when people are filled with worthy resolutions for health, good food and fitness.” The company is continuing to receive a fillip from sales of the The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, thanks to the film version of the historical novel it first published a decade ago, starring Downton Abbey actor Lily James.Newton said this was the result of a strategy to broaden the scope of the publisher’s business and build digital revenues as well as academic and professional publishing operations. “We have been seeking for 10 years now to create a balanced portfolio between general publishing and academic and professional publishing,” he said. “What you see coming through in the results is that the fruits of that strategy.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06b633698fd97f72be7fb6c90277c9484afc6ad/0_117_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce0bc3481757ccef8a17c811b716a39","title":"olga tokarczuk flights wins man booker international prize polish","story":"The Polish novelist takes £50,000 prize, to be shared with her translator, for a story that moves from ‘wit and gleeful mischief to real emotional texture’Olga Tokarczuk has become the first Polish writer to win the Man Booker International prize, which goes to the best work of translated fiction from anywhere in the world.More than 100 novels were submitted for the 2018 award, and Tokarczuk’s Flights saw off work by two former winners – South Korea’s Han Kang and Hungary’s László Krasznahorkai – to secure the £50,000 prize, which is shared equally with her English translator Jennifer Croft.Tokarczuk is a bestselling author in Poland, where she has won numerous awards and is a household name. In Flights, she meditates on travel and human anatomy, moving between stories including the Dutch anatomist who discovered the Achilles tendon when dissecting his own amputated leg, and the tale of Chopin’s heart as his sister transported it from Paris to Warsaw.“It isn’t a traditional narrative,” said chair of judges Lisa Appignanesi, pointing to Tokarczuk’s own description of her writing as “constellation novels” to describe an author who throws her stories into orbit, allowing her readers to form meaningful shapes from them. “We loved the voice of the narrative – it’s one that moves from wit and gleeful mischief to real emotional texture and has the ability to create character very quickly, with interesting digression and speculation.”The book’s themes – “the nomadic life that we now lead in the world, with our constant movement, our constant desire to pick up and go, whether it’s from relationships or whether it’s to other countries”, and “the limitedness, the finiteness, the mortality of the human body, which is always pulled towards the ground” – collide in Tokarczuk’s “extraordinary” stories, said Appignanesi. She also praised the novel’s translation by Croft, an American who translates from Polish, Spanish and Ukrainian and is a founding editor of the Buenos Aires Review.Selecting Flights from a shortlist that also featured the Spanish author Antonio Muñoz Molina, Iraq’s Ahmed Saadawi and France’s Virginie Despentes was “so hard”, said Appignanesi, but Tokarczuk is “a writer of wonderful wit, imagination and literary panache” who has “has written a great many books that sound amazing, but which haven’t been translated yet”.“We really felt this is a prize that has an interventionist quality – it allows writers to be better known in Britain, and in the English language, than they have been previously,” said Appignanesi. Flights, which is published by the tiny independent press Fitzcarraldo Editions, is only the third of Tokarczuk’s 10 books to be published in English. Her 2009 novel Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead is due out in September 2018, while The Books of Jacob, a 900-page historical epic that sold 170,000 copies in hardback in Poland and won her a Nike award – known as “the Polish Booker” – for the second time back in 2014, is due out in 2019.According to Appignanesi, translated fiction is “incredibly important”, particularly today, “when we seem to have this recrudescence of a kind of nationalism that would rather have insularity and homegrown-ness as the way of the world”.Appignanesi was joined on the judging panel by poet and translator Michael Hofmann, the novelists Hari Kunzru and Helen Oyeyemi and journalist Tim Martin.Tokarczuk and Croft were presented with their awards on Tuesday night at a ceremony in London’s Victoria and Albert Museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ba28eec00a70072248d293fda89fddf276bdab/239_59_6481_3889/master/6481.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=045aa1a4c6f8cd83ef9882fd054752af","title":"marks spencer close stores","story":"Retailer, which has already axed 22 outlets, reveals 14 more that will shut in the next year•Full list of M\u0026ampS store closures announced so farMarks \u0026amp Spencer is closing one in three of its core clothing and home branches in a dramatic retreat from the UK high street that will trigger thousands of job losses.M\u0026ampS on Tuesday revealed plans to close a total of 100 shops by 2022, as it expanded an existing store closure programme. It said the closures were vital for the future of the struggling retail business but Usdaw, the shopworkers’ union, accused M\u0026ampS of “salami slicing”, as staff came to terms with a third wave of store closures. The retailer has embarked on a “radical transformation” plan intended to tackle years of falling sales and profits. M\u0026ampS has confirmed the locations of only 36 store closures so far, including the identities of a further 14 sites that were revealed on Tuesday as part of the enlarged programme. The cull began 18 months ago when the chief executive, Steve Rowe, said he would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to M\u0026ampS’s clothing ranges.Sacha Berendji, the Marks \u0026amp Spencer retail, operations and property director, said the company was trying to make its store estate “more relevant” and better able to support the growth of its website. With another 64 branches still to be earmarked for closure under the cuts, the process is creating huge uncertainty for staff. So far the programme has affected 1,500 out of 72,000 UK shop staff. “Closing stores isn’t easy but it is vital for the future of M\u0026ampS,” Berendji said. “Where we have closed stores, we are seeing an encouraging number of customers moving to nearby stores … which is why we’re continuing to transform our estate with pace.”Three stores – Bayswater, Fleetwood outlet and Newton Abbot outlet – will close by the end of July while Holloway Road in London and Clacton-on-Sea in Essex will close by early next year as they are replaced by nearby food-only outlets.Darlington, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Northampton, Stockton and Walsall are proposed for closure and will enter a period of consultation with employees. M\u0026ampS said it would aim to redeploy staff before considering redundancies.M\u0026ampS’s announcement comes as UK retailers line up a wave of closures amid tough trading conditions and rising costs. Last week Mothercare announced plans to shut 50 stores, putting at least 800 jobs at risk. Fashion chain New Look is shutting 60 outlets and House of Fraser is also planning at least 20 closures.Outside the Holloway Road store on Tuesday, which first opened its doors in 1914, shoppers reacted with shock. The once grand frontage, complete with classical pillars, is pockmarked by holes from previous signage, the windows grimy with old paint and the interior dated. But there was a steady flow of shoppers browsing the clothes as well as the food aisles.Margaret Late, 68, said she had been visiting the store for about 40 years. “I come down every week but I rarely buy anything as I find it too expensive. I do like to get my underwear here and sometimes my husband’s jeans but I prefer Bonmarche for clothes. It’s cheaper and nicer stuff. It’s a shame for M\u0026ampS to go, though. It will probably end up as a pound shop.”Sofya Gaal, 39, said she had been using the store for most of the 22 years she has lived nearby. “It’s a shame it’s closing, it’s probably because of online. I shop online but I like to come out to the shop and get some fresh air. I probably come here three or four times a week.”The Usdaw national officer David Gill said: “Staff in all M\u0026ampS stores were extremely concerned about what the future holds when the company announced a wide-ranging store reorganisation in November 2016.“At the time they did not say where the axe will fall by detailing which stores are set to close,” said Gill. “Today we’ve seen a third wave of closures announced, which is devastating news for the staff in those stores and the uncertainty continues for everyone else. This salami slicing approach to reorganising the business is extremely distressing for the staff.”One retail consultancy said M\u0026ampS was in danger of losing its crown as the UK’s largest clothing retailer.‘‘Marks \u0026amp Spencer has dominated the UK clothing market for decades, but its lead as number one is perilously close to being lost to Primark this year,” said Maureen Hinton, a research director at GlobalData. “The closure of yet more stores will hasten the decline unless it can shift the lost sales to its online channel and transfer to its other stores.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/326811849dda01c76bf7115a55ec4431ceacc1ab/0_0_4252_2550/master/4252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=429572bdb44874f1b1082807687e0852 1240w","title":"tesco shuts its online non food website tesco direct","story":"500 jobs at risk as company concludes it cannot make the loss-making arm profitableTesco is shutting down its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk.Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant’s attempt to take on Argos and Amazon by selling everything from sofas to TVs and toys.Tesco admitted it couldn’t see a way to make the website, which launched in 2006, profitable. As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy.“This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,” said Charles Wilson who recently took over as boss of Tesco’s UK chain. “We want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that’s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.”Tesco has been running two separate internet businesses in tandem: Tesco for for grocery home deliveries and the Direct catalogue-style website for household goods and clothing, including its own F\u0026ampF brand.Tesco said the website, which will cease trading on 9 July, had struggled with the high cost of fulfilling orders and online marketing. Tesco said the plan would mean the closure of the distribution centre at Fenny Lock, Milton Keynes, which handles Tesco Direct orders.Tesco Direct was one of the many pushes launched during the expansionist reign of Sir Terry Leahy in which the retailer became a jack of all trades, with side projects that included building flats, running a bank as well as selling groceries, clothing and household goods online. Current boss Dave Lewis, who took charge in the wake of the 2014 accounting scandal, has led a radical restructuring of the UK’s biggest retailer. He sold a number of businesses, including its South Korean chain Homeplus for £4bn, and pushed through a programme of large-scale domestic job losses. Last year Lewis did his first major deal with the purchase of the Booker cash and carry chain, led by Wilson, for £3.7bn. The complexity of bashing together the two businesses, which have combined turnover of nearly £60bn, means the loss-making Direct business was a headache neither executive needed.“I think this shows a renewed focus on the machine that is Tesco,” said Steve Dresser, retail analyst at Grocery Insight. “The days of going after markets with no realistic proposition of them adding value are long gone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c322b2657a41c32447bf525d68dd7aaac34dcfe/0_402_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa22a59d6dc3e3538498ccb398256f3","title":"the guardian view on goves clean air plan just hot air","story":"Michael Gove, the environment secretary, made his name during the Brexit campaign for quipping that “the people have had enough of experts” and likening economists who warned against leaving the European Union to Nazi propagandists against Einstein.

This\u0026nbspweek Mr Gove was at it again: making headlines without making policy. The cabinet minister produced a clean air strategy which purported to tackle a public health crisis by getting families to open their windows more often because “air pollution inside the home can often be higher than outside”.

Instead, his plan envisages local authorities finding the cash, presumably by defunding libraries or other essential public goods, to pay for an army of local inspectors to check the dryness of the wood being sold on petrol station forecourts that is used as fuel for stoves. Given his policy’s impotence, it would be absurd to say Mr Gove is taking the issue seriously. As lives are at stake, it is actually offensive.It is also audacious to argue, as the environment secretary did, that “Brexit will allow us to clean up Britain’s air” when his government’s air pollution plan has been rejected by the courts three times because it failed to meet legal limits set by the EU\u0026nbspeight years ago. It becomes outrageous when one knows that Mr Gove’s strategy is a response to an EU air quality law that set legally binding emission reduction targets for five pollutants.The question is whether such a committed Brexiter would develop such a strategy if we were not in the\u0026nbspEU? Mr Gove’s record of pushing for deregulation and repressing teaching on climate change in schools bodes ill. He was found to be acting illegally under EU laws, which can be disappeared from March 2019. Who will hold the government to account following Brexit? Will it be Mr Gove’s environmental watchdog, one so toothless it can only scare ministers into meeting standards by issuing advisory notices? If\u0026nbspthat is the enforcement agency, then every climate sceptic and fossil fuel fan ought to be celebrating in the streets.If ministers are serious about dealing with a public health emergency that is “cutting lives short, damaging children’s health and poisoning our natural environment”, then they will have to change the car culture in this country and support that kind of change in behaviour by going with the grain of what people want to do, which is to be sustainably mobile. The government needs to encourage a virtuous circle of declining car use coupled with increasing use of greener modes of public transport. This needs cash, and crucially must allow local government to charge motorists to use road space. Ministers will have to face down the motor lobby and embrace electric cars, as they have done in Norway. Charging car batteries from central power stations is more efficient than burning fuel in separate engines. If Mr Gove wants to be remembered for more than just PR stunts that ert attention from a trick being pulled, he should adopt a policy that hastens the demise of the internal combustion engine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d115ea7244c6941fe11af1ec67d2c5403c0d93f/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc02d6969e357aeece2b840d797704bd","title":"when the media starts celebrating hipster fascists something has gone very wrong","story":"The Sunday Times profiled members of Generation Identity and made them look like members of a boyband. This dangerous trend of humanising extremists must stopFascism is all the rage these days. Hate is haute, white nationalism is the new black and neo-nazism never looked so good. So the Sunday Times – which recently published a piece about the white nationalist movement Generation Identity (GI) – would have you believe, anyway.You may have heard about GI before. They’re the extremists who physically tried to stop refugee rescue boats from coming to Europe last year. The correct word to describe those who actively seek to oppress suffering people is “monsters”. Actually, “incompetent monsters” may be more appropriate – GI’s vessel got into difficulty off the coast of Libya during one of its anti-migrant missions and an NGO’s rescue ship ended up helping out. Sometimes karma is a boat. The Sunday Times had another way of describing GI, though. Its headline called its members “hipster fascists”. As if that wasn’t vomit-inducing enough, the title of the print version was: “Heil hipsters.”The dubious headline might have been forgivable if the Sunday Times had gone on to unequivocally call a racist a racist and profiled the people GI’s “activism” has had an impact on if they had talked about the families on the rescue boats fleeing unspeakable horrors or the rise in hate crime in the UK.But, no, what it seemed most interested in was GI’s clothes. “Middle-class and well-spoken, dressed in skinny jeans and New Balance trainers rather than bomber jackets and boots, members of Generation Identity are accused of using slick branding and coded language to ‘normalise’ extremist views,” said the much-maligned piece. It crowned the article with a picture of the GI leaders that made them look like members of a boyband.Guess what? It’s not New Balance trainers or skinny jeans that are normalising extremist views, it’s the media. The Sunday Times piece is the latest in a series of problematically chatty articles about fringe figures that have been published in mainstream outlets. It’s only the most recent example of a dangerous trend of the media humanising and legitimising white extremists.Profiles of fascists tend to come in different flavours. Some, like this one, are packaged as quirky trend stories. While they may make a halfhearted nod to the fact that these rightwing groups are, ya know, sort of bad, these stories also trivialise them. They dress neo-nazism up like it’s just a bit of youthful, swashbuckling fun. In 2016, for example, the Evening Standard wrote a piece headlined: “Meet the ‘fascie’ pack.” This came out shortly after Mother Jones had profiled Richard Spencer in an article headlined: “Meet the dapper White Nationalist.” (After much internet outrage Mother Jones removed the “dapper.”) Please just pause for a moment and imagine if outlets like these had run pieces on dapper jihadists or how Isis members look really dashing in black? Yeah, it wouldn’t happen.Not every darling of the “alt-right” is a fascist or racist, of course, but neither are they simply intellectual retrogrades crusading for free speech, as some coverage suggests. The most recent example of this is the New York Times’s story about the “intellectual dark web”, which profiled rightwing favourites such as Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro. This article had the audacity to present Peterson et al not as incredibly problematic reactionaries, who have been given high-profile platforms, but as “iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities … largely locked out of legacy outlets”.It shouldn’t need to be said, but there is nothing trendy about being a racist nothing quirky about being a misogynist and nothing fashionable about being a fascist. Please, please can the media put an end to stories that suggest anything otherwise?A couple of years ago, I got served an online ad for an “egg-freezing party in NYC”. Apparently, there would be free cocktails and presentations from fertility-clinic executives about the benefits of putting your ageing eggs on ice. I didn’t go to the party, but it piqued my interest. At the time, it seemed everyone was extolling the virtues of elective oocyte cryopreservation, as it is called. A lot of my friends in their late-20s and 30s were talking about freezing their eggs or had already done so. And celebrities were also giving it the seal of approval. Indeed, in 2016, the actor Olivia Munn said in a podcast that she thought “every girl should do it”.While the researchers weren’t sure why some women regretted their decision, a possible contributing factor cited was that egg-freezing “was emotionally more complex than people may have assumed initially”. Another possible factor, mentioned in a commentary published alongside the study, was that women overestimated how effective it was.The egg-freezing research came out around the same time it was announced that birthrates in the US have fallen to a 30-year low. Together, the studies paint a depressing picture of the commodification of childbirth in the US. In a country with some of the worst maternity laws and priciest childcare in the world, kids have become luxury items."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a830a26327cee1b038c2045aef2376d04476b806/0_0_3300_2271/master/3300.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=92a2249dbb33124f703bd063d1f2f6f9 2020w","title":"great british bee count 2018 in pictures","story":"As the fifth annual Great British Bee Count gets under way, wildlife and gardening experts are calling on the public to grow weeds to help Britain’s bees.

This is an iconic Givenchy shape, sometimes called the Sabrina neckline, after the evening dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1954 film. There is a rabbit hole here about whether the clothes in Sabrina should be attributed to the late Hubert de Givenchy or to the costume designer Edith Head, but never mind that: our takeaway here is that the bateau neckline is a very good look.A bateauboatSabrina neckline is much more flattering than a crew neck, which can make one’s torso look boxy. A bateau neckline gives you a waist. (A deep V-neck does the same, but the bateau line is more modern. A polo neck is flattering, too, because it elongates your line, but it would look odd at a wedding.) Vivienne Westwood, who knows a thing or two about a flattering dress, always has a bateau neckline up her sleeve and this season is no exception. On the catwalk at Paris fashion week, Jacquemus featured a bateau neckline dress with a turban-style hair wrap and mismatched earrings in his spring 2018 collection, while, on the high street, Cos has a crisp, wide-neck top with tortoiseshell button detailing at each shoulder for £49.The box-office smash on the guest list was Amal Clooney, who hasn’t looked this glamorous since her own wedding four years ago. (That cream jumpsuit in Venice was Stella McCartney, as was this weekend’s yellow number. Note to Clooney: always wear McCartney.) But yellow is very tricky. Yes, Clooney pulled it off, but who wants to go toe to toe with a human rights lawyer who wears 4in heels to court, finds time to co-host the Met Gala with Anna Wintour and nabs an impressive trophy husband, all without seeming to break a sweat? Not me. I am taking my tips instead from the Suits actor Abigail Spencer, whose polka dot Alessandra Rich dress on Saturday was fangirled over by all the fashion insiders.Hot on the bare heels of Kristen Stewart shoeless at Cannes came Serena Williams, who swapped the heels she wore with her daytime look for a pair of trainers under her Valentino ball-skirt. I hear the first dance was to Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance With Somebody I like to imagine the 23-time Grand Slam champion brought to the floor the moves that earned her a Beyoncé video cameo.Markle has enshrined herself as a feminist hero to multitasking women all over the world, by effectively giving a royal warrant to twisting up your hair, sticking some kirby grips in it and calling it an updo. OK, not exactly. The bride’s hair for the day was an idealised version of the messy bun, styled by Serge Normant, and the tendrils that framed her face for the evening were teased into shape by the king of the flattering bendy wave, George Northwood. But the principle remains. If Markle doesn’t need a chignon or a blowout with 40 million people watching, you can definitely get away with the old dry-shampoo-and-Elnett trick for Tim and Lola’s barbecue.See: Idris Elba in his Oscar-worthy black suit and Prince Harry in black tie, driving his new bride to their evening party in their zero-emissions Jaguar E-type. This wedding finally overthrew the stereotype of the scruffy British male. And yes, that is polite code for: “Oh my God, how hot is David Beckham?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69c91fa4b1c2e5760ae1a2e4f5b59c852f5ebfd7/0_164_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99714f89e9e8bdf24e7874abe64317a6","title":"arsenal ivan gazidis unai emery mikel arteta new manager wenger","story":"Ivan Gazidis met the higher-ups at Real Madrid in August 2013 with the intention of signing one player – Ángel Di María. The Spanish club would not sell and, what was more, they told the Arsenal chief executive he could not have anybody.Then Gazidis’s stars aligned. Over at the Real training pitches the club’s new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, told Mesut Özil he would not be assured of a starting place. Özil threw his toys and, rather abruptly, Gazidis was told he could take the Germany superstar, which he did.Gazidis is fond of telling the story because it has plenty of zesty ingredients, not least football’s everlasting capacity to surprise. But he tells it, more than anything, because it was a cool thing to have been a part of and, at times like these, even men in his position and with his icy temperament can be touched by a childlike excitement.Gazidis is, first and foremost, a football lover. Born in Johannesburg, he moved to Manchester at the age of four where he supported City and was an outstanding schoolboy player. Having obtained a masters in law, he pursued his career as a lawyer but the bug did not leave him. Gazidis was one of the founder members of Major League Soccer in the United States, and he worked there until 2008.The Özil deal has been one of the high points of Gazidis’s nine and a half years at Arsenal and yet the opportunistic element to it did not seem to fit with his personality. Gazidis is not an off-the-cuff operator. He is a contemplator, a deep thinker, who will calmly consider each decision from every conceivable angle. Perhaps he quickly concluded that Özil was a no-brainer he did not have to over-analyse this one.Gazidis is primed to announce the most significant signing of his career and, as the process to appoint a managerial successor to Arsène Wenger approached its endgame last week, there was the temptation to wonder, once again, whether he was about to act out of character. The 53-year-old is, by nature, risk-averse and not inclined to roll the dice. And yet he looked set to go for Mikel Arteta – a man with zero experience of being a manager.Gazidis sounds like a marketing executive when he describes Arsenal’s determination to do things their way, even if it means going against the grain. “We zig where others zag,” he once said. They were ready to zig and then some.Something changed over the weekend and, rather than Arteta, Gazidis is now putting the finishing touches to the appointment of Unai Emery, the former Paris Saint-Germain and Sevilla manager – an altogether safer bet, despite his often volatile touchline manner. Many will say the Arsenal squad, so indulged by Wenger, need an iron-fist-in-an-iron-glove kind of guy.The club have attempted a piece of revisionism and who can blame them? There was from the outset only one outstanding candidate for the job, they say, and he is about to get it. Why, then, were discussions so advanced with Arteta that the conversation had turned to his backroom staff? On Sunday night he still expected to be offered the post.Maybe it was a fiendish attempt by Gazidis and his inner circle to throw people off the scent, to use Arteta as a smokescreen for Emery, before dashing his hopes at the last. Or maybe not. It is simply not Gazidis’s style.More likely is that, when push came to shove, Gazidis played the percentages. Emery has experience, pedigree. He is an outstanding candidate because of his body of work over 14 seasons in management, particularly at Sevilla, where he won three Europa Leagues in a row.Why is there still the feeling that Gazidis has somehow copped out that he has taken the middle ground? Emery does not have the cachet of Ancelotti, Max Allegri or Luis Enrique while, at the other end of the spectrum, neither does the appointment fire the imagination in the same way that Arteta or Patrick Vieira might have done. Arsenal had an interest in Thomas Tuchel but he chose PSG. Now they have the man supplanted by him in Paris.The broader context to the decision-making process has been shaped by Gazidis’s experience of working alongside, or underneath, everybody’s favourite benevolent dictator, Wenger.Gazidis has long advocated a management structure that does not rest on a single point or employee because, when it fails, there is the potential for the whole thing to collapse. He has wanted a broader coalition of talented specialists greater than the sum of its parts and, for so long, his efforts were frustrated by Wenger, to whom the club’s majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, was in\u0026nbspthrall.Wenger had a hotline to Kroenke and he could shape or veto Gazidis’s ideas. Gazidis wanted a director of football but Wenger pushed his friend Dick Law into a position of executive-level authority. Gazidis wanted greater expertise in data and contracts and hired Hendrik Almstadt only for Wenger to say he did not want him. Almstadt ended up going to Aston Villa.Gazidis oversaw the purchase of the data analytics company, StatDNA, but Wenger was not a fan. Gazidis wanted to find a role for Arteta after he retired as a player at the club in 2016 but Wenger had warned that “you cannot create artificial\u0026nbsppositions”.A criticism of Gazidis is that he picks his battles so carefully he avoids having them at all that he did not do enough to fight Wenger for so many years and, consequently, the club was allowed to drift. There was the sense he feared that to fall out with Wenger would be to lose his job.But, as the writing came to be writ larger on the wall for Wenger, Gazidis made his move. He said at the end of the 2015-16 season that the on-field under-achievement had to serve as the “catalyst for change” and, since then he has manoeuvred a clutch of new hires into position.Gazidis has overhauled the structures at the club, with the most important appointments being those of Raúl Sanllehí, the director of football in all but name, and Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment. Huss Fahmy has come in to handle player contracts and Gazidis has finally realised his vision – the creation of a bespoke support system around the manager, whose role is purely to coach the first team. Emery is merely the final piece in the jigsaw, albeit the pivotal one.It was a meticulously orchestrated coup and Gazidis carried it off while showing all the respect in the world to Wenger, who has watched virtually all of his people leave the club. It has felt like a plot-line from Gomorrah, the Neapolitan mafia drama. Gazidis was not always the favourite to outlast Wenger. Now, his position looks stronger than ever.With power comes public profile and Gazidis has never been comfortable with that. He made the decision to step out of the spotlight soon after his appointment at Arsenal, fearing that no good would come from being in the headlines and he very\u0026nbsprarely agrees to media\u0026nbspinterviews.However, when Wenger’s end-of-season departure was announced on 20 April, it was Gazidis who faced the cameras and journalists. By doing so he put himself front and centre of the club’s new era and he has stepped into the line of fire. Gazidis desperately needs Sanllehí and Mislintat to deliver, let alone Emery. Will it work? Will the various cogs click?Gazidis was always going to be judged on The Succession and he has handled part one well enough, even if it was difficult to ease Wenger out and sell it as a mutual decision. The outpouring of love for the Frenchman came to hold sway. Now, part two looms. This is where it gets really interesting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ab40c576f100568035facd26bbb3b9bddc3077/0_14_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0530a8b4f0a890d68518971c2a6e83bc","title":"brandi chastain plaque bay area hall of fame","story":"Chastain, who won two World Cups with USA, inducted into the Bay Area Hall of Fame – but a tribute to her achievements has … provoked debateThe sculptural humiliation of football’s finest players continues apace.

The plaque in her honor has … provoked debate.Chastain, who won two World Cups with the US, diplomatically said the plaque was “nice” but admitted: “It’s not the most flattering.” The plaque captures Chastain with the pained expression of someone looking at a really bad plaque of Brandi Chastain.Ann Killion, the journalist who wrote the dedication on the plaque, was less diplomatic that Chastain. “Brandi Chastain is one of the most beautiful athletes I’ve ever covered,” Killion wrote on Twitter. “How this became her plaque is a freaking embarrassment.”After reaching a high point 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece, sporting sculpture has suffered of late. The bust of Ronaldo was subject to ridicule, and a statue of Michael Jackson – not known for his support of west London football – caused widespread bemusement when it was unveiled outside Fulham’s Craven Cottage in 2011.It is not just sculptors who have struggled to capture athletes’ likenesses. In 2015, a court artist managed to make famously handsome NFL star Tom Brady look like Gollum during his appearance in a Manhattan court.The Bay Area Hall of Fame is reportedly considering making a new version of Chastain’s plaque.

Benítez plans to watch events in Kiev on television at his long-established base on the Wirral. As the teams emerge, he may well reflect on the acute political tensions with, among others, Cristiano Ronaldo which prefaced his sacking at the Bernabéu early in 2016. But he will surely also relive that glorious night in Turkey 13 years ago, when he choreographed the “Miracle of Istanbul”.“I always say Istanbul will be the most emotional Champions League final ever because of the way we came back,” Benítez says, recalling that crazy evening when, at half-time, his side were 3-0 down to Milan, only to haul themselves level before winning on penalties.Yet, if the Merseysiders are hardly underdogs, neither are they clear favourites against Zinedine Zidane’s side. “Liverpool’s intensity can hurt you but Real Madrid have the experience and quality to match them,” says Benítez, who grew up in the Spanish capital. “It’ll be interesting. You’ll see a team with lots of passion and intensity and a lot of pressing and crossing and fast counter-attacking against opponents who can manage this kind of situation.“Jürgen Klopp has three players up front who can all score goals. Mo Salah has done really well but Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino can also score against any team. We had a good balance and we also had Stevie Gerrard who could make a difference on his own. But this current Liverpool team has three players who can do that. We had one.“Liverpool can do it. They have the quality. But sometimes in these kinds of games you pay for one mistake. It’s how you manage the pressure. Real Madrid have been managing this kind of pressure for a while and Liverpool are in a new situation, so it’s a fine balance.”Win and Klopp’s place in Anfield’s history will be assured. Confirmation that Benítez’s legacy had been cemented came during the post-match party by the Bosphorus when he rescued some invited guests struggling to bypass hotel lobby security. “A friend pointed to me and asked the security guard, ‘Do you know who he is?’”, recalls Newcastle United’s manager, laughing. When the guard shrugged indifferently, the friend declared: “This man is God.”Sheer adrenaline ensured that Benítez, virtually a teetotaller, felt no need of even a single glass of champagne that night. Surrounded by a roomful of people convinced he could walk on the Mersey, the former Real Madrid third-team midfielder partied until 6am – but two years later he saw in another, more sobering, dawn.The 2007 Champions League final in Athens featured Milan exacting revenge, beating Liverpool 2-1. “Afterwards I walked around the hotel corridors until 7am,” remembers Benítez. “They didn’t have enough rooms and my wife was sharing my room with the chief scout’s wife.“Half-time was a disaster because it was so hot. We used ice packets to reduce the players’ temperatures and there was too much sports science. I said, ‘Concentrate! We have to talk about tactics and positions.’”“We switched to three at the back and that changed everything. We scored three goals, we matched them, we had control in extra time and we’d done a lot of work on penalties.”If Jerzy Dudek’s decisive penalty save from Andriy Shevchenko was no fluke, Benítez briefly lost control during the victory parade through Merseyside. “We were on an open-top bus, the music was very loud and it was going really fast under trees with low branches,” he recalls. “We were ducking. I had to tell the driver to slow down.“Istanbul changed my life in England but at first I didn’t realise what it meant. That happened two or three days later. I went to collect my daughters from school and the other kids started singing to me. Istanbul changed everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, approximately 40,000 vehicles and 4,000 cyclists travel through the half-mile long tunnel every day.“We have only one opportunity every three months to close the tunnel and carry out all repairs, maintenance and cleaning for the next three,” says Stewart Wilson, Asset Operations Manager. “You really feel the pressure when you have a dozen jobs that all need to be carried out at once, before the tunnel reopens.”Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”“London can be rough when you’re on the streets. I’ve had some good times, I’ve had some bad times,” says Ken, one of the residents.“You’ve got to understand that to get into The Connection you’ve got to spend at least four nights on the street. They’ve got to see you sleeping out. There are people who’ve been out a lot longer than that, though. At least here you’ve got a bunk and the staff are quite helpful.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd4a8fcb4ad9fa456b8857f1ab81117dd7e8c206/0_342_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955b4fde6b70c0ca70d2864572b564a1","title":"untouchable no more india dalit bridegroom rejecting class prejudice","story":"When a student from India’s lowest caste proposed to take his marriage procession past the homes of well-to-do Hindus, uproar ensued. Yet he is now poised for a significant victoryThe dusty, nondescript road has long been a no-go area, on pain of death, for bridegrooms from the Dalit caste and their wedding processions.In July, however, on a date yet to be fixed, Sanjay Kumar Jadav, 27, will lead his parade of male relatives – called the “baraat” – down the road in Nizampur village. The group will pass the houses of upper caste Hindus who fear they will be “tainted” by his passing, to where his fiancee Sheetal lives. There, the couple will be married.Jadav is a new kind of Dalit, the lowest caste in Hinduism. Formerly known as untouchables, the Dalits are fed up with the humiliating customs and class prejudice they have endured, and are mobilising against a system that refuses to wither away. Slightly greater prosperity and higher levels of education have made the younger generation aspirational. They won’t turn away from a fight. There is a new assertiveness. Jadav is confident, educated – studying law at Aligarh Muslim University – and ready to take on any social rule that degrades or diminishes him. His position as a social worker in his village, using his education to help people of all castes apply for ID cards and welfare benefits, has reinforced his self-respect.  “I refuse to be defined by my caste. I am much more than that,” he says during a visit to New Delhi, the Indian capital. When he first announced last year that he planned to take his baraat past the exclusion zone where the upper caste, land-owning Thakurs live, outrage erupted.“The Thakurs told me no Dalit had ever done anything so outrageous. Dalit bridegrooms are expected to take the route on the outskirts of the village, avoiding the main road. We are not allowed to ride a horse. We have to walk. They said it was against tradition. I said it was time to destroy that tradition,” he says.Jadav went further and ordered himself a horse and a band. In some places, Dalit bridegrooms have been killed or beaten up by upper caste men for riding a horse, because it is seen as insubordination. Nor are they allowed to sport a moustache or wear sunglasses. Jadav took his case to the local court and then the high court in Allahabad. His petition was dismissed. The more obstacles he faced, the more determined he became. In April, by way of punishment for his persistence in the courts, the Thakurs in Nizampur cut off water to Dalit fields. “The cauliflower, cucumber, chilli, tomato and onions all died. It was a warning. Sheetal has heard the Thakurs saying that, once the wedding is over and the police have gone, they will have their revenge,” he says.In Sheetal’s village, the 50 Thakur families outnumber the 15 Dalit households. As a child, Jadav lived in a village where power was more balanced, with 400 Dalit families and about 420 Thakur.Yet he still remembers being refused drinking water by a Thakur. One day, he saw musicians performing at a festival. The main artist was playing the dholak, a cylindrical drum. Members of the high-caste audience sat on the ground while the drummer played on the raised stage.  “I decided there and then to learn to play the dholak, purely to be on a stage, to be on a higher level, while the upper castes sit below me. It took me two years, but I play it rather well now and I feel good when I look down on them,” he says, grinning. “It’s symbolic.”As an educated Dalit, he believes he must use his schooling to fight for his community’s rights. “I knew I had to get an education to fight for my rights. Now if I, as an educated person, can’t get justice for my community, then who will? “Am I not a Hindu? If I am not, let the government tell me and I will find another religion. Am I not a citizen? Don’t I have the right to walk down a public road as guaranteed by the constitution? Shouldn’t the police come out and support my right instead of telling me to back off because of tradition?” Jadav had hoped that some politicians would back his demand. However, while the ruling Bharatiya Janata party is acutely conscious of the importance of winning the votes of 200 million Dalits in next year’s election – the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has told his MPs to dine at a Dalit house once a month as a gesture of solidarity – no one in the BJP or any other party has spoken out in support of him. Nonetheless, after months of wrangling in Nizampur, a truce was finally reached last month. Prodded by the police and the media storm, the Thakurs agreed to let his wedding procession travel along the main road.  A new route has been chalked out. The band and white horse are booked. Invitations to the media have gone out. Armed police will be posted on the route. But he won’t be surprised if he sees some empty homes as he rides down the main road at the head of the procession. “Some Thakurs have said they are leaving their homes on the day because they won’t be able to bear the sight. “Isn’t that funny?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979595f7ad6493e04a942fa08689381320718dae/0_88_1797_1078/master/1797.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f701b5f7e868305a802425d5a9f602a","title":"nines review the haunt brighton","story":"The Haunt, BrightonIt’s a tiny venue for an artist with two Top 5 albums to his name, but Nines’ energy is contagious and his pace never lets upJust about visible through the forest of raised mobile phones – there’s so many in the air that you fear most of them will end up with footage not of a gig, but of other people’s mobile phones at a gig – and the on-stage crowd of guest rappers and friends filming the occasion for posterity, Nines wears a delighted grin. He appears to have missed the memo about rappers maintaining a degree of insouciant, sullen cool, something one of his guests, SL, achieves by the expedient of performing with his coat zipped up to his nose, guaranteeing a certain moody anonymity. The Haunt may be a substantially smaller venue than you might expect an artist who’s had two Top 5 albums in just over a year to be playing – tickets sold out weeks ago – but nevertheless, he looks extremely pleased to be here.To borrow the old gag Keith Richards regularly trots out on stage, perhaps he’s pleased to be anywhere, the politan police having previously proved dauntless in their efforts to stop him performing live. Gigs were cancelled due to “safety concerns”, while YouTube footage shows the rapper both being detained by officers and prevented from entering the Wireless festival to perform a guest spot with Canadian star Tory Lanez, and complaining incredulously that he’s been stopped from even attending a Mist show at the O2. If his current brief tour represents a low-key return to live performance from an artist who’s barely been on a stage in the time his career has crossed over to mainstream success, there’s nothing tentative about the show itself. The audience – young enough that the venue is checking ID and handing out wristbands to ensure no one under age gets served at the bar – are both loudly word-perfect on his oeuvre and creative in their attempts to get a better view of the action. By three songs in, someone has improved their vantage point by hanging onto an air-conditioning unit attached to the ceiling. On the stage, it’s endearingly chaotic: microphones squeal with feedback, the bass overwhelms everything else in the backing tracks, guest stars rush on and off (judging by the audience reaction to his appearance, anyone looking for the next crossover star could do worse than put money on Kennington’s Loski, whose afrobeat-flavoured Forrest Gump takes the roof off), and Nines regularly professes himself stumped as to what he’s supposed to be performing next. But through the bedlam, it’s not hard to work out why Nines has pulled ahead commercially from his road rap peers. His sound hits a sweet spot between hard-won authenticity and a contagious euphoria. You can hear a distinct US influence, not least in the smoothness of his delivery, while Liz and Oh My shift from downbeat, piano-sample melancholy to choruses made to bellow along to. His lyrics are unflinching and unrepentant in their depiction of life on the streets of north west London, but they’re really witty with it: “I went through a burglary phase, blacked out like a goth  probably been through more windows than Microsoft.” The pace never lets up over the course of an hour – all the cameo appearances make it feel like a celebratory, crowd-pleasing UK rap edition of Top of the Pops – and nor does the mood of slightly stunned delight emanating from the man at its centre: “madness, madness, madness” he mutters, as more and more audience members get on each others’ shoulders. Then it suddenly ends, leaving his DJ on the stage to politely thank the departing crowd for coming and buying so many T-shirts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05386622e25ae51d59004f6eb6ba6327f9f422ac/0_235_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=5750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43f5c883ddc95ce692c2110e81e7c20c 11500w","title":"eu trade talks australia new zealand brexit commonwealth","story":"Bloc could end up on better terms with the Commonwealth nations after Brexit than UKThe EU has leapt ahead of the UK in the pursuit of free trade deals with Australia and New Zealand after member states gave the green light for talks to start within weeks.With Theresa May insistent that leaving the EU will involve exiting the customs union and the bloc’s external commercial policy, the announcement from Brussels opens up the possibility that the EU could enjoy better terms with the two Commonwealth nations after Brexit than the UK will.New Zealand’s trade minister, David Parker, said the UK’s withdrawal did not diminish the huge potential gains for his country that would come from breaking down trade barriers with the remaining 27 member states.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, had recently spoken of “reinvigorating” the Commonwealth partnership with a host of trade deals after Brexit, labelled “empire 2.0” by sceptical Whitehall officials.But the UK will not be able to start its negotiations over future trade with New Zealand and Australia until 30 March 2019. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has vowed to complete the EU’s talks with the two countries by 31 October of that year, when his time in office expires.Brussels is eyeing up export opportunities for motor equipment, machinery, chemicals, processed foods and services. In recent months, the EU has struck deals with Canada, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam and Mexico.Last week May privately proposed to Ireland and to Donald Tusk, the European council president, her government’s concept of a “backstop” to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, which would involve the UK temporarily staying in the customs union beyond the transition period.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.It would come into force should a satisfactory free trade deal or bespoke technological solution fail to emerge that can solve the border problem. Formal negotiations in Brussels restarted on Tuesday and are scheduled to last until Thursday.However, in a sign that the Brexiters in the cabinet are no closer to accepting the idea of staying in a customs union, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was insistent on Tuesday morning that it could only be a temporary solution.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It means what it says on the tin. That temporary means not permanent. It means for a short period of time. “I’m not going to pre-empt the eventual position that we take after we have negotiated with the European Union and with Ireland ... In the same way as when you move house, a bridging loan is meant to be temporary, but whether that’s weeks or months, we don’t know precisely.”The EU has made it clear before its negotiations with Australia and New Zealand that the size of its market offers bountiful opportunities, without the need for the bloc to expose its agricultural sector to cheap imports.The mandate given to the commission for the talks, due to be formally launched in Wellington and Canberra next month, envisages special treatment for agricultural goods in order to protect European producers.In contrast, there are some voices in the Brexiter wing of the Conservative party who would like to radically liberalise the farming sector in the UK, and open it up to challenge from highly efficient antipodean agricultural exporters.Responding after EU foreign ministers announced the talks, Cecilia Malmström, the European commissioner for trade, said: “Together, we will now negotiate win-win trade deals that create new opportunities for our businesses, as well as safeguard high standards in key areas such as sustainable development. “Starting these talks between likeminded partners sends a strong signal at a time where many are taking the easy road of protectionism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86cf9f84182b37d0433b70b9c4096a497386b897/0_152_4556_2733/master/4556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48a9d9eef18ea1ee222821df71b23a96","title":"hard brexit tories pressure may customs union","story":"Johnson, Gove and Rees-Mogg deride PM’s plan and demand minimal transition periodTheresa May is facing growing pressure from leading Brexiters to press ahead with fully leaving the customs union or else put future trade deals in jeopardy and risk losing the trust of the British people. On a trade mission to South America, Boris Johnson warned the prime minister that securing the best trade deals post-Brexit was dependent on leaving the customs union in its entirety with “confidence and brio and zap and dynamism”.Amid a concerted fightback by Brexiters, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said that the backstop position, agreed by the cabinet last week in the event that the Irish border issue is not resolved speedily, must only be in place for a “short time”. Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, meanwhile, accused the government of weakness for already considering a postponement of its plans to leave the European Union and urged it to show more “backbone” in negotiations. The MP, who chairs the European Reform Group of pro-Brexit MPs, suggested he was losing faith in the prime minister’s ability to deliver, renewing speculation that he may at some point lead a challenge to her position. “In terms of these negotiations, particularly as they’re led by somebody who backed remain, trust is very important, and it’s very important that the government maintains faith with those who voted to leave,” he said in an interview with the grassroots Tory website Conservative Home.Rees-Mogg also questioned the prime minister’s commitment to leaving the EU. “I fear we’re getting to the point where you wonder if the government really wants to leave at all,” he said. “I have doubts that what she says is still fine, and what she does is not delivering on what she says and that inevitably raises concerns. She needs to bring the two together.”Asked about May’s customs partnership model, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, he was unequivocally critical: “I’m surprised the prime minister is plodding on with this not very satisfactory idea.”The foreign secretary also indicated that he felt the clock was ticking on securing a customs deal and avoiding the backstop option, despite earlier this week calling for eurosceptic Tory MPs to give May “time and space” to deliver Brexit. “The prime minister is the custodian of the plan, which is to come out of the customs union, out of the single market and to get on with it, to get on with that project with all convenient speed,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.“What people like Argentina, Peru, Chile, outward, free-trading countries, what they want to hear from us is that we are getting on with it with confidence and brio and zap and dynamism.”Johnson said that Britain should not continue levying the external tariff required by the backstop for very long. “It’s important for people to have a sense of when it’s going to happen and to be able to do it as fast as is reasonably possible,” he added.He hinted that if the backstop was invoked for any longer than a short period, he would not regard Brexit as having been delivered. “The prime minister has made it absolutely clear that we are coming out of the customs union and we’re coming out of the single market and what is entailed by those promises is very precise,” he said.A No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister has made clear we are taking back control of our laws, borders and money, and we are making good progress on that.”It comes ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s first visit to Northern Ireland since he became party leader, 20 years since voters approved the Good Friday Agreement. The two-day trip will focus on a return to power-sharing in Stormont and the prevention of a hard border after Brexit, although Corbyn has already come under pressure over his association with the Irish republican movement in the 1980s and 90s. The Labour leader, who has claimed he played a role in peace-building, has been challenged by the DUP to condemn IRA violence before the visit. He will give a speech at Queen’s University Belfast, where the IRA murdered 29-year-old law lecturer Edgar Graham in 1983, and visit the Irish border.A spokesman said: “Jeremy is looking forward to discussing the vital issues of peace, democracy and trade on this visit. We must not allow the current stalemate in Stormont or the Tories’ chaotic handling of Brexit to undermine the hard-won peace, which both communities struggled for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56592e6f502173bf75134c96c84933f5deb4a284/0_75_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0142bfa1cb2179fc4571a12851ddefae","title":"john bercow reported to commons watchdog over stupid woman claims","story":"Tory MP calls for video footage of alleged incident involving Speaker to be examinedJohn Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has been reported to its standards watchdog over allegations that he described the cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom as a “stupid woman”.The Conservative MP James Duddridge, a long-standing critic of Bercow, called for the standards commissioner to secure video and audio footage of the alleged incident in the Commons chamber last week before it was destroyed. Bercow sought to defuse the row on Monday by admitting he muttered the word “stupid” during a disagreement with the leader of the house about the timetabling of legislation, but denied insulting her personally.He was accused of having said in an aside that Leadsom was a “stupid woman”, and swearing before describing her as “useless”, prompting Downing Street to say such language would be unacceptable.In his complaint letter on Tuesday, Duddridge wrote: “I am writing in order to make a formal complaint concerning the behaviour of the Speaker, the Rt Hon John Bercow MP, on Wednesday 16th May 2018, and his comments concerning the Leader of the House, the Rt Hon Andrea Leadsom MP.“He is alleged to have called her a “f****** stupid woman” and a “liar”. He has not denied these allegations. I would ask that primary video and audio footage is examined. I would also ask that this footage is secured immediately as it may be routinely destroyed.”The demand for a fresh investigation into the latest allegations will increase pressure on the Speaker, who has previously faced calls to resign over allegations he bullied staff who worked for him.He has denied the historic claims and the Commons’ standards committee announced last week that the watchdog would not investigate them further. Duddridge, one of a large band of Conservative critics of the Speaker, suggested he should stand down in June, after originally pledging to serve nine years in the role. However, Bercow was re-elected uncontested after the 2015 and 2017 general elections, suggesting that the pledge had expired. In his letter, seen by the , Duddridge wrote: “I would like to also request a call for evidence in relation to intimidating behaviour which I and other members have witnessed repeatedly over the years.“It is essential that the Speaker steps aside from chairing and participating on all matters related to bullying.”Bercow told MPs on Monday he had been frustrated with the timetabling of legislation when he uttered the word “stupid”. He added: “It was in that context, and that context alone, that, having expressed my displeasure about the matter quite forcefully from the chair, I used the word ‘stupid’ in a muttered aside. “That adjective simply summed up how I felt about the way that that day’s business had been conducted.”It is understood that Leadsom did not complain to the parliamentary standards commissioner about the alleged comments because she did not want to jeopardise her independent complaints and grievance policy. The final proposals, which are due out before the summer recess in July, have to be signed off by the House of Commons commission, which is chaired by Bercow.The Speaker’s spokeswoman said he would not be commenting beyond what he had said in the Commons on Monday. The standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, could not be contacted for comment.

These have since been joined by a further seven cities: Beijing, Buenos Aires, Hangzhou, Koriyama, Leicester, Mérida and Xiamen.“These numbers underline the staggering challenge the world will face in the future in terms of numbers of people who are obese, or have type 2 diabetes, or both. As well as the medical challenges these people will face, the costs to countries’ health systems will be enormous,” said Dr Alan Moses of Novo Nordisk Research and Development in Søborg, Denmark. “The global prevalence of obesity and diabetes is projected to increase dramatically unless prevention of obesity is significantly intensified. Developing effective global programs to reduce obesity offer the best opportunity to slow or stabilise the unsustainable prevalence of diabetes. The first step must be the recognition of the challenge that obesity presents and the mobilisation of social service and disease prevention resources to slow the progression of these two conditions.”“Each country is different based on unique genetic, social and environmental conditions which is why there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach that will work. Inidual countries must work on the best strategy for them,” said Moses.The tide could be turned, he said, “but it will take aggressive and coordinated action to reduce obesity and inidual cities should play a key role in confronting the issues around obesity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ba09cd28532872e30ea8f03de765ca0b4d2f6e/641_174_4050_2431/master/4050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d746b995b0a5bf1828b4bf139fdc436","title":"andrew strauss andy flower england compassionate leave","story":"Andrew Strauss is to take a summer-long break from his role as director of England cricket with Andy Flower stepping into the breach as a temporary replacement.The former England captain’s wife, Ruth, was diagnosed with cancer last December and is due to begin a new treatment at the end of this week.

Perhaps this is just as well Bjorn’s September challenge will be to topple a USA team widely branded as the finest of all time.Europe’s Ryder Cup captain provided an early surprise on Tuesday, with the additions of Luke Donald and Graeme McDowell as vice-captains. Confirmation that Lee Westwood and Pádraig Harrington would serve as assistants to the Dane had been widely anticipated and duly arrived. Robert Karlsson was named as a vice-captain last year.From the captain there was some early advice for his assistants. “The one thing I always prided myself on when I went in as a vice-captain is I left my ego at the door,” Bjorn said. “We all have some sort of ego but, when you go into that week, it’s about 12 players.”For now the lofty status of the USA is emphasised by their holding of the Ryder Cup, Walker Cup, Solheim Cup, Presidents Cup, all four major championships and, thanks to Justin Thomas, the No\u0026nbsp1 position in the world rankings. “We know what we are up against,” Bjorn said. “We know they have a very strong team. They have extremely strong players. B ut, when I look at my list of 25, 30 players, it’s hard to say that Europe is not in a very good place.“That we don’t hold the major trophies, is that a coincidence? Maybe and maybe not. But that’s not really what I’m focusing on. I’m focusing on: ‘Can I see us winning with the players that we have?’ Absolutely we can because the margins in the world of golf today are so small. They have a very strong team but so do we.”Bjorn also shrugged off the status of Jim Furyk’s USA team as odds-on favourites to retain the trophy in Paris which they won rather comfortably at Hazeltine two years ago.“I don’t think I’ve gone to a Ryder Cup yet where we have not been underdogs in the eyes of the media, in the eyes of world rankings and in the eyes of everyone around,” Bjorn said. “So yes, we are probably underdogs in that way. But when it comes down to it, if you’re a favourite or you’re an underdog, you’ve got to do your job and you’ve got to do everything that you can to be prepared in the right sort of way. I don’t think the Americans will underestimate us if that’s where we’re getting to.“There is no place in the world like a European team room. There is just no place like it. It’s the best place you can be as any sportsman. It is just the best week you can have and we do it together.”Donald and McDowell were equally bullish. “Europe haven’t been beaten on European soil since 1993,” said the Northern Irishman. “I think all the attention is on the US momentum, the fact that they have got the major championships, the world No\u0026nbsp1 and all of the above. I think Europe slips nicely into its underdog role going into this one and I think we are all just really excited by the challenge.”Donald, who has been successful in all four Ryder Cup outings as a player, matched the sentiment. “We know the US team are very strong and they hold the major championships but winning a major inidually is very different from playing in Ryder Cup,” said the former world No\u0026nbsp1. “We know they are going to field a very strong team and be very confident but I think we’ve proved ourselves over the last 20 years or so that we can compete at that team level in a Ryder Cup.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d3918f3ac7f6a7f9e4f7acd7b751c51aba99bab/0_133_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dacbfe9ba37865fff1b6855f8b6422e6","title":"simon yates retains giro lead dumoulin time trial","story":"• British rider keeps pink jersey with lead of 56 seconds• Australia’s Rohan Dennis wins stage 16 time trialFive days from the finish in Rome and with three mountain stages remaining Simon Yates is within grasping distance of becoming the first Briton to win the Giro d’Italia after he defended his pink leader’s jersey in the three-week race’s longest and toughest time trial, holding the defending champion Tom Dumoulin to a more than respectable margin over the 34km between Trento and Rovereto.To have any hope of overall victory, the Dutchman needed to wrestle the pink jersey from Yates’s slender shoulders, even if only by a few seconds, but instead the world champion fared slightly worse than might have been predicted – finishing only third on the stage behind the Australian Rohan Dennis – which meant Yates had to improve only slightly on what was expected in order to take a significant stride towards final victory.Dumoulin closed from 2min 11sec behind Yates to 56sec but he faces an uphill task to repeat his victory of 2017. While Thursday’s uphill finish is the kind of nagging climb that suits him Friday and Saturday have repeated climbs that will favour Yates’s climbing strength. Moreover Dumoulin’s Sunweb team do not seem to have enough climbing strength to put Yates’s Mitchelton-Scott team under pressure.Amid his obvious pleasure at retaining the pink jersey for the 10th day, Yates said his tactical plan would change. Having focused on attacking to gain time to create a cushion for Tuesday’s stage, he can now ride more conservatively. “It changes my tactics for the next few days. Unfortunately for the fans it means I can be a lot more defensive, all the way to Rome. Sorry guys.” As he noted, his stage win on Sunday, where he gained 47sec on Dumoulin, was critical in giving him the lead he now enjoys.Over a largely flat course through the vineyards that line the valley of the river Adige – and alongside the motorway that runs south out of Trento, this was far from the “kicking” predicted by Yates’s directeur sportif, Matt White, but it was by no means a straightforward process for the Briton. He never looked entirely comfortable on his time-trial bike, in stark contrast to Dumoulin’s smooth, unflustered style.The risk Yates ran, as all climbers do in this kind of stage, were exemplified by the fortunes of Thibaut Pinot, a past winner of the French national time trial title and a contender for the podium in this Giro until this stage. Here, a catastrophic performance meant he dropped to fifth overall.The top three on the stage were specialists, led by Dennis, who had targeted the opening time trial in Jersusalem, where he finished second to Dumoulin, although that ride enabled him to snatch the pink jersey in the opening week. It is a welcome result for the BMC team, which is searching for a new sponsor after the death of its founder and long-time backer Andy Rihs, and it hoisted him to sixth overall.The former world champion Tony Martin finished ahead of Dumoulin in second, while Chris Froome’s fourth place on the stage suggests he can still at least target third place, although he has been anything but consistent over the past two and a half weeks. Just behind Froome the Italian national champion, Fabio Aru, created the one major shock with fifth place – surprising for a rider who had looked close to quitting the race on Sunday – while the Essex rider Alex Dowsett posted a respectable seventh.Yates has now opened a healthy gap over the other riders pushing for victory behind Dumoulin: Pozzovivo has slipped to 3min 11sec, Froome is at almost 4min, just ahead of Pinot, which again gives grounds for optimistim.“I’ve got a bigger gap to the guys behind me,” Yates said. “It’s not just Tom he’s at a minute. The guys behind him are at a good gap. There are still some hard days to come. I have to hope I have no bad luck and no bad days.”On Wednesday the race heads through the Italian lake country for a flat finish in Iseo, which will be the final chance for breakaway specialists to target a stage win. That is followed by three mountain-top finishes in succession. Friday and Saturday’s stages to Monte Jafferau and Cervinia look particularly tough, although on paper Yates’s climbing skills should enable him to defend or extend his lead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

The travel guide publisher has attempted to tackle the issue of overtourism in its annual holiday hotlist, by highlighting lesser-visited destinations across the continent.Dundee is Scotland’s fourth largest city and is sixth on Lonely Planet’s Best in Europe 2018 list. It earned the spot for its “head-turning” urban redevelopment, including the transformation of its historic waterfront and the opening of a new branch of the V\u0026ampA this September .Lonely Planet describes it as an “exciting moment” for a city that has often been overlooked by visitors to Scotland, and praised its “nationally important museums and attractions” and “dynamic, creative spirit”.The number one spot went to Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The region was picked out as an alternative to Tuscany, Campania and Veneto, and for its emergence as one of the best foodie spots in the country. Emilia-Romagna is the home of ragù, Parma ham, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese. Recently Bologna, the regional capital, saw the opening of the world’s largest culinary theme park, Fico Eataly, where visitors can sample all manner of local cuisine. Other picks on the list included the wild beaches, mountains and “enchanted” villages of Cantabria, Spain (a far cry from the overcrowded attractions of Barcelona and the Costa del Sol) and Kosovo, which boasts “dramatic hiking trails, Ottoman-era history and a growing cultural scene”. “There is growing concern over the increase in tourism to popular European destinations, particularly over the busy summer months, so with this list we wanted to show that there are a wealth of incredible alternatives to discover across Europe,” said Lonely Planet editorial director, Tom Hall.

No wonder Oprah raves about itA few years ago my husband and I rented a bungalow in the Californian mission town of San Luis Obispo. We lived next to a firefighter and an octogenarian cowboy named Webb. There were annual block parties, potluck suppers, a coveted tomato growing prize (the champion donning a flowing silk cape, parading around our cul-de-sac). Saturday nights at the Sunset Drive-In, one of the few remaining outdoor cinemas in California, we swung our legs from our car boot, wrapped in blankets, radio tuned in for the movie. On the giant screen a cola bottle sang and danced with a tub of popcorn. We couldn’t believe our luck.But, as the song goes, nothing ever lasts forever. When word got out we were moving, Webb came by with a bottle of moonshine. “Goddamn,” he said, leaning against his farm truck, shaking his head. “Los Angeles?” He had a demonic view of big city life. This was a bad business. Webb gazed into the middle distance in the direction of his cattle ranch. Why in the world, he pondered, would anyone be stupid enough to leave San Luis? It was a good question. San Luis Obispo (SLO) is often used as a refuelling point for motorists cruising up and down scenic Highway 1, which runs along California’s Pacific coastline, and is home to the world’s first motel, originally called the Milestone Mo-Tel. Perhaps no surprise, then, that most visitors tend to just stretch their legs or stay a night at the uber-kitsch Madonna Inn on the outskirts before motoring on. This is a crying shame because this dreamy college town, once named the happiest place in America by Oprah Winfrey, should be a destination all of its own.On a warm autumn morning, I dodge Friday traffic and catch the early train from LA to revisit old friends. As we draw close the landscape is mesmeric: golden hills, vineyards, citrus groves, craggy peaks. The leisurely speed of the train, which teeters along the precipitous Californian coastline before arcing inland towards San Luis, feels fitting to the relaxed pace of life in SLO, a town with a laid- back attitude. Nothing much seems to have changed. In Scout Coffee, locals – in no hurry to get to work – sun themselves in the window of the airy cafe. Like me, the owners, Sara and Jon Peterson, moved to the area on a whim. “I’m from the midwest,” Sara tells me. “I remember stopping through here when I was in college and we got a sandwich from this tiny health food store which blew my mind.” She gestures towards the leafy avenue of shops. “I thought it was the coolest town.”Round the corner on the main drag, Higuera Street, freshmen from California Polytechnic State University on the edge of town are having a guided tour. The street is wide and shady, the ficus trees knitting into a canopy overhead. One student ducks down a passage to make his mark on SLO’s most baffling attraction, Bubblegum Alley, a walkway so stuccoed with gum it’s almost Pollock-esque. By nightfall, inhibitions gone, most of the freshers will end up at SLO Brew, the largest music venue in town which doubles as a brewery. As locals we used to roll our eyes at the students’ drunken antics – a neighbour found one asleep on her sofa – but the truth is they gave us something to grumble about.SLO Brew has a number of large, loft-like suites for rent, my home for the night. Each plush apartment comes furnished with a ukulele and, mercifully, a jar of complementary earplugs. Which is lucky because I’ve persuaded two friends to join me on a pre-dawn hike up nearby Madonna Mountain (the sort of early bird, outdoor activity that SLO natives pride themselves on). At 5.30am we’re not the first to hit the trail. Joggers’ torches flicker on the hillside ahead of us as we corkscrew 1,300 feet to the top, scrambling the last few meters to the boulder tipped peak just as the sun rises. The town below is cupped by the surrounding hills, flaxen in autumn, turning a lush emerald in late winter, almost implausibly green. My favourite time of year is spring when Californian wild flowers bloom, spray-painting the fields neon orange and pink. A herd of cattle grazing on the far hillside is a reminder that this is cowboy country. (The annual Mid State Fair in nearby Paso Robles hosts a sweltering 12-day hoedown in July, complete with turkey racing, rodeo, corn dogs, tractor pulling and cow milking demos.)From the summit I can see at least two of the Nine Sisters chain of volcanic mountains and hills. It’s thanks in part to these long-extinct volcanoes that produce grown around San Luis Obispo is so good. The first time I visited SLO’s Thursday evening market, my husband and I sat on the pavement and devoured an entire punnet of strawberries shiny as patent leather. The weekly event feels more like a street party. Smoke billows above racks of BBQ ribs chefs yell orders and rattle their utensils. Tri-tip, a sirloin cut, is the local speciality but I love the grilled artichoke, which comes with a pot of warm garlicky butter.Down from the mountain I grab a breakfast burrito at vegetarian café Linnaea’s, excellent fuel for some window shopping. San Luis Obispo is not known for high- end fashion, it’s more a shorts and T-shirt kind of place, but it has a few gems. Design store, Len Collective, has a tempting selection of textiles and chic clothing. Another favourite is Ruby Rose with its secondhand treasures: vintage cotton smocks, cowboy boots and mid-century furniture. The rainbow striped building next door is the HQ of Pipsticks, a sticker emporium, whose industrial storefront makes stationary feel hip. In the summer months, when students depart and temperatures rise, SLO has a languorous feel. Locals and tourists alike head to the beach. Nearby Morro Bay has some excellent waves but from May to October the star attractions are humpback whales. Boat tours from the harbour get you surprisingly close (we once had a humpback circling our boat). Just south of SLO, Avila Beach has slightly warmer water and mellower waves for swimming, though the real draw is the Olde Port Fish Market. In a shed at the far end of Port San Luis Pier, fishmongers cook up fresh crab while you wait. Best of all, beneath the pier are piles of snoozing sea lions, close enough to see their whiskers twitching. Before I catch my train home I take one last stroll through the Mission plaza, blinding white in the late-afternoon sunshine, past City Hall and the candy-striped front of Frank’s Famous Hot Dog’s, towards my old neighbourhood. Home from feeding his cows, Webb pulls up his truck. “Look what the cat dragged in. Get over here.” He gives me a long, vice-like hug. There is an exchange of news: babies born, heifers sold, the price of a tank of petrol. Just over the hill cars glide along Highway 1 and disappear into a golden horizon. It’s no surprise that America, a nation built on migration, has such love for the open road. But leaning against Webb’s bonnet, chewing the fat, I have to wonder, what’s the big hurry?• Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner service runs daily from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo (5 ½ hours, $42 each way) "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a82bb1636b503df07cf0efca12dfa91b2c0e23/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ca0a156412662fb23fcd28d2c87cf1","title":"manchester the night of the bomb review","story":"In a devastating documentary, reminiscences from young Ariana Grande fans are followed by harrowing footage of the explosion, the ensuing confusion and a portrait of the bomber himselfIt is a simple opening, but devastatingly poignant in context: teenage girls talking about getting ready to go to a concert. “I wanted something off the shoulder,” says one. “Like girly, but not girly. Like Ariana Grande.” It is poignant because, even now, these teenagers are able to recapture that sense of anticipation. It is devastating because you know what is coming next.In all, 14,000 people attended Grande’s show at the Manchester Arena on 22 May last year. Manchester: The Night of the Bomb (BBC Two) recounts the events leading up to, and after, the explosion in the foyer that killed 23 people and wounded more than 500. It is a documentary you can watch only with your heart in your throat.Grande performed her last number and walked off stage shortly before 10.30pm, perplexing a lot of her young fans. “It was the Dangerous Woman tour and she hadn’t sung Dangerous Woman,” says Acacia Seward, 12. By the time Grande came out and did the song as an encore, a good proportion of the audience were already making their way through the foyer.The device went off at 10.31pm, while the bomber stood among parents waiting to collect their children. The moment of the explosion is recalled by survivors in a litany of horrifying details. People were lifted off their feet. The doors blew open, then shut themselves. The foyer was filled with a bright white light – “Like snow coming towards you” – and then darkness as it was suffused with smoke. Nuts and bolts from the device ricocheted, making a sound like machine-gun fire. For some victims, the immediate aftermath was eerily silent: their eardrums had been perforated. There was blood everywhere and people struggled to grasp the\u0026nbspextent of their injuries. “I saw my legs were on fire and then I was unconscious,” says Eve Senior, 15.A countdown clock (reminiscent of the one Grande employed as her big entrance approached) winds back to the moment of the explosion for another perspective. Phone footage recorded the panic inside the auditorium, where there was a stampede of people trying to get out\u0026nbsp– running towards the carnage by the exits. In all the\u0026nbspconfusion, rumours about gunmen spread.Winding back again, the documentary adopts the point of view of the emergency services. Four transport police were on duty at Victoria railway station, connected to the arena by a footbridge. They ran toward the scene, in the opposite direction of the fleeing crowds. “If you can imagine hell,” says PC Steve Corke, “times it by a million”.Because of the possibility of secondary devices – there were abandoned bags everywhere – arriving ambulance crews were kept back, even as members of the public ran toward the danger to help. With no proper medical equipment on the scene, the flow of blood was stemmed with Grande T-shirts. Victims had to be ferried to the train station to get medical attention. The safety protocols in place were much criticised after the fact, but the documentary obliges you to experience the confusion, the agonising and frustration over decisions taken, for better or worse, on\u0026nbspthe night.The other main strand of the film concerns the 23rd fatality: 22-year-old Salman Abedi, sliced in two by his own bomb. Born and bred in Manchester, Abedi had returned to the city four days before on a flight from Libya. His parents, who fled Libya during the Gaddafi regime, had recently gone back there to live. A difficult and sometimes violent student, Abedi was fighting on the front line in Libya’s civil war by the age of 17. In the months before the attack, he was living alone in the family home in Manchester. His exact motivations remain opaque, but police say he would have been incapable of making the bomb he used without close guidance. Abedi does not qualify as a victim alongside those he killed, injured and traumatised that night, but he is bound up in the tragedy all the same.Manchester: The Night of the Bomb provides a gruelling evocation of that tragedy. Some of it – such as the recorded announcement still blaring out the words “Attention: due to an incident, it is necessary to evacuate the area” long after the building had been emptied of anyone who could walk – is positively haunting. But it is also, in the end, inspiring, thanks to the determination of those present to tell their stories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d657eb2e1cfd93708bdf08574d95dd0f5c10ac/80_246_5246_3146/master/5246.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0195a8d7b960322c70887995112982a8","title":"mike pompeo iran assassination operations europe","story":"The statement bewildered security experts and Iranian exiles, who say they are not aware of any evidence for the allegationMike Pompeo’s claim that the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard is carrying out “assassination operations in the heart of Europe” has bewildered security experts and Iranian exiles, who say they are not aware of any evidence for the allegation.The new US secretary of state referred to the alleged assassinations in his first major speech on Monday, but devoted just a single line to it amid a litany of criticisms of Iranian behaviour, giving no further details. “Today, the Iranian Quds Force conducts covert assassination operations in the heart of Europe,” Pompeo said, referring to the external operations arm of the Islamic revolutionary guards corps (IRGC).Asked about Pompeo’s statement, the state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said: “He has information and access to information that I do not. I am not able to comment on that in particular but I can tell the secretary has assured me that there is a basis for that point in his speech and he stands firmly behind that.”US diplomats specialising in Iran were taken by surprise by Pompeo’s allegations.There have been no recent killings in Europe officially attributed to the Iranian state. Iran’s last prime minister under the Shah, Shapour Bakhtiar, was assassinated in France in 1991, and four Iranian Kurdish dissidents were gunned down in a Greek restaurant called Mykonos in Berlin the following year.The court in the Mykonos case issued an international arrest warrant in 1997 for Iran’s then intelligence minister, Hojjat al-Islam Ali Fallahian, but Tehran denied involvement.The 2012 bombing of a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Burgas, Bulgaria, was blamed by the Bulgarian government on the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, widely viewed as a Iranian client force.Pompeo’s remarks, however, appeared to refer to current rather than past events and singled out the Quds force.The most recent killing of an Iranian dissident took place in The Hague in November last year, when a gunman shot Ahmad Mola Nissi, the leader of an Iranian Arab separatist group in the oil-rich Khuzistan province.The armed wing of Nissi’s movement had claimed responsibility for several attacks in Iran including the deaths of two IRGC guardsmen in January 2017. Nissi’s daughter said in an interview last year that her father’s death was reminiscent of Iranian state killings in 1990s.“Europe seems safe, but be careful. The conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran is not confined to the Middle East. It is spreading into Europe,” Hawra Nissi told Reuters. “The family is open to all scenarios. Iran is a prime suspect, but not the only suspect.”However, the Dutch investigation into the killing has not publicly blamed the IRGC. If Pompeo was referring to the Nissi murder, he was disclosing formerly classified information. Iraj Mesdaghi, a Sweden-based Iranian political activist who spent a decade in jail in Iran from 1981 to 1991, questioned Pompeo’s claim. “It’s unlikely to be true,” said Mesdaghi, a researcher on human rights abuses in Iran who has closely monitored IRGC activities in Europe.  “There is no evidence to back the claim that currently they are carrying out such operations in Europe.” Mesdaghi said the IRGC or Quds Force have not been officially blamed for any assassinations in Europe since the Mykonos trial. Mesdaghi said Iran is suspected to have carried out at least a couple more such attacks since Mykonos, such as the killing near Paris of the former cabinet member Reza Mazlouman. But he said such assassinations appeared to have stopped after the end of Mykonos trial in 1997. “Europe made it clear after Mykonos that such assassinations are a red line for the continent,” he said. Mesdaghi said no links have been established so far to tie Iran to Nissi’s death. “It would be very unusual for Iran to have carried out his killing given the relationship they have with Europe now and the fact that Nissi was not influential, nor important enough,” he said.Shashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London said: “Iran conducted a wave of assassinations across Europe in the 1990s, and the Iran-backed militant group Hizbullah is widely thought to have been responsible for the Burgas attack in 2012 as retaliation for Israeli targeting of Iranian nuclear scientists.”But, as for the Nissi killing, Joshi said: “There is no public evidence to weigh these claims and European officials have been silent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5670a18764d6ce8b4cce16a876fd787e9d5dbeab/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c806364dda89e6eef403a50de6026e61","title":"sidney kilmartin maine mailed cyanide suicidal andrew denton hull","story":"Sidney Kilmartin was charged with mailing a suicidal man in Hull cyanide after he threatened to report Kilmartin for fraudA federal judge in New England sentenced a man to 25 years in prison on Tuesday for mailing a fatal dose of cyanide to a suicidal British man, accusing the defendant of an “appalling moral vacuum”.Judge John Woodcock’s ruling in US district court in Portland, Maine, came four years after Sidney Kilmartin was arrested for mailing the poison to Andrew Denton of Hull, in the UK.Kilmartin, 56, of Windham, Maine, was found guilty in 2016 of mailing injurious articles resulting in death, and witness-tampering, in a case that frequently was delayed in court. His lawyer, Bruce Merrill, of Portland, said he would appeal both the conviction and the sentence. Kilmartin had pleaded not guilty.Investigators charged Kilmartin with advertising and mailing a substance he said was cyanide to several suicidal people. It was really Epsom salt. But in one vital case, investigators found Kilmartin had sent the real thing to Denton, 49, after he had threatened to report the fraud – and Denton used it to kill himself.Woodcock expressed sympathy for Kilmartin, who himself has attempted suicide in the past, once overdosing on antipsychotic medication and drinking antifreeze.But the judge added that Kilmartin’s fraud and his role in Denton’s death represented an “appalling moral vacuum” worthy of stiff punishment.“Not merely illegal they were perpetrated in a moral black hole,” Woodcock said. “Just an unimaginable moral black well that these actions took place in.”Kilmartin, who wore an orange prison jumpsuit and spoke only to address the judge, faced a maximum sentence of life in prison.Kilmartin and Denton were “kindred spirits” who were very ill and depressed, and related to each other because they were both suicidal, Merrill said on Tuesday. He said the two communicated about the most effective way to take the potassium cyanide, a lethal, colorless salt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965cfcbc7a7b05a88f7366e887b8178c57395c0e/0_144_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71b4a3639fc13cbacd02360c5832c359","title":"south africa kidnappers ransom demand bitcoin","story":"Abductors of boy, 13, left note demanding £92,000 worth of cryptocurrency for his releaseA gang that kidnapped a South African teenager from a playground at the weekend have demanded a ransom in bitcoin worth about $123,000, police have said.The 13-year-old boy was taken in the town of Witbank in the eastern province of Mpumalanga while he was playing with two friends near his home. Witnesses said a Toyota Corolla pulled up nearby and the teenager was dragged in and driven away.“We are investigating a case of kidnapping that happened on Sunday in Witbank. There was a demand that was made that the parents should deposit cash in bitcoins,” the police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said on Tuesday. Local media said the ransom note was left at the scene.Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, “cryptocurrency” – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption –\u0026nbspor regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.“This is a kidnapping … We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child’s safe release – non-negotiable,” the note reportedly read. The first deadline for payment of part of the ransom passed on Monday night. In the note, the kidnappers threatened to kill the boy if their demands were not met.

The latest case appears to be the first ransom demand in made for a cryptocurrency in the country.In December 2017, an employee at a cryptocurrency exchange in Ukraine was released by kidnappers after a ransom of more than $1m worth of bitcoins was paid.

The financier, who supports the introduction of sanctions against Russians accused of violating human rights, added that “top Putin oligarchs should be on that list”.The campaigner and the CEO of the investment fund Hermitage Capital Management did not name oligarchs he believed should be targeted.He said similar action in the US “definitely affected the psychology of Putin, and if the British government were to do anything less it would tell Russia it can keep killing people on British soil. The US has shown the way.”The sanctions and anti-money laundering bill, which receives royal assent on Wednesday, contains a Magnitsky amendment, named after a whistleblower who died in custody in Moscow in 2009. It gives the UK the power to target iniduals accused of “gross human rights violations” and seize their assets, raising the prospect of the British government acting shortly thereafter.John Penrose, a Conservative backbencher and former minister, also said it was time for the UK to follow the US lead. “Given the extensive intelligence sharing and security co-operation between Britain and USA, if we don’t announce our own sanctions pretty soon it will look extremely odd. The UK needs to publish a British equivalent of the US’s list right now.”The original Magnitsky list was introduced in the US under Obama, and enabled it to withhold visas and freeze the assets of iniduals named. It originally cited dozens of iniduals involved in the case of Sergei Magnitsky but has since been expanded to encompass other countries and many more iniduals, who are prevented from doing business with US companies or citizens.Britain is one of the last countries to introduce a similar approach, but at the beginning of May the Conservatives and Labour agreed to support a Magnitsky amendment in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The passage of the amendment was described by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, as “an important moment” that would “allow UK to act against those responsible for serious offences worldwide”.On Monday, Johnson hinted that UK action could come soon and he was examining the approach taken by the Trump administration: “The truth is actually that I think the effect of some of those sanctions, particularly on some iniduals, has been very marked and I’ve noted that, but we have our own systems and our own approach and we have to do it in accordance with the law and accordance with the evidence.”The US version of the legislation sanctioned aluminium billionaire Oleg Deripaska. Since the US sanctions were announced Deripaska has said that he is prepared to give up a majority stake in EN+, a London listed holding company for his metals interests. The oligarch has also stepped down from the board of the company, whose share price tumbled after the Trump administration said it would target him.In an unrelated hearing at the high court earlier in May, Deripaska denied the “alleged basis for the imposition of sanctions against me”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502274.1526843650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in muff we pray for the president in culmore the queen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArchdeacon Robert Miller at Muff Church of Ireland in Co Donegal. Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503528.1526934314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"westminster committee urges may to take more active role in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May was urged by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster to take a more active role in Northern Ireland’s affairs until devolved institutions there are restored.  Photograph: EPAThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster has called on Theresa May’s government to take a more active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland until the devolved institutions there are restored.In a report, Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland – Dealing with the Deficit, to be published on Tuesday, the committee also urges an early return to talks to restore the Executive and Assembly.“Karen Bradley is right to make restoring power-sharing devolved government in Stormont her first priority. However, while the political impasse continues the list of policy obstructions and project delays grows and becomes more serious,” committee chair Andrew Murrison said.“We believe the Secretary of State is correct to insist that any decisions from Westminster align with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Helpfully, some GFA-compliant guidance already exists. For example, the Hart Report makes policy recommendations that were broadly welcomed across the community.“Elsewhere, the Secretary of State will need to develop stronger ways of engagement and consider new measures to secure adequate scrutiny. Our recommendations include a committee system at Stormont as a temporary expedient pending restoration of the Executive.”Some members of the committee, including Labour’s Kate Hoey and the DUP’s Ian Paisley, have criticised the way the Belfast Agreement operates and the report calls for a consultation between London, Dublin and Belfast on how it might be improved. The report suggests that such a consultation should review how the power-sharing system works and if and how it should be changed.“The Good Friday Agreement has had a transformative effect on Northern Ireland. However, its institutions have collapsed and even if restarted tomorrow would likely remain fragile,” Dr Murrison said.“With the involvement and consent of the whole community in Northern Ireland, we have to consider if they can be more robust and how improvements can be made, as envisaged in the agreement itself. We must investigate every avenue to secure long-term stable government. For political stalemate to become the new normal is unthinkable and unacceptable.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year. Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

They also see and give consent to any post where there are in the picture.But users replied saying that it was morally wrong and as children they were not able to give consent or understand what it meant. A post of Mrs Hooper and her twin daughters on InstagramUser MarshaBradyo added: Selling children doesn’t just mean using them in an ad. It’s also using them as content to the extent that it brings in £.On Monday , a week after engaging in the discussion, Mrs Hooper deactivated her social media site.Nearly 470,000 people followed her Instagram page, which was full of stories of family life and the pitfalls of parenting her daughters Anya, Marnie, Ottilie and Delilah, aged between two and 10. Her husband Simon, who posts under the name  “Father of Daughters” and has almost 850,0000 followers on Instagram, also regularly posts images of the family including advertising. The couple, who run a limited company together, have repeatedly claimed that talking openly they are talking openly about their failings as it important as it helps the enormous number of fellow parents who follow them. But as they declare on their posts, they are actually partnered with a number of brands including Pampers and Dorset Cereals and their Instagram show that it also allows them to live a glamorous lifestyle. Clemmie and Simon Hooper chronicle their lives on social mediaPhotographs of a family holiday in Florida are labelled as a partnership with Visit Florida, which Mrs Hooper described as a work trip in an interview, whilst the couple spent time in Madagascar in October. Their social media profiles have also acted as a springboard for the couple to write three books between them about pregnancy and parenting. Mr Hooper,  a 35-year-old management consultant, is taking part in a social experiment whereby Renault have placed a camera in his car for a year. Mr Hooper then posts videos of family trips - tagged as being a paid partnership with Renault UK - including one in which he says that it is really the only place he can had one on one time with his daughters. Recent Mumsnet posts from Mrs Hooper reveal that it is not just on blogs where the ethics of posting images of their children are discussed as a photographs of one of her daughters on a potty was one I wasn’t happy with him posting I felt it crossed the line, she revealed. When asked why she did not demand he remove it she replied: The reason I felt it wasn’t wise to have it taken down was I felt it would only anger people and fuel more threads so I remained silent and never mentioned it until now. Those close to the midwife, who works on a ward one day a week, say that the de-activation of her Instagram account is likely to only be temporary as she takes a few days breather from online rows. The midwife had also become embroiled in accusations of bullying on her page after her followers repeatedly criticised someone who accused her of hypocrisy. Despite posts suggesting that she had been reported for breaches of the Nursing and Midwifery Council\u0027s social media rules, her employer Kings College Hospital said that it had received no such complaint. Mrs Moody refused to comment on why she had suspended her account. She has faced criticism for featuring her children in her posts for a number of years and has repeatedly defended her decision. Her followers have commented on Mr Hooper\u0027s account asking her to ignore the bullying and come back, with one commenting: People still can\u0027t handle someone being a mother and a professional, and a person in their own right.Justine Roberts, CEO and founder of Mumsnet, said: Many Instagram stars are in our own Influencers Network, we consider them to be Mumsnetters and value them highly.We know that some have taken the feedback on board the criticism of a lack of clarity when it comes to labelling sponsored posts seems to have led to some Instamums being more transparent about sponsorship and advertising, which is great and much appreciated by mums.Duke and Duchess of Sussex make first appearance as a married couple at Prince Charles\u0026#39 70th birthday partyMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesInside the royal wedding evening receptionNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance - and joy - of the dayCambridge professor accused of being FBI \u0026#39source\u0026#39 in Trump Russia probe was \u0026#39put up for US ambassadorship\u0026#39Judge in New York orders 30-year-old man to leave home after parents take legal action to evict himElderly couple offer reward for car missing in Cheltenham after forgetting where they parked itThe Split, episode 5 recap: this show is chock full of infidelity, but could we still get a happy ending next week?Britain should hold talks with the Taliban to bring peace to Afghanistan, Gavin Williamson saysSuperbugs could render even the most routine procedures deadly, warns chief medical officerComment: By 2050 one person will die every three seconds if we don\u0026#39t tackle antibiotic resistanceYoungest soldier sent to Iraq killed himself after horrors of war left him feeling \u0026#39useless\u0026#39, inquest hearsDonald Trump \u0026#39ignores security advice\u0026#39 for the phone he tweets fromBrussels breaking Brexit bill promises by freezing UK out of Galileo satellite programme Belarus calls LGBT relationships \u0026#39fake\u0026#39 in row with UK embassy over rainbow flagHarry and William have pipped the Queen in list of \u0026#39hardest-working\u0026#39 RoyalsComment: Gavin Williamson looks like a giggly schoolboy – but there’s a reason Theresa May likes himWho is Stefan Halper, the Cambridge professor accused of being an FBI \u0026#39source\u0026#39 in Trump Russia investigation?

harry meghan markle make first appearance married couple","story":"The Duke of Sussex has paid tribute to his father, the Prince of Wales, in an affectionate speech in which he teased him about royal life.The Duke told a garden party full of charity guests that they may view the Prince’s enthusiastic handwritten letters with “joy and perhaps trepidation”, ribbing him for celebrating his birthday six months early with the words: “How very Royal!”Wearing a cream dress from British label Goat and Philip Treacey hat, the Duchess appeared to have conformed quickly to the style of Royal women, choosing long sleeves and nude tights for a look noticeably more demure than before her wedding day.Joining her first public engagement as a member of the Royal family, she appeared to get on famously with the Duchess of Cornwall, both failing to suppress their laughter when the Duke’s speech was interrupted by a bee.Prince Charles, with wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwal, and the Duchess of SussexLosing his place half way through, the Duke had waved his hand to swat it away from his ear, telling the crowd: “That bee really got me.”The Duke and Duchess attended their first engagement since the wedding on Saturday to support the Prince at a Buckingham Palace garden party to celebrate his charity work ahead of his 70th birthday.Prince Charles\u0026#039s 70th birthday party pictures: Duke and Duchess of Sussex among the guestsPerhaps mindful of overshadowing him, the couple posed for photographs and spoke to four small groups of people before making a quiet exit.As people congratulated them on their wedding, both politely said “thank you” before moving the conversation on to talk about guests’ charity work.One woman, Sophie Rogers, 26, gave the Duchess what appears to be her first gift as Her Royal Highness: a handmade crystal necklace from her own studio, High Vibe Designs.Ms Rogers had received a grant from The Prince’s Trust two years ago, going on to start her own successful business.“Oh how sweet, thank you,” said the Duchess. “I was just admiring your necklace, it’s beautiful.”Addressing his “Pa” in the only speech of the afternoon, the Duke said: “It really is amazing to see so many of you here today for this family celebration.“I say ‘family’ because this is a chance for us to honour The Prince of Wales\u0027s work over the last forty plus years, with all of his charities, patronages and military associations – and, as you all know, my father views all of your organisations like an extended family.”Telling his father he had been struck by the “long list” of guests invited, and the range of charities the Prince had worked with, he asked 6,000 assembled guests:“Who amongst you has not known the joy, and perhaps trepidation at receiving a handwritten note in response to some news shared from your organisation, urging you on and asking for more to be done to address this issue or that?Guests pose for a photograph as they attend The Prince of Wales\u0026#39 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration held at Buckingham Palace “Who has not come away from a meeting with my father, their head spinning with a dozen new ideas which he wants to get underway urgently, having met a group of people or read something that has fired his imagination and started the flow of ideas.“His enthusiasm and energy are truly infectious it has certainly inspired William and I to get involved in issues we care passionately about and to do whatever we can to make a difference.“In fact, many of the issues William and I now work on are subjects we were introduced to by our father growing up.“His passion and dedication are remarkable and seeing so many of you here today, I cannot fail but to be in awe of the drive he has had for so many years, to contribute to the enrichment of society both in this country and around the world.”The Duke of Sussex\u0026#39s speech was interrupted by a beeAcknowledging the Prince’s instructions that the party should “not be about him”, the Duke added: “So, Pa, while I know that you\u0027ve asked that today not be about you, you must forgive me if I don’t listen to you – much like when I was younger – and instead, I ask everyone here to say a huge thank you to you, for your incredible work over nearly 50 years.“Work that has given self-confidence and opportunity to thousands of young people who might not have had the best start in life Or to champion causes like climate change long before almost anyone else was talking about it and above all, for your vision and ability to bring people together to make change happen.“You have inspired William and I, and looking out here today, it is clear to see that we are not alone.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex leave the garden party“You have created an incredible body of work that has, and will continue to make such a huge difference to so many people\u0027s lives both here and around the world.“With that, Ladies and Gentlemen, please can I ask you to join me in wishing The Prince of Wales a very Happy Birthday – six months ahead of his 70th.“How very Royal.”After finishing the speech, father and son embraced with a kiss on both cheeks, before the four members of the Royal family walked down the steps of Buckingham Palace into the garden to pose for a photograph with charity leaders.The two Duchesses appeared to get on famously, making eye contact and laughing as they were arranged in suitably smart fashion for a photograph.Charles, Camilla, Meghan and Harry pose for a photographWhen Meghan embarked on meeting some charity representatives, she extended her hand to shake before most had a chance to curtsey to her in her new position as HRH.“I knew I was going to curtsey by she shook my hand,” said Diana Langson, from 2nd

We can be positive and we can stand together’People in Manchester have gathered at events across the city to mark the first anniversary of the arena bombing that left 22 people dead and hundreds injured.Over a thousand attended a service in bright sunshine outside Manchester Cathedral which began with a minute’s silence that was observed across the country.Elsewhere, people laid bouquets of flowers in St Ann’s Square and others left hand-written notes on Japanese maple trees that have been planted to form a “Trees of Hope” trail through Manchester.Pop star Ariana Grande, who had finished a performance at the arena when the bomb was detonated, shared a message of hope, telling survivors and families of victims she was “thinking of you all today and every day”.“I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day,” she said in a tweet in which she also included a bee – the civic symbol of Manchester.Members of the public observe a minute’s silence in Cathedral Gardens (PA)Outside the cathedral a choir sang “Amazing Grace” and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”, and Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and humanist leaders all addressed the congregation. On the altar stood 22 lit candles, made from the wax of thousands of candles left in the city’s St Ann’s Square in the days after the attack. Prince William and Theresa May joined survivors and emergency workers who responded to the attack for the service.William read a passage from the Bible’s book of Corinthians, ending: “Faith, hope and love abide, these three but the greatest of these is love.” ‘You will never be forgotten’, reads a message left among the flowers (Jessica Morgan)A large screen showed photographs and the names of those killed. Many struggled to keep themselves from sobbing, and small groups of people held each other as they cried when specific names and faces came up on the large display.People leaving the service said they thought it was a “perfect” tribute, and that they were “proud of our city”.Mother and daughter Susan and Emma Wardley had both known victim Martyn Hett for over 10 years through the LGBT+ community. They said the attack had become “part of Manchester’s history”.Susan told The Independent: “I feel we have to remember the people that died as a mark of respect. We have to remember those who were injured, who helped and saw some horrific sights. We need never to let it go because it’s part of Manchester’s history. It happened but we can’t change that. We can be positive and we can stand together.”Emma added: “It’s amazing to know we have so much support from other people. But what saddens me so much is that it shouldn’t be because of a tragedy that we’ve come together. It shouldn’t be like that. The world needs to respect and to love each other no matter what.”Manchester Bombing Attack: one year onManchester Bombing Attack: one year onThe Flower Festival at St Ann\u0027s Church marking the Manchester Arena bombing The Trees of Hope trail in St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Flower Festival at St Ann\u0027s Church marking the Manchester Arena bombing The Trees of Hope trail in St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Trees of Hope trailin St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Trees of Hope trailin St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesThe Trees of Hope trailin St Ann\u0027s Square where people are encouraged to leave and share tributesEmbracing Manchester Exhibition at St Ann\u0027s Church was created by artist Ghislaine Howard after being inspired by  Muslim video blogger Baktash Noori who, after the attack spent days in the city centre trying to win the trust of the public.

We are proud of our city.”Jo Mail and daughter Chloe Weatherilt, who witnessed the attack (Jessica Morgan)Max Trobe, 19, who attended the concert with his nine-year old sister, also praised the city-wide memorial effort.He told The Independent: “We made so many friends with people. Everyone was so together and you could walk around and everyone hugged each other despite not knowing each other. I’ve met people from Twitter here today, it’s interpersonal connection you don’t get in other places. It takes fear and tragedy to really bring out what’s important and that’s just sticking together and focusing on the positive.”Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, blew himself up as fans were leaving Grande’s concert at Manchester Arena.Many of those killed were children, and others included parents waiting in the lobby as the concert ended.Police have said more than 800 people were left “with physical and deep psychological injuries” as a result of the attack.Agencies contributed to this reportor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We had a celebration for the prince. There were many, many pigs. We had many, many people come who wanted to celebrate.”Strange island: Pacific tribesmen come to study BritainWith the atmosphere further lifted by kava, a drink made from a plant root said to have sedative and mood-enhancing qualities, the celebration seems to have been even more joyous than those for the duke’s 89th birthday on June 10 2010.That was when it had been prophesied that Prince Philip would come to Tanna to be with his people, living in a hut and hunting wild pigs with them.The slight disappointment that the dukeMessiah was a no-show on that occasion was mitigated by the fact that British gap year student Marc Rayner, 18, was on hand to act as a stand-in.As a stickler for protocol, the duke would doubtless have been glad to hear that Mr Rayner adopted formal dress by wearing a nambas, a slightly more extensive version of the penis sheaths that Tanna men wear in everyday life.“They are a wonderful people and I didn’t want them to feel let down,” said Mr Rayner.  “I stepped in to explain that the prince\u0027s many responsibilities prevented him from visiting in person - but that he would one day rest in spirit on the island.”As it is, however, although Tanna is the home of the so-called “cargo cult” known as the Prince Philip Movement, the duke – in bodily, if not spirit form – has never set foot on the island, one of 82 in the Vanuatu archipelago.The closest he came was in 1974, when he visited the Vanuatu capital Port Vila on the royal yacht Britannia with the Queen.Chief Jack Naiva, one of the paddlers of a traditional war canoe which greeted the royal yacht, was quoted as saying: I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform. I knew then that he was the true messiah.Tanna elders later sent Prince Philip a nal nal hunting club.  He sent them back a picture of himself holding the club.  The photo has become a cherished religious icon on Tanna.In the village of Yaohnanen there is a sort of shrine to the duke, with a Union Flag draped over framed photographs of the Queen’s consort.Last year’s announcement that he would be retiring from public life did nothing to dampen the people of Tanna’s devotion to him.Jimmy Joseph Nakou told reporters from the Associated Press that it was still the custom for villagers in Yaohnanen and Yakel to gather every evening, drink kava, and pray to Prince Philip.“We ask him to increase the production of our crops in the garden, or to give us the sun, or rain,” he said.  “And it happens.“Here in Tanna, we believe that Prince Philip is the son of our god, our ancestral god, who lives up in the mountain.Top gear: William and Kate had an Aston Martin with balloons and a JUST WED number plate.

But the cults reflect quite logical and rational attempts to make sense out of a social order that appears senseless and chaotic.”  He outlined how South Pacific populations with “highly developed cultures” had been subjected to “enormous social stress and strain” by the arrival of Europeans with “cargo” – Pidgin English for trade goods – and frightening technological power.With the 19th Century traders came missionaries, who thought it would be clever to try to make Christian ideas like the Second Coming more palatable by tacking them on to existing South Pacific beliefs.The result, however, seems to have been that instead of Christinaity, beliefs grew up that a local hero or god would come to initiate paradise on Earth and bless the people of the South Pacific with the riches of the white man’s cargo.Worsley explained that the seizure of islanders for work on the plantations of Australia and Fiji left them disinclined to swallow whole the missionaries’s teachings: “The splendid vision of the equality of all Christians began to seem a pious deception in face of the realities of the colour bar, the multiplicity of rival Christian missions and the open irreligion of many Whites.“They found that acceptance of Christianity did not bring the cargo any nearer. They grew disillusioned.”Prince Philip asks \u0027Is that a terrorist?\u0027 after seeing bearded manPrince Philip believed in nuclear disarmament, letters revealPrince Philip \u0027told Blair’s team to f*** off’ over Diana’s funeral96 Prince Philip gaffes in 96 yearsThen the Second World War came to the Pacific.On Vanuatu the appearance of so many troops and so much US military hardware seems to have boosted the “John Frum Movement” that had begun in the 1930s, and was still going strong in 1960 when David Attenborough visited to be told about a Messiah figure: “’E look like you. ‘E got white face. ‘E tall man. ‘E live ‘long South America.”On Tanna, the John Frum Movement seems to have morphed into the Prince Philip Movement some time in the 1950s or 1960s.One theory is that people on Tanna noticed the respect with which British colonial officials spoke of the Queen, and aligned Prince Philip with their traditional belief that the son of the mountain god would travel over the sea, marry a powerful woman and eventually return to his people.  One Tanna elder has suggested that the Prince Philip Movement will not die with him but be passed on to his children, and his children\u0027s children (Getty Images  WPA Pool  Pool)And at the time the duke\u0027s retirement, it was also suggested that the Prince Philip Movement would not die with him.Tanna elder Chief Tom Numake was quoted as saying: “Just because he has retired, it doesn\u0027t just stop.“It will be passed on to his children, and if they have children then it will continue on through them. The followers don\u0027t just see it as Prince Philip but that it will continue going on through the bloodline.Which does now rather suggest that in the unlikely form of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle has just got herself hitched to a husband who might one day, just possibly, come to be seen, as the Messiah, not a very naughty boy. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle weddingor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He is still wearing his Dr Martens and his ceremonial chain.“It’s a good accessory,” he smiles.Asked how he feels about the global reaction to his now famous official inauguration photo, Councillor Magid Magid’s response is as unorthodox as the image itself.“Mate… f*****g hell…” he tells The Independent, still apparently struggling for words. “It’s been surreal. Mad. I wasn’t expecting any of this.”Councillor Magid Magid, in his now famous pose after inauguration as Sheffield\u0027s Lord Mayor (Photos Chris Saunders)The 28-year-old’s election as the South Yorkshire city’s official first citizen last week made headlines around the world. He has received messages of goodwill from people as far and wide as New York and Syria. ITV News anchor Charlene White declared on Twitter that she might be “a little bit in love”.This is partly because of who he is and what he’s achieved. Councillor Magid is not only the city’s youngest ever lord mayor – and the first from the Green Party – he is also a Muslim former Somalian refugee who arrived in the UK at the age of five, unable to speak English.And it is partly because of that picture. In it, amid the shadowy, gilded confines of Sheffield’s Victorian Town Hall, he squats – complete with ceremonial chain, Dr Martens boots and wide-eyed smile – high on a balustrade.‘If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done’That Councillor Magid – who once appeared on Channel 4 reality show Hunted – is different there is no doubt.He was elected here after being nominated by his three Green Party council colleagues. When I later ask one, Alison Teal, why they put him forward, her response is simple. “He’s charming and magnetic,” she says. “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like him. He’s a born lord mayor.”The main message he wants to get across during his year in post is one of inspiring others.“If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done,” he says. “That, and to get people talking about Sheffield, about what a brilliant, erse city it is.”The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreAt his inauguration, he entered the chamber to Star Wars music and thanked his mum for “putting up with all my shit” growing up.“I was a handful,” he explains today. “Typical teenager. The important thing was thanking my mum because she’s the reason I’m here, her courage and determination for a better life.”It was his mother, Amina Deria, indeed, who took young Magid – along with his older sister Hanan Mah – out of war torn Burao in northern Somalia. After six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp, they arrived in the Burngreave area of Sheffield where she worked as a cleaner.“To me,” he says, “it’s always been home.”Lord Mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid (Chris Saunders)He did well enough at school and, after some time out in which he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, went to the University of Hull to study marine biology. There, he was elected president of the students’ union.“I cared about issues but I was pretty naive about politics,” he says. “I remember a hustings, someone asked if I was going to join a picket line. I was thinking: ‘What the fuck is a picket line?’ But I gambled and said, ‘Yeah, of course I am’, and there was a round of applause.”Around 2015, alarmed by the rise of Ukip and anti-immigration rhetoric, he joined the Greens back in Sheffield where he was working in digital marketing. He was elected to the city council a year later.“This rising xenophobic language affects me and my loved ones,” he explains. “There’s that expression that if you don’t do politics, politics will do you. I just felt I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and let that language go unchallenged. It legitimises racism and it needs to be tackled. I wanted my voice in the debate. Local politics was a way to do that.”Among his main beliefs are devolved local power, free education, an end to PFI and the creation of a republic.Now, as lord mayor, he will, as convention dictates, act as a city figurehead. “I had a white tie dinner last night,” he tells me. “I went to hire the suit – £120! I was saying: ‘I want to hire it, not buy it.’”But he plans to open the role up too. He promises to go to more events involving underrepresented communities, and wants magicians and musicians to perform in council meeting intervals – as a way of encouraging more people to interact with local democracy.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesFelix, two,sits next to messages and flowers left in Manchester, ahead of the Manchester Arena National Service of Commemoration at Manchester Cathedral to mark one year since the Manchester attack.

PHE found that for retailers’ own brand and manufacturer branded products there has been a 2 per cent reduction in total sugar per 100g.The target was set in a bid to tackle the UK’s childhood obesity crisis, with an aim to cut 20 per cent of sugar from a range of products by 2020. A third of children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, according to official figures.Sugar tax: the soft drinks that slashed their sugar ahead of the levyAs part of the programme, businesses were asked to focus on their top selling products that contribute the most sugar to the diets of children.PHE said it “recognises there are more sugar reduction plans from the food industry in the pipeline” and that some changes to products took effect after the first year cutoff point.Meanwhile, there have been reductions in sugar levels in five out of the eight food categories where progress has been measured, it added. The assessment also found that yoghurts, fromage frais, breakfast cereals, sweet spreads and sauces have all met or exceeded the 5 per cent sugar reduction. Sugar in drinks has been reduced by 11 per cent and average calories per portion by 6 per cent in response to the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), PHE found. Data also showed people are buying more drinks that have sugar levels below the SDIL cut off of 5g per 100g.Steve Brine, public health minister, said the report is encouraging, adding: “However, we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge we face.“We are monitoring progress closely and have not ruled out taking further action.”Duncan Selbie, chief executive at Public Health England, said the food industry should be “commended” for the progress so far but that more needs to be done. “Tackling the obesity crisis needs the whole food industry to step up, in particular those businesses that have as yet taken little or no action,” he added.Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “This is about tackling the nation’s obesity crisis.“Too many children and adults suffer the effects of obesity, as does society, with our NHS under needless pressure.”PHE has also published new guidelines for the drinks industry to reduce the amount of sugar children consume through juice and milk-based drinks. By mid-2021, the drinks industry is encouraged to reduce sugar in juice drinks by 5 per cent and in milk drinks by 20 per cent.

Government will soon be left with no choice but to introduce mandatory targets and there must be clarity as to the timeline for this process and what the targets would be.“We need a package of tough measures if we have any chance of reducing the amount of sugar the nation, and particularly children, are consuming, and which we know is a major contributor to the growing obesity epidemic.”Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at the campaign group Action on Sugar, said: “Whilst we welcome PHE’s first assessment of progress on the government’s sugar reduction programme, it’s evident that much more must be done – particularly on biscuits, chocolate confectionery, puddings and the large portions of high-sugar products sold in the out-of-home sector.“It’s unfair and ridiculous that the out-of-home sector products are not being reformulated to the same extent. Much stricter measures need to be in place to ensure progress is being made by the food industry and that the 20 per cent sugar reduction target is met.”Gavin Partington, director-general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: “It comes as no surprise to us that sugar intake from soft drinks has decreased by almost five times as much as other categories – down 18.7 per cent since 2013 – a trend which correlates with the industry’s strong track record in sugar reduction before the introduction of the soft drinks levy.“We are the only category on track to achieving PHE’s calorie reduction target of 20 per cent by 2020.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It can’t be time limited or it’s not a backstop.”Commission officials have pointed to the first page of the draft withdrawal agreement, which includes a note, signed off by both sides, stating that the backstop alignment can be ended only if another solution is found.“The negotiators agree that a legally operative version of the ‘backstop’ solution for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, in line with paragraph 49 of the joint report, should be agreed as part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement, to apply unless and until another solution is found,” a note on page 1 of the withdrawal agreement says.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

I see it as a huge big exercise of trust and I do believe everyone breathed a sigh of relief’A bus stop and red post box stand in the border town of Jonesborough, Co ArmaghA UK government spokesperson said: “The prime minister set out her position yesterday. The fallback solution put forward by the EU is not acceptable, and that’s why we will be bringing forward our own proposal. We want to make progress as soon as possible.”Cabinet ministers including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have signalled their unease at the backstop plan in recent days. The foreign secretary issued an apparent veiled warning to the PM while speaking to reporters on a trip to Latin America, warning her against “betrayal”.“Brexiteers fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the prime minister has been very clear that neither option is an outcome we desire – we want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it,” he said.“I’m convinced that the prime minister will be true to her promises of a Brexit deal that sees Britain come out of the customs union and single market, have borders as frictionless as possible, reject European Court of Justice interference, control immigration and free to conduct unhindered free trade deals across the world.”Bank of England Governor Mark Carney: Brexit has already hit UK GDP by up to £40bnSpeaking separately, Mr Gove was at pains to make clear that the backstop was “intended not to be implemented” and was “there just in case”.Brexiteer cabinet ministers have repeatedly rolled over for Downing Street after issuing similar veiled warnings on issues ranging from the Brexit orce bill to the transition period, however.The row over the backstop is the latest twist in the wrangling over what post-Brexit customs arrangement the UK and EU will have.The backstop was agreed on paper in December as part of a deal – the joint report – struck between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels. The section on the backstop says that “in the absence of agreed solutions” to the Northern Ireland border, “the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement”.Why both parties are changing their Brexit strategies this weekIt has since become clear that the UK and EU have begun to interpret the agreement in different ways, however. Downing Street says the entire UK will stay in alignment under the backstop, while Brussels says the agreement was intended only to maintain full alignment in Northern Ireland.The difference in interpretation comes because the UK desperately also wants to prevent customs checks at Irish Sea ports between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The DUP, on whose votes the Conservatives rely for a majority in the House of Commons, are staunchly unionist and have threatened to block any plan that puts any checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Ms May has said “no British prime minister” could agree to such a state of affairs.Brussels is, however, concerned that the UK would gain access to the single market without having to commit to its four freedoms – effectively gaining a preferential deal. Talks between the two sides started again in Brussels on Tuesday with the remaining issues of the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland and the future relationship on the agenda. With the focus of negotiations now clearly between Theresa May and her own cabinet, the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier last week said there had been little progress on any issue since the March meeting of the European Council.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Progress has been slow so far, however, with some partners such as Japan saying they would prioritise the EU ahead of Britain, or others such as the United States attaching difficult conditions.Speaking as ministers from the EU member states signed off the start of talks, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said: “This is great news. We look forward to adding Australia and New Zealand to the EU’s ever-growing circle of close trading partners. “We are already close in terms of shared values and our open, global outlook. Together, we will now negotiate win-win trade deals that create new opportunities for our businesses, as well as safeguard high standards in key areas such as sustainable development. “I am looking forward to visiting Canberra and Wellington in the coming weeks to officially launch our negotiations. Starting these talks between like-minded partners sends a strong signal at a time where many are taking the easy road of protectionism.”We look forward to adding Australia and New Zealand to the EU’s ever-growing circle of close trading partners.In September of last year, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker proposed the start of full trade talks with the two countries. Preliminary discussions between Australia and the EU were already completed in April 2017, following an announcement of intention to start a trade deal by both actors in November 2015. The Australian government says the EU is its largest export services market and also the country’s largest source of foreign investment. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has meanwhile promised not to “muck around” in doing a deal with the UK, but talks are yet to begin because Britain cannot legally start them until it has left the union.EU minister says little progress has been made on Brexit since MarchLabour MP Gareth Thomas, former trade minister and a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Once again, our international trade secretary has been outfoxed in his attempts to secure new post-Brexit free trade deals.“The supposed economic benefits of Brexit rely entirely on striking new international trade deals, but clearly most countries are more interested in negotiating with the EU, the largest trading bloc in the world, than with the UK alone.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money.

Mr Conte also said he had attended the International Kultur Institut in Vienna to refine his legal studies. The Kultur Institut is however a language school and does not offer legal courses, according to its website.The politician, who previously acted as the personal lawyer for Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the Five Star Movement, also claimed that he pursued his legal studies at Yale University, Duquesne University, the Sorbonne in Paris, and the University of Cambridge. Cambridge was unable to immediately confirm or deny whether Mr Conte had attended, citing confidentiality rules.A spokesperson for the Five Star Movement said in a statement that the criticism of the would-be prime minister’s CV showed that the press was “so afraid of this government of change”.“In his curriculum Giuseppe Conte wrote with clarity that he perfected and updated his studies at New York University. But he did not cite courses or say he completed a master’s at the university,” the spokesperson said.“Conte, like any scholar, has studied abroad, enriched his knowledge, and perfected his legal English. For a professor of his level, the opposite would have been strange. He did it and rightly wrote it in the curriculum vitae, but paradoxically this is not good now and it even becomes a fault. It is the umpteenth confirmation that the press are so afraid of this government of change.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPeople demonstrate in Paris during a nationwide day protest by French public sector employees and public servants against the overhauls proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron, calling them an attack by the centrist leader against civil services as well as their economic security.Newly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

Most DEVASTATING explosion in the universe caught on camera                Winter is coming: Exploding stars could lead to ICE AGEIf a star supernovas within 160 lightyears of Earth it could prove catastrophicBy observing supernovae that happened between 2.5 and 8 million years ago at an approximate distance of about 50 parsecs (more than 160 lightyears) away, Mr Thomas was able to determine they can affect life on Earth.He found that rather than causing a sudden apocalyptic scenario, the constant stream of solar particles from a supernova over hundreds or thousands of years can eventually deplete Earth\u0026rsquos atmosphere.This would allow more cosmic radiation to seep through to the surface which ultimately would result in slight DNA damage to various life forms.Mr Thomas said there is fossil evidence of this occurring some 2.5 million years ago.He said: There were changes, especially in Africa, which went from being more forested to more grassland.Mr Thomas adds the evidence suggests that life on Earth is affected by relatively nearby supernovae, but the increased radiation could take thousands of years to take effect.He said: There is a subtler shift. Instead of a \u0027wipe-out everything\u0027, some organisms are better off and some are worse off."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/secondary/Tesco-1352864.jpg","title":"tesco direct close jobs tesco news online shopping","story":"Tesco Direct will cease trading in July putting 500 job at riskA spokesman said Tesco Direct will close on July 9, putting 500 colleagues at risk of redundancy.A statement issued by the company today confirmed the \u0026ldquonon-food website will close the website in July - although its normal food website will remain ope.The statement blamed high costs and marketing for stunting the website\u0026rsquos progress.The Tesco Direct centre in Milton Keynes will also be closed.Tesco Direct is set to close, putting 500 jobs at riskCharles Wilson, CEO of Tesco UK \u0026amp ROI, said: We want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that\u0026rsquos why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.This decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future.Non-food items will be moved over to the usual Tesco website with the statement saying this process has already begun.It said: \u0026ldquoCustomers shopping on Tesco can already buy products such as toys, home and cookware.Tesco Direct is set to be closed with 500 jobs at riskThe news comes on the same day that Marks \u0026amp Spencer announced that it is to swing the axe on over 100 stores, putting thousands of retail jobs at risk.Joanne McGuinness, national officer for the Usdaw union, said: This is devastating news for Tesco Direct staff.Usdaw officials and senior reps will now enter into consultation talks with the company where we will look closely at the business case for the proposed closure.Our priorities will be to support, advise and represent our members through this difficult period, and to get the best possible deal for them."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-news-scotland-independence-referendum-theresa-may-nicola-sturgeon-stop-brexit-963662.jpg","title":"brexit news scotland independence referendum theresa may nicola sturgeon stop brexit","story":"Brexit news: Theresa May faces a difficult decision over Scottish demands for the Brexit BillBy refusing Holyrood\u0026rsquos demands on the EU Withdrawal Bill, the Prime Minister could inadvertently begin the break up of the United Kingdom, Akash Paun said.The Senior Fellow at the Institute for Government think-tank warned any attempt by Mrs May to block Scotland\u0026rsquos request for a powerful veto over major changes post-Brexit could ultimately spell disaster for the future of the British Union.His warning comes after Holyrood last week rejected the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit plans in a landslide vote, a move which could prove to be a major stumbling block in the orce with Brussels.Mr Paun said: \u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister therefore faces a choice.

David Coburn slams SNP for handing over Scotland to EUMs Sturgeon said once there was more clarity on Brexit, she would consider a second referendum.And Mr Paun said although Scots would likely vote against independence now, attitudes could quickly change if Westminster forced through major policy changes without the consent of SNPs.He said: \u0026ldquoIt would be a gamble, no doubt. The polls do not indicate a pro-independence surge, but after the shock of 2016 only a fool would predict the outcome with confidence.The PM could risk boosting support for Scottish independence, Akash Paun said\u0026ldquoWestminster could in principle refuse to allow another referendum, but emulating Madrid\u0026rsquos handling of Catalonia would surely not be the right course of action.Scotland overwhelmingly backed Remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum, with 62 percent of voters supporting continued EU membership.In the 2014 independence referendum, 55.3 percent voted to remain part of the UK while 44.7 percent backed a split."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"BANK Holiday Monday will be scorching as temperatures soar this weekend.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed.

But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history.

Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I might only have a slim chance.According to Sky News, the mum-of-one added: There is something called clemency.Give me that for the sake of my baby. She hasnt seen her father for over two years now.I would ask the judge today to close this new case and give me parole, so that I can go home and have another baby and have a normal life.The judge said he would address her case as a priority.Earlier, her husband Richard said they were holding our breath after she appeared in the Iranian court on Saturday.She has been told she faces new charges of spreading propaganda and is likely to be convicted.And Boris Johnson today insisted the Foreign Office is working on a daily basis to free her.The 40-year-old charity worker appeared at the hearing where she was presented with a 200-page document and told she needed a new lawyer.Richard, speaking to The Sun Online, dismissed the so-called evidence against her.He said: Most of it seems to be press cuttings of our campaign, its not ‘evidence’ of her having done stuff.”Despite the new hearing the couple are still in the dark as to what happens next.Richard said: “Our experience of the court process so far is that it hasn’t been very positive so there’s a bit of holding our breath this time.“In terms of what happens next? Who knows.”During the hearing Judge Salavait warned her that she was likely to be found guilty and dismissed her lawyer and gave her just ten days to find a new one.The couple have been given some hope as the court allowed Nazanin to phone the British embassy for the first time since being in prison.Richard said: “The court case happened on Saturday, which made us pretty low. Then there was the phone call on Sunday which made us more upbeat.“The fact that she was allowed to call is a good thing. It’s very easy for me to over-read things and get confused.”He added the response of the embassy had been quite cautious - I guess they were trying to get their bearings on why this was allowed.”Richard added that he hoped the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson would do everything in his powers to help.He said: “We’ll try and meet with the Foreign Office this week and work out what’s going on and we will want the Foreign Secretary to do what he can.That would be an intervention. One of the things we asked before was for him to try and visit her and to make it really clear that the UK was standing by her.“We also asked that the Government protest – the ambassador protesting and the Foreign Secretary protesting, which would be a more serious level.“The gravitas of the Foreign Secretary can make a difference.”“I’d like him to do what he can. It’s not for me to tell him how to do it.”Speaking during a trip to Buenos Aires today, Mr Johnson insisted his officials are dedicated to helping the British mum.He told reporters: I can tell you absolutely sincerely that there is not a day that goes by in which we are not working in the Foreign Office on every single one of the incredibly sad consular cases that we have - and particularly the difficult cases we have in Iran.But he claimed it would not help Nazanins case to give regular updates - adding that Mr Ratcliffe should be reassured by the attention the Foreign Office is giving to her ordeal.During the hearing Judge Salavait told her she was likely to be found guilty.Human rights body Amnesty International described the judges comments of a likely conviction over the new charges as another body blow.Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s Campaigns Director, said: “This is yet another body blow for Nazanin.The latest developments in the case come at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West after Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal recently, breaking with US allies in Europe and potentially worsening the crisis in the Middle East.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signalled today that the United States would take a hardline against the Islamic Republic, saying the US would impose the strongest sanctions in history if the countrys leadership did not change its foreign and domestic policy.The actions of the US though has led to a split with its European Union allies, including Britain.Mr Johnson attempted to salvage the nuclear deal by holding crisis talks to thrash out a last-minute deal in the hope that Tehran did not ditch the deal.Nazanin has been held in Iran on spying claims since 2016, when she was arrested during a holiday with her daughter Gabriella.Nazanin was originally arrested at Tehran airport on April 3, 2016.After being detained for over five months, initially in solitary confinement for 45 days without access to a lawyer, Nazanin was sentenced to five years in prison in September 2016 after being convicted of “membership of an illegal group”.She is currently being held in Tehrans Evin Prison.Members of Nazanin’s family visited prosecutors for an update on her case earlier this month, and according to Mr Ratcliffe they say she is being used as a bargaining chip.He said she told him of the development in a 5.30am phone call on May 14, and added: I have no clue why they have started all this nonsense again. They know Boris is coming.Please take me out of this, please. My parents have had enough. I want my daughter back. She needs both of us. So tell the world. Enough of this nonsense."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jemma-page-1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how much 25 year olds bank accounts","story":"It’s the stuff of dreams, right? Well, if The Resolution Foundation had its way, this wouldn’t just be every young person’s fantasy - it would actually happen for real.The independent think tank says all 25 year-olds, no matter how rich or poor, should receive a lovely little £10k nest egg from the government to help with tuition fees, buying a home or caring costs.Supposedly, this would balance out inter-generational unfairness to help young people, already priced out of the housing market and struggling with insecure jobs, to stand on their own financial feet.But, if this were to happen in reality, would anyone really look after the handout in a sensible way and invest it wisely in their future?Or would they head to the nearest travel agent and splurge it on a one-way trip to Bali? We take a closer look at the bank accounts and spending habits of five 25 year-olds and ask them the question outright...Salary: £22,000Rent: £625 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 4Balance of current account: £24.52Any savings? I have no savings at all. I can’t afford to save each month due to the cost of rent and bills.What I spend money on: The majority of my wage goes on bills. Living in Nottingham city centre, where I work, isn’t cheap.I spend around £260 a month on bills like insurance, gas and electricity, £46 a month on my phone.Other monthly bills include Apple Music and Netflix which adds up to around £16.I allow £50 a month for petrol and around £50 a month for football. I’m a Mansfield Town FC fan and, when the football season is on, I go to as many away games as possible a month. I have a season ticket, which costs me around £350 a year.I’m also a grassroots football coach for under 13s girls’ club and we have training every Friday and games on Sunday which is how I spend so much on petrol.After this, I have around £273.33 a month to live off, which is around £65 a week.This is the money I use for food, going out with friends, seeing family and going to London once a month to see my boyfriend.I eat lots of cheap foods - such as pasta, rice, chickpeas - and do two food shops in Aldi (one a fortnight).I dont drink alcohol, just a choice as I dont like the taste or not being in control of myself, so that saves me a lot of money on nights out - lime and sodas are only around 20p!I also have quite a hefty credit card bill (£1,500) due to previously being extremely bad with money.I currently pay off £150 a month – it’s 0 per cent interest – but if I have any spare money left over, I’ll put it on there too.What I’d do with £10,000: I’d love to say I’d do something sensible like put a deposit down on a house but I don’t know where I want to be in a few years’ time and my partner and I aren’t ready to move in together yet.So the first thing I’d do is pay off my credit card. It would give me an extra £150 a month, which would make living a lot more comfortable.Salary: £24,000Rent: £650 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 4Balance of current account: £300Any savings? 7p in an ISAWhat I spend my money on: My basic monthly expenditure goes on rent, a travel card, bills – compulsory boring stuff.Then there are the night outs, meals out, after work drinks, gym membership, shopping too - I do love a bargain from a charity or vintage shop and I also donate to disability charity Leonard Cheshire.Depending on how social I’ve been in the month, when I get down to my last £100 I go into hermit monk mode – simple meals and quiet nights in.Cheese and beans on toast is a favourite - humble but always hits the spot, or scrambled eggs on toast or an omelette.I haven’t had savings since I went travelling after university and used up whatever I had.There is now just 7p in my ISA. If I was strict I probably could save, but paying off my credit card and overdraft is my first priority.I’ve got a manageable financial plan and if I stick to it and don’t spontaneously treat myself to a European city break, I’ll pay off everything in the next 12 months.What I’d do with £10,000: I would pay off my credit card, book a couple of mini city breaks to Greece, Amsterdam and Tel Aviv then put the rest towards a deposit for my first home.Rent: £150 a monthSalary: £28,000Rent: £550 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 3Balance of current account: Nearly £1000Any savings? £2000What I spend my money on: I spend it on rent, bills, travel card, gym memberships (one near home and another near work where I have a great gym buddy), occasionally on clothes and make-up but only when I feel like splurging out, say, on a handbag and, of course, on going out.Youll find me at polis Night Club in East London nearly every Friday night or in central London, and I can easily spend £50 in one evening.I manage my money quite well and usually make the next payday with at least £500. Im proud to say Ive never been overdrawn.I have a couple of grand in savings. I have a terrible habit of dipping into my savings, although I am getting better at putting £50-£100 away each month.What I’d do with £10,000: Id put £8,500 into a fixed-rate ISA with the aim of it generating more over the coming years.In terms of using the full £10,000 to put a deposit on a house or start a business - it wouldnt go a long way.Therefore, Id put the majority in a savings account, treat my parents to a mini weekend away and maybe have a look at what Selfridges has to offer.Salary: Up to £28,000Rent: £800 a monthNumber of bank accounts: 3Balance of current account: £160Any savings? Less than £1,000What I spend my money on: Mostly food when I go out, bills, clothes and a lot goes on the tube for work.I spend £800 on rent including electricity, TV licence, gas and electricity but I live with my mum and sister so we share responsibility over costs.I spend about £280 a month on travel too.I probably go out once a week but my budget is set at about £100 a month for going out. Its quite difficult to stick to but I do my best.I do occasionally go out to buy clothes but this wouldnt be every month.I’ve saved a little by being quite organised. Ive created a budget, taking into account my rent, essential costs such as travel for work and my full disposable income then I decide how much I’m willing to spend on fun activities in the month, and set aside some money every month for savings and holidays.What I’d do with £10,000: Invest £1,000 into business ideas, some into a holiday for my family and the rest put aside for a house.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not in my wildest imagination [did he expect to be asked].“I have to admit I had no idea, I really didn’t. When I said the sermon I remember thinking to myself – I hope that’s ok.Bishop Curry’s sermon, to 600 people in the historic church in the grounds of Windsor Castle, lasted around 13 minutes and quoted Martin Luther King.During the speech guests, including David Beckham, were spotted beaming - while members of the royal family looked a mixture of bemusement and shock.Prince William was caught sheepishly smirking in front of the Queen and Prince Philip at St Georges Chapel in Windsor.While Harry and Meghan shared smiles as they held hands.Forty thousand people a minute tweeted about his rousing address, with the sermon the most talked about subject online during the whole Royal Wedding.The 65-year-old preacher is an outspoken advocate of LGBT issues and has campaigned over social injustice and racial inequality.He told GMB that he was firmly behind the new Duchess of Sussex who had previously said she is “proud to be a feminist and a woman.Bishop Curry said: “They’re [Harry and Meghan] going to work to make this world better and empowering women is one of the ways we do that.”During his speech the frocked preacher said the word “love” an astonishing 65 times (plus “beloved” twice).It caused the wedding service to overrun by eight minutes.He mentioned fire 20 times — more than the number of times he referred to God.Quoting Luther King, Curry said: We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love.And when we do that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.The bishop then added: Theres power in love. Dont underestimate it. Dont even over-sentimentalise. There is power, power in love.Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who married Harry and Meghan, said of the sermon: I think what we saw in that is that preaching is not a past art, the use of language to communicate the good news of Jesus Christ just blew the place open, it was fantastic.He also said members of the Royal Family were excited and gripped by Bishop Currys sermon.Although pictures showed the Queen looking stoney faced throughout the speech."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000045900007-e1526972366816.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wood burning stove ban pollution and what do","story":"Others say they are being unfairly blamed and it is car fumes that do the damage.

having to stop to swipe away a bee.He left his new wife giggling as he tried to bat the insect away, saying: Sorry, that bee really got me.While Prince Charles birthday may be in November, it was chosen to celebrate his big day today to make the most of the summer weather.The garden party being held this month will also help to stagger out the events that the royal family will attend this year.Meghan Markle made sure to stamp her seal on royal fashion, with the website for the designers of her dress crashing within minutes of her being spotted in the cream ensemble.The Flavia silk-crepe pencil dress from British brand Goat was tailored to fit the new royal perfectly.And the dress struck a chord with the public, with the brands website down for about 10 minutes as people desperately tried to get their hands on the £590 outfit.This afternoons event was a poignant one for its guests, with the garden party falling on the anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing.Prince Harry also made sure to pay tribute to them, praising the emergency services workers for their selfless bravery on the tragic night.More than 6,000 people were in attendance at todays event, all linked to charities that Charles supports in celebration of his patronage work.The four royals posed for a photo with the representatives from organisations with which Prince Charles has worked with closely.It comes after the Royal Family yesterday released their first updated family photo, taken by acclaimed photographer Alexi Lubomirski, to include Meghan and her mum, yoga instructor Doria Ragland.One of the photos showed the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla Parker-Bowles, Doria Ragland, Prince William, Kate Middleton and their bridesmaids and pageboys posing in the Green Drawing Room of Windsor Castle.Another showed the couple surrounded simply by their bridesmaids and pageboys.The third showed the couple by themselves, with the black and white image showing Prince Harry holding his bride protectively in his arms.The couple had this week been praised after their wedding, with experts saying their union had thrown the Royal Family into the 21st century.The romantic ceremony had included a passionate speech from American Bishop Michael Curry, as well as a stunning gospel rendition of Ben E Kings Stand By Me.The couples love for each other was also shown in the reception afterwards, with Prince Harry telling his bride were a great team.The big day was a success despite the drama that unfolded in the week beforehand, with Meghans father Thomas Markle pulling out at the last moment.The 73-year-old, who lives in Mexico, had heart surgery in the days before the wedding.It was also revealed that the recluse had posed in staged snaps with the paparazzi."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408118077.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle sister in law tracy dooley nephew tyler royal wedding return us","story":"Meghans former sister-in-law Tracy Dooley and nephew Tyler beamed as they landed back in Los Angeles overnight, crowing that the wedding was beautiful after watching it on TV.The mother and son gave no hint at the problems they had encountered during the trip after 25-year-old Tyler was caught trying to carry a knife into a London nightclub.The legal cannabis farmer had admitted having the four-inch blade on him - blaming Donald Trump for making it sound like he needed it for protection in Londons war zone.But while Tyler didnt respond to questions over what had happened, mum Tracy told reporters it had been a misunderstanding.She also said that the wedding had been beautiful as she walked through the airport with her son.Tracy, who was previously married to Meghans half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, is just one of Meghan Markles estranged family members to have made the most of the US actress high profile marriage.She and Tyler spent about a week in London for the wedding and were rumoured to have been invited to be special correspondents for Good Morning Britains rolling coverage of the wedding.But ITV later confirmed the estranged family members of the bride would not be part of its coverage.Despite apparently being dumping, the pair seemed to make the most of their time in London.Among their mountains of luggage -

despite Tracy admitting she hadnt spoken to the US actress in 20 years.Tyler, who said he last spoken to Meghan three years ago, recently revealed that he planned to create a strain of cannabis in his aunts name.The strain is expected to be called Markles Sparkle.The 25-year-old reportedly claims to be a “pioneer” in an industry, which is now legal in the US.He has also claimed that he would be more than happy to offer Meghan and her new husband Prince Harry a sample.His dad Thomas Markle Jr has previously swung back and forth between praising Harry and Meghan -

I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.”The tragedy occurred on March 16, 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.She told the tribunal: “The plan was for the baby to be delivered by a Caesarian section.I thought with a C-section we might not have a live baby and it would have been a difficult procedure.Dr Laxman urged the mother to attempt a natural birth rather than having a C-section“I still believe we had a very good chance of having the baby using other options than a C-section but we had to act fast.The bottom of the baby came out quite easily and when this happened I thought it was going to be possible.“I started to encourage the patient to push. Whilst she was pushing I applied some traction to the baby’s feet so I could deliver the baby. She was doing well.“After that there was some difficulty in delivering the arms.The arms were then delivered and I went to deliver the baby’s head, I was trying to flex the baby’s head but I didn’t feel the baby move and the cervix started to close. I tried to deliver a couple of times and asked for help.”Laxman said she to tried to cut the cervix but the incision had no impact.She added: “We made another cut to the cervix and I used my index finger to flex the baby’s head.But, at some point between the general anaesthetic and the decapitation, the baby died - I’m not sure when.”I was told the neck was tearing and that’s when I knew the baby had died.The hearing continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405543210.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn is alienating both sides of brexit debate and should start backing second referendum tony blair says","story":"The ex-PM claimed the current Labour boss is a closet Eurosceptic who is refusing to take a strong stance on Brexit.And ultra-Europhile Mr Blair said Mr Corbyn should throw his weight behind a second EU referendum.He claimed Labour’s vow to leave the single market but stay in the customs union would create “the worst of both worlds”.Mr Blair added: “If the reason for being against the single market is we don’t want to be merely rule takers, then the customs union solution has the same objections.”He said Labour’s support for a customs union is an “unacceptable compromise” for Leave voters.But at the same time pro-EU voters were also “losing faith in Labour as a route to avoid Brexit”, Mr Blair insisted.Speaking on BBC Radio 4s Today programme this morning, he said: That ambiguity probably did serve Labour well at the last election... I dont think it works any more today.Were in a position now of not pleasing the Remainers or the Leavers.Mr Blair concluded: I think the sensible thing for the Labour party to do is to say, if we want a jobs-first Brexit the sensible thing to do is to stay close to Europes economic area.If people then say, Whats the point of leaving?, you say the final decision should be taken by the British people on whether to proceed on this basis.In the same interview, the former PM insisted he had no idea that a Libyan dissident had been sent from Britain to his home country when he was in power.Mr Blair said he acknowledged Theresa Mays decision to make a formal apology to Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar.He added: I have gone along with what the Governments done, which is issue the apology, I didnt actually know myself about this case until after I left office.The couple were sent to a prison run by the forces of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lg5_0676-1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"a and e live davina mccall","story":"No two days are the same, she says. We deal with everything from minor issues right up to terrible injuries - and it changes from hour to hour.Suicide attempts, car accidents, head injuries, strokes, bashes and broken bones  - all of them are in a day’s work for Chanele and her colleagues.It’s a dramatic, fast-moving world, and one which television cameras will aim to capture as it unfolds when ITV broadcasts live from their A\u0026ampE department.A\u0026ampE Live marks 70 years of the NHS, and the show, fronted by Davina McCall, will be taking place over the next three nights.And the production crew, just like the doctors and nurses, will have no idea what will burst through the doors of the hospital and into one of the UKs leading trauma centres.There will certainly be no shortage of patients - each day the department deals with an average of 350-400 people, and while there are occasional quiet periods in the middle of the night, it’s normally a hectic 24-hour operation.Patients could include the walking wounded, those stretchered in by an ambulance dash or even someone brought in by the helicopter for emergencies where every second counts.Things have got a lot busier in the sixteen years I’ve worked here, says Chanele.  Even within the last twelve months, you can see attendances are increasing.An ageing population, more complex problems and changing expectations have all contributed to the rise in numbers.Then there’s the frequent flyers – those who attend A\u0026ampE regularly - and a convenience culture which means patients often arrive at A\u0026ampE when they would be better off seeing their GP.The latter has become so prevalent that it has led Leeds General Infirmary to pilot a scheme in which a GP is in attendance in their A\u0026ampE 12 hours a day, seven days a week to relieve the pressure on their harried staff.As a major trauma centre the department has also seen the impact of rising knife crime.We see stabbing injuries quite regularly, says Chanele. It can be all ages – we have had middle-aged victims although most are younger – and the outcomes are varied.Some people can get stabbed in the arm and survive, but someone can get stabbed in the chest and not make it.Inside the department abuse is also a daily reality: most A\u0026ampE staff see being sworn at as part of a day’s work although thankfully physical violence, though it happens, is less common due to the presence of security staff.However, some frustrated patients take out their anger on walls and chairs, which can be stressful for staff and other patients.Lets hope the show it isnt too gory, as Davina previously exclusively revealed to The Sun that her fear of blood could pose some problems.“I have to brace myself, she said. I’m very squeamish - I think I’m going to need to see a hypnotist beforehand because I’m not very good with blood.That would be terrible if the presenter faints live on air, wouldn’t it?”Then there’s the families.Some of our patients are going through the most horrific day of their lives - but that also means a huge trauma for their family too, Chanele explains.Many of them are in shock  - they have someone they love in the resuscitation area and they don’t always know what is happening.We try to include them as much as we can – we have to think not only of the patient but their carer as well.Poignantly, the ultimate fate of their patients usually remains unknown.Once they leave the department, whether it is to go home or to care elsewhere in the hospital, most A\u0026ampE staff never get to hear about what happened next.The reality is that we can only deal with what is right in front of us though, Chanele explains.Because as we’ve seen, there’s little in the way of breathing space – not that Chanele would have it any other way.I couldn’t think of doing anything else,’ she says.

Tony dug out the rubble behind the door and discovered another ladder.Chris added: “It’s an emergency escape ladder in case the first one was destroyed or blocked by rubble from a bomb.“It’s not worth fully digging it out as it’s a small area.”Chris said neighbours had mentioned the possibility of a bunker in the back garden.He said: “I’ll be asking them more about it.

Over a million premises already have direct access to them, but if we are to achieve our ambition of a truly high-speed economy, and keep up with our competitors, then we need a step change in our approach.”The targets will be met by freeing up businesses to deliver the internet revolution rather than a huge injection of new government money, Mr Hammond said.In a tongue lashing to flagging British businesses, he also called on them to step up and do a far better job of embracing new technology and practices.Many of the UK’s companies are failing to learn from their competitors and keep up with productivity improvements, the Chancellor argued.“We need business leaders in this room and around the country to embrace innovation and technological change and to invest in driving productivity growth.”Labour attacked The Tory Treasury chief for presiding over productivity growth hitting its lowest level in 200 years.A Labour spokesman said: “Sadly this announcement only offers a drop in the ocean compared to the amounts of money really needed to take our country forward”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen.

It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

He had definitely had a procedure done – he wasn’t feeling very well. He seemed like he was in a bit of pain. Heart surgery obviously isn’t something minor.“He definitely wanted to lay low. He was given his space and he did not come out of the guesthouse.It was an apartment with a full kitchen so he could cook. He didn’t have any visitors – it was a bit sad that he was all by himself.“He checked out on Monday and said he was feeling better and well rested. It is good to see him back on his feet again.”He emerged from the guesthouse, in a gated compound three miles south of Antonio Del Mar, on Monday afternoon, after telling the landlady that his daughter looked “beautiful” at the wedding.Despite recovering from heart surgery, Thomas Sr was picked up by a pal, single mum Lori Davis, 38, and driven to a Starbucks, where he was seen holding a creamy Frappuccino with whipped crème.The Emmy Award-winning lighting expert was then taken back to his scruffy cliff-top home – carrying a bag marked ‘personal belongings’. It was one week since he had been seen at the property – following the heart drama which eventually saw him ruled out of attending the royal wedding on health grounds.He had told TMZ on Monday last week that he suffered a heart attack six days previous and was not going to go to the royal wedding. Twenty-four hours later he informed the website that he had checked into hospital.The father-of-three underwent surgery on Wednesday – later revealing that three stents had been inserted into his blood vessels. He then told TMZ that he had crossed over the border, 45 minutes from his Mexican home, and was recovering in California, where he watched Meghan get hitched from the bedroom of a ‘safe house’.Thomas Sr, who watched as Prince Charles gave Meghan, 36, away, told the website it was “emotional a joyful”, adding: “My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy. I wish I were there and I wish them all my love and all happiness.“The service was beautiful and its history. I will always regret not being able to be there and not being able to hold my daughters hand. My baby girl is a duchess and I love her so much.“When you watch your child get married, every thought goes through your mind, every memory from the first day she was born, the first time I held her.”The Sun told on Monday how Meghan and Harry – who had spoken to Thomas Sr during an emotional phone call on Thursday – were discussing plans to visit him.They are thought to be leaving on their honeymoon this week, following Saturday’s glitzy wedding at Windsor Castle – attended by David Beckham, Oprah, Tom Hardy and George Clooney.

So the inescapable conclusion is that Mr Livingstone has jumped before he was pushed. After left-wing activist Marc Wadsworth was expelled for bringing the party intro disrepute for comments towards the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth a few weeks ago, the disciplinary panel would probably had found against \"Red Ken\" too.Critics of Mr Corbyn claimed earlier this year that he had hounded out Labour\u0027s former general secretary Iain McNicol, awarded a peerage on the eve of the Royal Wedding last week, and that his replacement, former Unite official Jennie Formby, was a stooge.As a result, his one-year suspension was extended by another year.It was then that the Labour MP John Mann confronted the former London mayor in front of reporters in Westminster, accusing him of being a \"Nazi apologist\".Mr Mann, who chairs parliament\u0027s All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism, chased Mr Livingstone up the stairs at the Westminster offices of Sky News, shouting and calling him a \"f****** disgrace\", which resulted in extraordinary TV pictures showing the clash.This year, the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party has become more damaging.An unprecedented demonstration by Jewish organisations, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, filled Parliament Square and there was evidence that the row robbed Labour of taking control of Barnet Council in the elections on 3 May.After the Parliament Square demonstration, the leaders of the same organisations held a meeting with Mr Corbyn in Westminster, but immediately dismissed the talks as a missed opportunity.The first demand of these Jewish groups - and the so-called \"moderate\" Labour MPs who joined them in Parliament Square in March - was the expulsion of Mr Livingstone from the party.Some of Mr Livingstone\u0027s strongest critics are disappointed that he was not put through the formal disciplinary procedure and expelled, claiming that would have made his return to the party impossible, while resignation leaves the door slightly ajar.In his resignation statement, Mr Livingstone said he recognised he had caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. \"I am truly sorry for that,\" he said.But he said he does not accept the allegation that he has brought the Labour Party into disrepute, nor guilty of anti-Semitism. That suggests he is unrepentant and remains defiant.

The terms of the bequest stipulated that it should be only used to pay off the entire national debt. Despite growing 800-fold in value since the original \u0026pound500,000 donation, the fund has never been sufficient to clear all of the nation’s debt.  It has therefore remained locked in the specially created National Fund. The Fund has since grown to \u0026pound400million, but is dwarfed by the debt - which in December was estimated at \u0026pound1.7trillion. It has never been worth more than 0.066% of the national debt. Attorney General Jeremy Wright filed documents at the High Court, urging judges to alter the terms of the trust fund and release the money for its intended use.  Mr Wright said: “Almost 90 years ago, an anonymous donor bequeathed money to the nation and yet we have not been able to put it to good use. “We have been working with the Treasury, trustees and the Charity Commission to find a solution consistent with the donor’s original objectives of extinguishing the national debt. “I am applying to the High Court to ask that the fund is released - and if that application is successful, the fund could be used to benefit the nation by helping to do what the original donors intended.” Barclays, which manages the charitable fund, has been trying for years to get permission to use the money to make charitable grants or to turn it over to the Treasury. But any change has to be approved by a court.

Lord Tyrie, who lost his seat in 2017, is a former chairman of the Treasury select committee. But despite serving as a Tory MP for a decade, he will not be taking the Conservative whip when he joins the House of Lords. This will be a particular blow to the Prime Minister who has recently suffered 15 defeats on Brexit in the Lords. Theresa May triggered fury when she announced a fresh batch of Conservative cronies for the Upper Chamber under cover of the Royal Wedding.  In theory she created nine new Tory peers, three new Labour Lords and gave the DUP one. But with Tyries admission that reduces the Tories\u0027 haul to eight. The Electoral Reform Society estimates the extra Lords and Ladies could add another \u0026pound1,079,000 per year to the total bill, with peers able to trouser \u0026pound305 a day just for turning up. Lord Tyrie, who has been appointed head of Britain\u0027s competition watchdog, faced accusations of impartiality if he took up his seat on the Tory benches. Cabinet Office spokesman Lord Young of Cookham said today that Lord Tyrie will sit in the Lords as a non-affiliated peer. Lord Young was responding to concerns raised by Lord Newby, Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, at question time. Lord Newby asked if ministers agreed with the Institute for Government that Andrew Tyrie cannot be an independent chair of the Competition and Markets Authority and take the Government whip, but should sit as an independent crossbencher instead.  Lord Young said Mr Tyrie was a robustly independent-minded chairman of the Treasury select committee in the last Parliament and regularly held the Government to account. I have spoken to Lord Tyrie this morning and can confirm he will be sitting as a non-affiliated peer ... and not be in receipt of the Conservative whip. Mr Tyrie is among nine new Conservative peers announced last week along with one Democratic Unionist and three Labour.  Tory Lord Garel-Jones said Jeremy Corbyn had given an undertaking that if elected leader of the Labour party he would not nominate any new peers and asked what might have led him to change his mind.  Lord Young said Mr Corbyn had recognised that the Lords has a role to play in holding the Government to account and had, when campaigning to be leader, said he could see no case for appointing new Labour peers. I\u0027m delighted that sensible heads on the Opposition benches have persuaded him to change his mind and help refresh the Labour benches, he said.

Influential Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg questioned the figure which he said had been “plucked out of the air”. And he hit out at rules which are stopping much-needed Doctors from coming to Britain. Rees-Mogg, who heads up the pro-Brexit European Research Group, told the BBC’s Daily Politics: “I think the issue with leaving Europe is about controlling immigration and deciding what is in our interest, not about pulling up the drawbridge, and our current immigration system does idiotic things. A few weeks ago we wouldn’t allow in 100 Indian doctors when the NHS is crying out for doctors.  “We seem to have an immigration system that is so focused on being authoritarian, so focused on the rules… and too focused on a number that was plucked out of the air.”  Meanwhile last night Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson also slammed her party\u0027s approach to immigration describing how the Windrush scandal had made her feel hurt and angry.  She said the tone of the immigration debate had been far too judgemental. And said the overall target to bring net migration below 100,000 should be reviewed. Ms Davidson also said she would love to see students taken out of migration figures commenting: I don\u0027t see what use they are being there.  Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Davidson said a mature debate was needed.

Mr Adams, who makes at least \u0026pound30,000 a year from renting out properties, joined 71 Tory colleagues who are also landlords to vote against a Labour amendment to the Housing and Planning Bill in 2016. The rule would have forced landlords to ensure their properties were fit for human habitation.  But the Labour-proposed amendment was rejected by 312 votes to 219. According to Parliament’s register of interests, 72 of the MPs who voted against the amendment are themselves landlords who derive an income from a property. The entry for Mr Adams reveals that he co-owns one mixed use commercial and residential property in Selby, North Yorkshire which he co-owns with his wife.

The stunning snap shows the Queen and the next FOUR in line to the throne: Princes Charles, William, George and the three-year-old Princess Charlotte. Prince Louis, just one month old, was absent from the days events.  James Brookes, director of communications at Royal Central , said the photo, one of three released by Kensington Palace, will be seen as turning point for the monarchy in 50 years time.   Speaking to MirrorOnline he said: 70 years ago the monarchy almost collapsed because a king wanted to marry an American divorcee. He was shunned forever for it. Now we have a beautiful official photo featuring not just an American divorcee but an American divorcee who is mixed race, something else which is rare with the royal family. It is hard overstate just how important this photo could prove to be. It points to the fact it was a modern wedding, something both Harry and Meghan wanted to have. They wanted to put their own stamp on the wedding and they did but they are both still aware of the tradition Harry\u0027s family is steeped in. They\u0027re not shying away from that but they are showing the royal family is open to change.   The pictures, taken by fashion photographer Alexi Lubomirski , are significantly different from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding photos from 2011 - which are more formal.  James says that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, ages 33 and 36 respectively, are likely to have more freedom to break with tradition than Harry\u0027s older brother who is second in line to the throne. The shape of the royal family is going to change dramatically over the next 10 to 15 years. The Queen and Prince Philip will no longer be with us, Charles will be king and Prince William will take over as Prince of Wales.  William and Kate know what\u0027s coming so they are sometimes a little bit more reserved. They want to make sure they can take on the baton. Harry and Meghan have less pressure on them because it is unlikely they will be on the throne. But they will still hold a lot of power on how the royal family moves with the time. You could tell from the ceremony, which was magnificent, they want to bring about change. And this photo shows that, it shows that they are open to change, however slowly it may be.

The three gorgeous photos were taken in Windsor Castle\u0027s Green Drawing Room, the same room where the royal family, including the Queen, Princess Diana, and a very energetic young Prince William, posed for Harry\u0027s official christening photos. Behind the scenes footage from that special day back in 1984 gives a touching insight into the intimate occasion, where Prince Charles can be seen lifting up his young son William while the Queen mum lovingly holds her great-grandson. The special footage, which was first broadcast as part of the Queen\u0027s Christmas message at the time, shows the royals chatting away while younger members of the family play freely.  An energetic Prince William can be seen running along the long corridor before being picked up by his dad Charles.

When Frankie was born, he weighed about the same as a cup of coffee and at first his chances of survival were slim.  Parents Michelle and Pete Thompson were shocked when her labour started early and their baby was born 16 weeks prematurely at St Peter\u0027s Hospital in Chertsey.  Immediately after birth, the 378g (13oz) baby boy was placed into a sandwich bag and resuscitated successfully. His mum and dad were told the first two days would be critical and they had to tell his eight-year-old step-sister he might not make it.  Doctors and nurses then faced a gruelling battle to ensure Frankie did not suffer from any of the birth defects that affect premature babies. Now, held in the arms of his doting mother in their Farnborough family home, Frankie is a happy healthy baby with a clean bill of health and against all the odds, a normal life ahead of him.  In fact, leading child experts say that he may even be Britain\u0027s lightest ever surviving baby boy, Get Surrey reports.  The chances of survival for a 400g baby boy is around 25% and surviving without moderate to severe brain damage is astonishingly low, at around 7%. Dr David Evans, The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Vice President for Training and Assessment said: Smaller baby girls have survived in Britain, but I am unaware of such a tiny boy surviving. Michelle, 36, is incredibly grateful to doctors and nurses at both St Peters and Frimley Park hospitals in Chertsey and Camberley respectively, for saving her son\u0027s life. She said: From the minute I was told to go into Frimley Park they were amazing. It was a massive shock to find out I was going into labour but they dealt with me straight away.  Hospital staff were able to delay Frankie\u0027s birth by almost three days in total by using various different methods. Michelle was then transferred to St Peter\u0027s to give birth. She continued: Again, it was amazing care. They had already gone through what would happen if he does come. After the birth we were told that the first two days were very critical and he was so small so we thought there wasn\u0027t much chance. We then had to think about telling his eight-year-old step-sister, Tilly, who was taken out of school and told that he might not make it. Six weeks later, Frankie was moved back to Frimley Park and things started to look more optimistic. Michelle phoned everyday and remembers holding her breath as the hospital staff answered. Born on September 25, 92 days later, on Boxing Day, Frankie was eventually allowed to go home with breathing assistance.  Michelle, who works as a flight attendant for British Airways said: The neonatal nurses come out on a regular basis check his oxygen and work out when they can next turn it down. Unfortunately he did get bronchitis after a month and went back in but again it was amazing care, everyone was on top of things. He literally stopped breathing as I arrived at the hospital and they were there within seconds. Because he was so premature we have kind of VIP access to children\u0027s ward and if we didn\u0027t have that service things might not have turned out so well. Luckily because Farnborough is a small area all my friends and family are just around the corner and I couldn\u0027t have coped without them all. The kids in the street have been amazing too especially for Tilly. It\u0027s lovely for her and it is lovely for us. There is a nice community spirit and everyone is so pleased for him. Michelle recently returned to St Peter\u0027s to visit the doctors and nurses who saved her son\u0027s life.

The happy couple - who are postponing their honeymoon so they can fulfil official engagements - are at a Buckingham Palace garden party this afternoon being held to celebrate Prince Charles turning 70 later this year. But there is something familiar about the Prince of Wales\u0027 outfit - he appears to be wearing the exact same suit he wore for the nuptials on Saturday. The tailored grey suit which comes with a matching waistcoat seems to have been recycled for today\u0027s occasion, a mere few days after he last donned it.  And with the wedding being possibly the most photographed event of the year, he hasn\u0027t quite got away with it. While at Windsor\u0027s wedding he teamed the ensemble with a lilac tie, today he has gone for a blue one.  His suit also looks remarkably familiar to one he wore back in 2016 , at the society wedding between Alexandra Knatchbull, 35, the great-granddaughter of Lord Mountbatten, and Thomas Hooper.  There was speculation at the time Charles had given Alexandra away because of her own father Lord Bradbourne\u0027s ill health. Prince Charles wouldn\u0027t be the first royal to recycle an outfit. The Duchess of Cambridge was initially accused by some fans of trying to upstage Meghan on her wedding day by wearing a cream Alexander McQueen dress with a nude pair of Jimmy Choo heels and a Philip Treacy hat. Wearing white or cream to a wedding is largely seen as a faux pas.   But actually, Kate had made every effort not to upstage the bride at St George\u0027s Chapel as it was the fourth time she\u0027d worn the coat.  For many of her looks over the years, she has wore the dress or coat once or twice before. Today, Prince Charles appears to have followed in the footsteps of his daughter-in-law and got his wedding outfit back on again.

The family had previously had the bowl valued 27 years ago but its estimated price then was far lower than what it has fetched now, as the Asian art market continues to boom.

The 6ft 2in beast had been tipped to become the ultimate guard dog to deter burglars. But instead he turned into a real-life Scooby Doo who is even afraid of his neighbour’s pugs. Fed-up owner Mary-Ann Riley struggles to walk Dez because he is scared of cars and lampposts. She said he jumps into her arms at the slightest noise such as rustling bags or the dishwasher.  Mary-Ann, 46, spent two years trying to ‘toughen up’ her petrified pooch before seeking professional help. She booked Dez into behaviour therapy classes in the hope it would give him some confidence.

Mary-Ann, from Alfreton, Derbys, said: “When we first got Dez he was petrified of everything – he was the real-life Scooby Doo.  “He used to be scared of anything covered in faux fur, he’d flinch when I’d open a tin and cower in fear whenever we walked past a lamp post. “I knew that I had to do something to help him get over his fears, or he’d be too scared to live his life. “I found a dog training course that would help him get over his worries, and we’ve been twice a week for over two years. “But despite that, he is still scared by lawn mowers, tractors, motorbikes and the neighbour’s four pugs.”  Mary-Ann adopted Dez as a rescue puppy and he initially appeared boisterous around other dogs. But the housewife said: “As soon as he got home his true side showed. “He would run away when the dishwasher was on and tiptoe around any lamppost he walked past. “He was scared of practically everything in our house. “I knew something has to be done – such a big dog couldn’t be scared of such little things.

When she contacted the carrier, Ryanair told the girls they could pay up front for another flight home with a different airline today and then put in a claim for compensation - or they could book them on the next available Ryanair flight from Palma to Prestwick on Friday.  If the girls had decided to stay until Friday, they would have had to fork out up front for their extra nights of accommodation, and then make a claim to Ryanair once they were home. Kirsty\u0027s worried mum Elaine Collins called the airline on her daughter\u0027s behalf and was told by the airline\u0027s customer services department there was nothing they could do. She said: Kirsty needs to get home, she\u0027s got work to get back to and two kids at home. People are saying there are worse places to be stuck but that\u0027s no use when you\u0027ve got work and kids to get back for or if you haven\u0027t got the money for the new flights or the extra days. Kirsty has insurance but some of the girls in the group are younger and don\u0027t have the money to pay for new flights or hotels upfront, or insurance. It\u0027s the last couple of days of their holiday and they\u0027ve been going out and spent all their money. Ryanair said the cancellation was due to a French air traffic controller strike and is understood to have affected a number of flights across Europe, although some airlines are still flying from Mallorca. A Ryanair spokeswoman said: This flight from Palma de Mallorca to Glasgow Prestwick (22 May) was regrettably cancelled due to a French ATC strike, which has resulted in all major airlines in Europe cancelling flights. All affected customers were notified by SMS text messages and email (at 14:13 on Sunday, 20 May, 54 hours before scheduled flight time) and advised of their options - a full refund, free rebooking on to the next available flight or free transfer on to an alternative flight. This customer is currently liaising with our customer service team regarding her options. We apologise sincerely for this flight cancellation which was caused by yet another unjustified French ATC strike.

They were both stunning and sophisticated as they said their vows and married their prince, but there were key differences in their behaviour, appearance and their wedding day as a whole.  As second in line to the throne, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding was very formal, held at Westminster Abbey in April 2011.   Harry and Meghan\u0027s celebration was a lot more relaxed, and the couple have far more freedom to make their special day their own.   But how did Kate and Meghan compare as royal brides? We\u0027ve taken a look at some of the key differences between the two women\u0027s weddings.  The music they walked down the aisle to Kate decided to walk down the aisle to Sir Charles Parry\u0027s I Was Glad from Psalm 222, which was composed for the crowning of William\u0027s great-great-great grandfather Edward VII.  Kate had a VERY long walk down Westminster Abbey\u0027s VERY long aisle. Meghan on the on hand, went for a less traditional song. She had Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas singing Handel’s Eternal Source of Light Divine for her big moment, and it really was beautiful. The cost of their dresses In the lead up to the wedding there were rumours Meghan had opted for a dress which was much cheaper than Kate\u0027s. However as soon as she stepped out the car in a gorgeous pure white Givenchy number is was clear that probably wasn\u0027t the case.  Kate\u0027s detailed lace gown, designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, is believed to cost \u0026pound250,000. Meghan\u0027s dress, designed by Brit Clare Waight Keller, has an estimated price tag of \u0026pound387,000. However it is understood that she paid for her dress herself.  Holding hands Much like most of their public appearances since announcing their engagement, Harry and Meghan couldn\u0027t keep their hands off each other during the ceremony.  Kate and Wills on the other hand looked a lot more formal, and didn\u0027t hold hands as much during their service. Who walked them down the aisle Following with tradition, Kate\u0027s dad Michael walked her down the aisle. Meghan\u0027s dad Thomas was due to do the same, but he dropped out for medical reasons after having heart surgery. This meant she was left with nobody to walk her down the aisle just days before the big moment.  In the end she decided to walk the first part on her own, which many have said is a nod to her strong feminist beliefs. She asked her future father-in-law Prince Charles to accompany for the final part stretch. Their age Kate and Meghan are the same age but they walked up the aisle seven years apart. Compared to their mother-in-law Princess Diana, who was just 20 when she married Prince Charles, neither was a particularly young bride.  Kate met William at university, and apart from a brief split they dated for their entire adult lives. She was 29 on her wedding day. Meghan on the other hand had a whole life, including a successful career and a failed marriage, before she finally met her prince. She was 36 when she said her vows.  Speaking at the wedding reception Like most brides, Kate didn\u0027t stand up and speak at her wedding reception and left it to her father, her new husband and his best man. But Meghan was different, and decided she wanted to say a few words to her friends and her family.  It\u0027s understood the bride thanked the royal family for welcoming her into their lives.  According to the Sun , her speech was very romantic and in it she said: I have found my prince.  Their official wedding photos Meghan\u0027s wedding photos are much less formal than her sister-in-law\u0027s. She\u0027s actually sitting on the floor in one of them, with her beautiful dress flowing out in front of her. Kate and William\u0027s photos look at lot more like traditional wedding photos, taken in Buckingham Palace, with more standing and  Maid of honour Kate had her sister Pippa with her on her big day, and she walked down the aisle with her. Of course, Pippa received quite a lot of attention Meghan on the other hand decided not to have any grown-up bridesmaids or a maid of honour at all.

The evening do is thought to have had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast with a \u0027carnival atmosphere\u0027 being reported in the 230-year-old Frogmore House. As guests arrived at Meghan and Harry\u0027s evening party, they were asked to hand in their phones. No \u0026shyunauthorised videos or pictures were to emerge of the raucous party to end all parties. Only the couple\u0027s \u0027inner circle\u0027 were invited to the Frogmore House knees-up. Looking at every last detail it sounds like they had a great time. Guests feasted on \u0027dirty burgers\u0027, candyfloss and enjoyed drinks-of-the-world themed cocktails - including one named \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, a play on the hit romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally. Meanwhile, prankster Prince William teased Harry over his thinning hair and attached a ladder to the couple\u0027s wedding car in a hilarious royal gag. Here is how Harry and Meghan celebrated in true A-lister style.  1. They drove a Jaguar E-Type to the event Harry drove his new wife from Windsor Castle in a silver blue classic convertible Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero which was originally manufactured in 1968 and has been converted to electric power.  The happy couple waved and smiled as they headed to meet their friends at the celebration, which stretched into the early hours. The car\u0027s number plate bore the date of the wedding (which will, of course, now be their anniversary)- E190518. 2. It was held at Frogmore House The 17th century royal residence stands about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park. It offered the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex the privacy to celebrate their marriage away from the cameras.  The name Frogmore is derived from the frogs which have always lived in the low lying marshy area.It was built in around 1680 by Charles II\u0027s architect and in 1923, the Queen\u0027s parents - the future George VI and Queen Elizabeth - spent part of their honeymoon there. It is only open for people to view on three ticketed charity open days a year, as well to pre-booked groups in August. Guests were welcomed into a glass marquee in the grounds for their sit-down meal. 3. Meghan changed dress  Beautiful bride Meghan switched from her stunning elegant, formal pure white wedding gown by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, to a glamorous lily white halter neck by Stella McCartney for the black tie evening do. Meghan wore shoes from Aquazurra made in silky satin, with nude mesh, with soles painted in baby blue. Her hair - in a relaxed up do - was styled for the reception by George Northwood.   4. James Corden compered the event  Chat show superstar James Corden, who was compering the event, reportedly instigated a dance routine which featured Prince Charles, William and Harry. A source told the Sun: James \u0026shyCorden did his best to entertain and it went down an absolute treat. He even compered a dance-off between Harry, Charles and William. Everyone was laughing because it’s something no one expected. Meghan and her mum also joined in. Then everyone danced, which really kicked off the party. There were rumours that Harry Styles performed - though this hasn\u0027t been confirmed - after he was seen in the area the next morning.  5. Phones were banned It\u0027s reported that the Hollywood stars - and Royal family - were banned from taking mobile phones, though we still saw a few celebs sharing snaps and Instagram stories. Guests were given a special information booklet for the evening event, which had M\u0026ampH at the top. 6. Their closest friends attended The closest friends of the newlyweds were in attendance including Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney and other confidantes such as Benita Litt and designer Misha Nonoo. They mixed with Hollywood\u0027s finest including George and Amal Clooney, Idris Elba and Tom Hardy.  The Suits stars weren\u0027t invited to the event, but had a great time nearby at a karaoke evening. Rachel Renna, a make-up artist for Jessica Mulroney, joined them posting a video of them singing along.  7. Meghan and Harry\u0027s first dance was to Whitney Houston The royal couple chose the Whitney Houston classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the wedding bash. Rather than a traditional dance, they asked guests to join them on the dance floor. One of the 200 guests said: It wasn\u0027t \u0026shytraditional in the slightest. They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop. Meghan had revealed back in 2016 that she saw the tune as her happy song.  8. George Clooney danced with Meghan but was shunned by Fergie Hollywood actor George Clooney, 57, is also reported to have whisked Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge away for a dance. But despite being one of world\u0027s the sexiest men, he did not get his own way with Fergie, who snubbed him when he asked for a quick spin on the dancefloor.  9. Sit-down dinner The black-tie evening party was a sit-down dinner for 200 people. To provide the food, Harry and Meghan hired Clare Smyth, Britain\u0027s top chef and the first woman to hold three Michelin stars. The sit-down dinner was organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. The meal ran from 7.30pm to 10pm. 10. World-themed drinks Guests were told to dress to the nines for a night of old-fashioned glamour and gallons of Pol Roger champagne. A source told the Sun: There was a glass marquee for the dinner, festival-themed stalls and bars outside, with different themed drinks. There was a gin vermouth cocktail created for Charles and Camilla, who are both massive gin fans apparently.  11. Dirty burgers and candyfloss - and a Harry themed cocktail Also on the menu were candyfloss and \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 as midnight snacks, while one source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry\u0027s red hair, named \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027. Dozens of pizza boxes were spotted being hauled into in Windsor Castle on the night of the reception - but it later emerged they were for press accredited crew on the grounds.  12. Drinking games The bride\u0027s US heritage was marked with the American drinking game beer pong, where players throw table tennis balls into cups of beers which their opponents then have to consume, according to reports. A reception insider said Serena Williams played the game like it was tennis. She pulled out all the stops as she dazzled with her second outfit - a luxury designer frock. The tennis champion had already stolen the show during the wedding ceremony in a nude pink asymmetric necklined gown And she did it all again after taking a quick nap with baby daughter Alexis Olympia ahead of tonight\u0027s knees-up.  13. The DJ\u0027s set list - and Idris\u0027 turn on the decks Celebrity DJ Sam Totolee, who was hired by Rod Stewart and Uma Thurman for their wedding receptions, was on the decks. The DJ\u0027s personal website, which lists Kensington Palace as a client, has several testimonials from stars including Diana Ross calling him incredible\u0027 and Uma Thurman saying he is wonderful. The same DJ played at Pippa\u0027s wedding. Actor Idris Elba also took a turn at DJ\u0027ing, with a playlist filled with soul classics, 1960s R\u0026ampB and 1980s dance hits.  The  reported the thud of loud music could be heard over the grounds of Windsor Castle late into the night. Harry picked a set list of his favourite house tracks, so it\u0027s maybe not too surprising. A DJ who slipped his business card to Harry during a visit to Brixton also hinted that it worked and he secured the coveted commission to play at the do. Jevanni Letford posted a photograph Windsor with the caption: Calm before the excitement. 14. Elton John\u0027s turn on the piano At one point a grinning Harry is said to have turned to his guests, asking: \u0027Can anyone play the piano?\u0027 before Sir Elton John gave a moving medley of four hits - Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.  15. Speeches! Meghan and Harry\u0027s romantic words Harry is reported to have told friends: You are the people that make \u0027me\u0027 me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry. Now I’m going to hand over to my far better half… Meghan then gave a speech in which she thanked Prince Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a warm welcome into the royal family.  In Harry\u0027s speech, he said he was looking forward to spending the rest of my life with Meghan. Harry also gave a speech at the earlier reception. He moved guests to tears as he enthused about his beautiful wife, saying: We make such a great team. He is also said to have told Meghan, whose father could not attend the wedding because he was ill, that she navigated everything with such grace. Guest Suhani Jalota, who founded Mumbai charity Myna Mahila Foundation that Meghan visited last year, told Glamour Magazine the prince said: I’m so lucky to call this beautiful woman my wife now. 16. ...and Prince William\u0027s naughty speech But it was brother William, 35, who brought the house down in a joint speech with Harry’s best pal Charlie van Straubenzee.  They teased the groom about his thinning hair and told Meghan she was the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. One guest told the Sun: William managed to strike just the right balance between hilarious and solemn. He did mention their late mother, Princess Diana, and said how proud she would have been of her younger son. He said he was proud of Harry too and welcomed Meghan as the sister he never had and the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. But when he and Charlie got going, it was hilarious. They teased Harry about his growing bald patch and Wills said it would become as bad as his. It was some bash. Jokes about Harry\u0027s playboy past were under a strict embargo - until the older guests had left. It\u0027s reported that Prince William and Harry reference Diana, who harry was said previously would have loved his wife.  17. Prince Charles welcomes Meghan to the family Proud dad Charles gave a speech at the earlier reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle. Talking about the man his son had become, he said: My darling old Harry, I’m so happy for you. He had guests in stitches - including a gag about changing Harry\u0027s nappy - before a spectacular fireworks display. The prince reportedly had guests laughing and crying as he described bringing up the mischievous young Harry.  18. Meghan\u0027s dog attended Meghan made sure her Guy played a part in her big day yesterday. And her beloved beagle proved to be one of the highlights of the night as he entertained wedding reception guests.  The pet pooch had revellers in stitches as he caused chaos, running all over the place lapping up any spilled canapes. Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex, brought Guy to Britain with her last year when she relocated from her home in Toronto. 19. There was a dramatic firework display Later in the evening, there was a firework display seen over the house. Guests finally left around 2am.  20. Harry\u0027s gift to Meghan Prince Harry appears to have given Meghan a emerald cut aquamarine ring which belonged to Diana as a gift. Look at that sparkle!  21. Guests were given slippers Guests were given slippers to wear when their feet were tired from dancing. Actress Troian Bellisario, wife of Meghan\u0027s former on-screen husband Patrick J Adams in Suits, posted on Instagram: How amazing is this? Because these shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. \u0026shySlippers! I’m so ready.

It was not initially clear whether the suspects - two men and two women - had intended setting light to the BH Mallorca Hotel. This afternoon it emerged the incident was looking more like a prank that got out of hand. Civil Guard officers revealed their conclusions in their first official statement on Sunday evening’s incident. An investigating judge will now decide their fate after a court appearance. A spokesman for the Civil Guard, in a statement confirming the arrests of the four Brits, said: “Firefighters, local police and Civil Guard were mobilised on Sunday evening. “Once they reached the hotel they saw flames leaping from one of the rooms via the balcony and saw the blaze was affecting other parts of the complex.  “Realising the lives of people staying at the hotel were in real danger, more than 100 guests in the block affected by the fire were evacuated, the spokesman continued.  “Civil Guard investigators began probing the case of the fire. “After interviewing several witnesses they discovered that in the room where the fire started there were two women and three men, that one of them was asleep and that the other four were bothering him using a lighter and an aerosol on his feet. “Specialists from the Civil Guard Criminalistic Laboratory subsequently confirmed the fire had been started and situated the seat of the fire at the end of the mattress. “The fire completely destroyed one room and affected others.Smoke and fire emerge from a hotel room in Magaluf “Experts are still evaluating the cost but it will be in excess of 200,000 euros because of the repair work, cleaning and losses that will be caused by rooms being out of action and possible compensation that will need to be paid to those holidaymakers affected by the fire.” The suspects are yet to go before a judge who is expected to decide in a closed court hearing whether to remand them in custody or release them on bail.

Prince William joined families of the victims of the Manchester Arena terror attack who were remembered at an emotional national commemoration service to mark its first anniversary. There were tears in many eyes as the city observed a minute\u0027s silence to commemorate those who were killed. The order of service listed the 22 names of those who lost their lives with the heading In our hearts forever. The Duke of Cambridge attended a service at Manchester Cathedral alongside Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The prince was greeted with cheers as he arrived at the service where he met dignitaries and religious leaders outside the cathedral. Hundreds of floral tributes have been laid in the city to mark the first anniversary of the horror. Many were adorned with the image of a bee that became a symbol of defiance in the face of the tragedy.  The Dean of Manchester, Rogers Govender, opened the service of remembrance, saying: In this service we come together as people of different faiths and none, as we remember with love before God those whose lives were lost, and those whose lives have been changed forever and have to live with the terrible memories of that day 12 months ago. There is a land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge between them is love: the only survival, the only meaning. Schoolchildren George Herbert and Remsha Asif read a poem entitled For Lost Friends - and the Halle Youth Choir then sang a rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.  The Duke of Cambridge read a Bible passage from the book of Corinthians. He said: For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three and the greatest of these is love.  Thousands of messages of support on cardboard tags have also been attached by members of the public to 28 Japanese maple trees which form the Trees of Hope trail from St Ann\u0027s Square to Victoria rail and tram station. Among the notes were messages which read: Thinking of you all, stay strong xxx, Manchester we stand together. Forever in our hearts, and: As a clever bishop said \u0027there is power in love\u0027. Another message read: RIP to all you beautiful angels who have all gained their wings in such a horrific vile way. Manchester will not cower away to you monsters. Spread love. Stacie xx  More than 7,000 handmade stitched hearts are also dotted around the city centre with people encouraged to smile on the day and take them as they pass as part of social media campaign #aheart4mcr. The massacre on May 22 last year claimed 22 innocent lives when suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device in the lobby of the Manchester Arena following an Ariana Grande concert. Hundreds more were injured or left with devastating psychological trauma. Prince William met some of the bereaved families in private after the cathedral ceremony.  The bombing - the worst terror attack on UK soil since the July 2005 London underground bombings - left more than 800 injured. Ariana Grande released an emotional message of support ahead of the anniversary. She wrote: Thinking of you all today and every day. I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was a day to come together, tweeting: Today ... we remember each of the 22 people whose lives were taken \u0026amp we re-commit to supporting their families \u0026amp all affected.  Members of the public could watch proceedings at the invite-only cathedral ceremony on a big screen in nearby Cathedral Gardens, while the service was also screened at York Minster, Liverpool politan Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral.

Moments earlier thousands had defiantly sung Oasis track Don\u0027t Look Back in Anger in a huge show of solidarity. The city\u0027s Albert Square was packed with people as a concert, called Manchester Together - With One Voice, was held on the anniversary of the atrocity. Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher appeared on a big screen to introduce the track, which became an anthem of defiance after the attack at the Manchester Arena last year. Those gathered in the square also sang One Last Time by Ariana Grande, who was performing on the night the bombing happened. The star herself posted a tweet voicing her regret that she was not there in person, but said she loves Manchester.    At 10.31pm, bells rang out from buildings across the city centre to mark the moment when the attack happened 12 months ago. It was followed by loud applause in the square. On an emotional night, messages were also screened from Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Manchester United hero Ryan Giggs.  A choir made from police, fire and ambulance officers performed a moving version of Bridge Over Troubled Water at the concert this evening, the Manchester Evening News reports.  And members of the Manchester Survivors Choir, comprised of people who were in the music venue when the bomb went off, also took to the stage to loud cheers. Before they sang Rise Up by Andra Day, choir member Cath Hill told the audience: We are showing Manchester and the world that we carry on.  It is so important for us to be together. We are here to look after each other, care for each other and to be positive and move forward. Poet Tony Walsh returned to Albert Square where last May he read his poem This Is The Place at the public vigil to widespread acclaim. After an earlier minute\u0027s silence, Walsh encouraged the crowd to make a minute\u0027s noise for the 22, those injured in the blast, for the first responders, NHS staff involved in the care of those affected and for Manchester and its spirit and its amazing people. As the crowd of up to 15,000 people responded, Walsh shouted: This is what love sounds like. You can\u0027t stop the sound of love. A mass 30-minute communal singalong finale brought the event to a crescendo with performances of Don\u0027t Look Back In Anger by Oasis, One Day Like This by Elbow, Grande\u0027s One Last Time, Never Forget by Take That and finally The Beatles\u0027 All You Need Is Love. Earlier today Prince William, Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn attended a service of remembrance at Manchester Cathedral to pay their respects to the victims.  Former football star Giggs said: Manchester is a city of music and is a city of love, and we are sending out love and prayers on this emotional day. Mani from The Stone Roses said: One voice Manchester. Sing it up. While Liam Fray, of The Courteeners, said: We are a proud city of love and I will be thinking of each and every one of you on this very emotional and very difficult day.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first royal event as a married couple saw Harry pay a moving tribute to the Prince of Wales for his charitable work over more than four decades.  But during the emotional the speech a bee buzzed close to Harry, causing him to become distracted and apologise. As he paused to say sorry for the interruption, he explained that bee really got me. Meghan and the Duchess of Cornwall broke into a fit of giggles, sharing a joke with Prince Charles over the situation.  Harry tried to keep his composure and continued with his speech. In Charles\u0027 70th year, the Duke described how his dad\u0027s tireless efforts championing causes like heritage and vulnerable young people had inspired him and his brother. Speaking in Buckingham Palace\u0027s garden, he added that the prince had also influenced many of the 6,500 guests, on the lawns of the Queen\u0027s official home, representing 386 of the prince\u0027s patronages, and 18 of his military affiliations. With his father standing behind him Harry said: It is your selfless drive to affect change, whether that is to improve the lives of those who are on the wrong path, to save an important piece of our national heritage or to protect a particular species under threat, which William and I draw inspiration from every day.   Charles, who will be 70 in November, played an impromptu role in Saturday\u0027s royal wedding accompanying Meghan down the aisle in the absence of her own father who was unable to attend after having heart surgery.  As Prince Charles\u0027 is heir to the throne his 70th is a big event for the royal family - so much so, he gets several celebrations. More than 6,000 guests representing organisations supported by Prince Charles are in the gardens at Buckingham Palace this afternoon.

The exact dates of Ramadan change every year, because Islam uses a lunar calendar and because lunar months are shorter than the solar months used elsewhere. For Muslims who are fasting, this means when Ramadan falls during the summer months, Iftar (breaking of the fast) falls much later in the day - which in turn  Muslims observing Ramadan will also pray five times a day.  This, together with the physical and mental demands of fasting, mean employers need to be aware of how they can help their staff who are observing the holy month.   Speaking to MirrorOnline Jonathan Carr, partner at Lewis Silkin , reveals your rights when fasting and praying at work during Ramadan.   1. Are employees allowed to take time away from work to pray? Not allowing employees a reasonable opportunity to pray during the working day is likely to amount to unlawful discrimination.  All workers are entitled to a break of at least 20 minutes anyway if their working day exceeds 6 hours. Employers should be flexible if the employee wants to take their break at a particular time in order to pray. If the employee wants to take additional prayer breaks, a common solution is to ask them to make up the time but if additional breaks are tolerated for smokers or others without needing to make up time, not exercising that discretion similarly for religious observance could land the employer on the wrong side of the law.  In some circumstances the employer may be able to push back, for instance where the proposed frequency or timing of the prayer breaks would cause significant operational disruption on a production line. 2. Can employees ask employers for space to pray in the workplace or is this up to the employee? Employers are not obliged to provide rooms for prayer but where a quiet space is available and allowing this to be used for prayer does not cause problems for others, the employer should agree.  Refusing such a request could amount to unlawful discrimination, particularly where an existing space is unused and could easily be designated for this purpose. Where the request would involve significant cost or inconvenience to others (for instance converting a bathroom or kitchen facility) the employer will obviously need to weigh up the competing considerations more carefully. If a space can be designated for quiet prayer it is important this is made available to employees of all religions though. Reserving the facility for one faith is likely to result in claims as much as unreasonably refusing a request in the first place.   3. Because fasting for long, warm days during Ramadan can impact on work, do workers have the right to request to work from home or start the day earlier?  Yes, as with prayer opportunities and facilities, the key is for employers to offer some reasonable flexibility. If temporary changes to working hours or arrangements won’t cause significant problems then the employer should consider allowing them. It may also benefit the employer if this helps the employee to stay fresh and productive.

Rania Ibrahim, 31, is among the latest victims to be commemorated at the Grenfell Inquiry which began yesterday - with tributes also paid this morning to a wife who died seven months after the blaze and an opera worker who always had a smile on her face\u0027. Ms Ibrahim live-streamed her final moments from the top of the burning building - where she was trapped with her young daughters Fethia, four, and Hania, three. This morning Rasha Ibrahim said in a statement read to the inquiry: It has been so hard. After that terrible night came a cruel time of false hope and rumours. I came here thinking I would be able to lay my loved ones to rest, but there were then months of uncertainty before they were identified and buried. To this day, the questions remain in my mind and plague me about what exactly happened - it is very important for me to take part in this process of questioning, to find out the truth.  It is so important for me to understand how I have lost Rania, my beloved sister, while my children, who are still so young, have lost their little cousins - I cannot lay them to rest yet. Tributes were paid today to 74-year-old Maria del Pilar Burton, widely considered to be the 72nd victim of the June 14 blaze. Mrs Burton\u0027s health deteriorated badly following the blaze, her husband of 34 years, Nicholas Burton, said. Also known as Pily, she was diagnosed with dementia in 2015 and suffered great distress after her home was incinerated on June 14 last year. Mr Burton remembered his wife with warmth and humour on the second day of the inquiry, but said the fire had changed everything. He told the hearing at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel in South Kensington: The trauma had a terrible effect on Pily\u0027s dementia. She was very distressed.  Mr Burton too was forced to undergo life-saving surgery in the wake of the fire due to an enlarged heart. His wife\u0027s condition had worsened by the time he emerged and she suffered a stroke in January. She never recovered, and died on January 29. He said: She was a unique, beautiful, exceptional person until this tragedy had taken it away. It took away her dignity and everything we had in this world. And let me tell you, no matter what indiginities my wife had to suffer, my Pily was perfect. And tributes were also paid to Deborah Lamprell, 45, who died in the fire. Ms Lamprell, known as Debbie, was described by her mother Miriam as a happy and fulfilled woman who loved being around people. In a statement read out by Ms Lamprell\u0027s Opera Holland Park colleague, Michael Volpe, she spoke of her guilt at encouraging her daughter to move into a council block where she thought she would be safe.  She moved out of the family home as a young professional to be nearer her work in west London, her mother said, adding that she was concerned about the bedsits she was living in. She said: The conditions weren\u0027t good and I used to badger her to put her name down with the council to get her somewhere proper to live, somewhere safe and decent. Of course it feels terrible to have done that now because she was given the flat in Grenfell. The night she died, Ms Lamprell sent a text to say she was safe at home, her mother said, which read: I\u0027ve got in, mum, all\u0027s well, goodnight, god bless.

For generations of families, it was the first choice for quality, whether that was dresses, suits, socks or, of course, undies. Yet for many customers, Marks has long since lost its sparkle. Dowdy stores, drab clothes and fashion flops have seen shoppers shun the chain. It was late to launch online and has been playing catch-up ever since. M\u0026ampS’s market share has nearly halved in the past two decades and it risks being overtaken by budget chain Primark this year. The firm may be demoted from the FTSE list of Britain’s biggest firms next week. I’ve listened to plenty of promised M\u0026ampS fightback plans over the years – and they have all failed to deliver on the hype.  But under boss Steve Rowe and chairman Archie Norman, it may have its best hope yet. But it means ripping the heart out of high streets across the country and deserting the very customers who have stayed loyal. The very real danger is that, once M\u0026ampS goes, it sends shockwaves through the wider area and leads to even more store closures.

The Duke of Sussex appeared to be close to tears as the 600 people in St George\u0027s Chapel sang the final bars of Guide me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was his mother\u0027s favourite hymn and was sung at her funeral. But the official wedding photos, released by Kensington Palace on Monday, also pay tribute to his mother, who died 21 years ago.  The photographs feature their family members, including the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the bride\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland .  But there was also a special detail missed by many.  In the second photo the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex are surrounded by their page boys and bridesmaids. While Meghan sits on the floor of the Green Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, Harry sits on an emerald green couch, a couch that he sat on once before in another photograph marking an important milestone in his life. The couch was the same couch in which Harry’s late mother was photographed sitting on while holding a baby Harry at his christening in 1984. Diana sat beside the Queen, while Prince Harry\u0027s dad Charles rested on the arm of the antique furniture. In the middle of the photo was Prince William in a white polo shirt and blue shorts.  Last year Harry admitted in a TV documentary he had only cried twice about his mother\u0027s death in a car crash in Paris, an event which shocked the world. He said: The first time I cried was at the funeral on the island, referring to Diana\u0027s private burial at Althorp. And only since then, maybe once more. There\u0027s a lot of grief that still needs to be... to be let out. There were touching references to Harry\u0027s late mother throughout the ceremony.

Whitney Martin, 18, believed she simply had a cold when she became bed-ridden with flu-like symptoms three weeks ago. Her condition, however, worsened and on May 4 she was rushed to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shrops, after her illness began attacking her vital organs. Just 24 hours later, she was placed in intensive care at a Manchester hospital after suffering heart failure and \u0027technically dying twice\u0027 on the operating table.  Whitney has since been left in an induced coma, relying on two life support machines and has been diagnosed with sepsis and myocardiopathy - a disorder of the heart muscle. Her mum Suzanne, 38, has been forced to quit her job as a support worker in order to care for her daughter who is receiving around-the-clock hospital care. The mother-of-two, who is now living in a bungalow for transplant patients on the hospital site to be close to her daughter, said: It all started about three weeks ago when she had a cold. It was usual flu-like conditions such as tiredness and being hot and cold and we thought she was just being a bit of a drama queen.  She was a fit and healthy girl and we never expected what was to come next as she was such an outgoing girl. On the Friday, her blood pressure was too low and her temperature was sky high and I took one look at her and knew I had to get her to a hospital. She had been due to start a job as a waitress at one of our local pubs the next day. Within 24 hours her condition completely deteriorated and they wanted to transfer her to Birmingham by air ambulance for specialist care because they thought she was going to die. The didn\u0027t have any beds so she went by land ambulance to Manchester. She went straight into intensive care as she suffered heart failure. Her heart stopped twice, she technically died twice on the operating table and she only had a 50/50 chance of survival.   Whitney was placed in a BiVAD machine, an implantable pump designed to help the heart function better when both sides of the organ are failing.   She was also hooked up to an ECMO machine, which uses an artificial lung to oxygenate the blood outside the body.   Although her condition is life-threatening, her family remain hopeful she can pull through after she started showing signs of recovery this week.     Suzanne, who lives with partner Kevin Davidson, 42, a lorry driver, and her son Luis, 20, added: It has just been a living hell and every mother\u0027s worst nightmare.    But she is now off one of the machines after her heart started working independently of the BiVAD machine, which the consultant had said is a small miracle.    We are just hoping for the best now, she has picked up but I could still potentially be here another six, nine or 12 months until after Christmas they are telling me.    The doctors and nurses have just been amazing and I cannot thank them enough for what they have done for Whitney so far.   We are just praying she carries on fighting because we\u0027ve always said Whitney cannot live without me and I can\u0027t live without Whitney - she is my little mini me.    Her grandmother Wendy Burford, said: As a family we\u0027re living day-by-day as everything is now down to chance.    It has been such a shock to everyone as Whitney was so young and full of life.    We are remaining hopeful that Whitney will pull through and wake up soon.    Of course, we want to do as much as we can to help family members who want to visit and support Whitney and make regular visits.    Her mother, Susan, has been so strong throughout it all.   She\u0027s had to give up her job in order to care for and visit Whitney in hospital. Manchester is quite a way and affording to travel on a regular basis is tiring and very expensive.

The snazzy E-type, which has been converted to an electric vehicle, used to belong to Jamiroquai musician Toby Grafftey-Smith, who died last year the age of 46 after a six-year battle with cancer. His widow, Gabriella Crewe-Read, told the Daily Mail: The royal wedding car was bought from Toby. His brilliance is everywhere. She added that her late husband is \u0027still here\u0027. Like Jamiroquai frontman and petrolhead Jay Kay, Grafftey-Smith was a classic car enthusiast and owned the 50-year-old Jag. Jay Kay himself has starred on Top Gear and is famous for his selection of luxury cars.    After his death it was sold by his widow, although Crewe-Read has not revealed who bought it - although the keys have now found their way into royal hands. The keyboard player was an alumnus of Marlborough College, the \u0026pound36,525-per-year boarding school where the Duchess of Cambridge was educated. The car was prepared for the much-anticipated wedding by giving it a new registration plate - the date on which Harry and Meghan tied the knot.  The car is a zero-emissions, battery-electric-powered version of the 1968 car with LED head lamps. Built between 1961 and 1975, the E-Type was described by Enzo Ferrari as ‘the most beautiful car in the world’. This model is said to be worth \u0026pound350,000.

As well as providing for children Mark, 54, Shaun, 48 and Amanda, 44, the Sheffield United fans funded army veterans’ reunion trips. Barbara quit as a hospital support worker and Ray as a building firm supervisor and they did splash out on a house on a posh estate.

Jan Mai, 50, was detained by German police on Friday after the body of Irina Aizina was found on Wednesday. The 29-year-old mother-of-one, originally from Moldova, had been stabbed up to 20 times and mutilated beyond recognition. The chilling discovery was made by a dog walker at a Frankfurt park.  The pair hit the headlines earlier this year when Mr. Mai claimed his nightclub venue \u0027First\u0027 had been attacked by up to “50 Arab” men during New Year\u0027s Eve 2016, The Daily Beast reported. The men had raided the venue and had groped the hostesses before making off with their jackets, according to Mai\u0027s account of events. Ms Aizina had been interview by journalists in relation to the alleged attack and backed up Mr. Mai\u0027s claims. She said she had been groped everywhere“ and had said she was “lucky she had been wearing tights.”  The accusations echoed a spate of sexual assaults in central Cologne on December 31, 2015. The disclosure left many Germans shocked following a government decision to grant asylum to up to one million refugees the previous year.  Mai\u0027s revelations further exacerbated tensions in the country and led to a headline by German\u0027s right-leaning publication Bild, with the headline “Sex Mob Rages on Frankfurt Restaurant Strip.” “They streamed inside here,” Mai said. “They put on the jackets of the guests and marched outside with the jackets. They grabbed the girls from behind.” Investigating authorities soon grew suspicious particularly after it was revealed Aizina had been celebrating New Year in Belgrade at the time. Charges were later filed by police against the pair for falsely reporting a crime. Authorities claimed that the two had simply made up the incident to garner publicity for their struggling nightclub.

The action kicks off at 6.30pm and entry is free.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united stick by crocked keeper mehmet","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have offered crocked keeper Deniz Mehmet the chance to stay with them as he battles for fitness next season.The 25-year-old suffered a serious knee problem when he picked up a bizarre injury in the Premiership play-off quarter-final victory over Dunfermline at Tannadice earlier this month.He suffered knee ligament damage as he jumped in delight to celebrate Scott McDonald’s equaliser early in the second half of the second leg that United went on to win 2-1.With the one-year contract he signed when joining up from Falkirk last summer up at the end of the month, that put a question mark over his future with the Tangerines.But manager Csaba Laszlo is sticking by the man he made No 1 late in the season.He has been told a new deal is waiting for him to sign.Even if the former Turkish youth international decides his long-term future lies elsewhere, United will see he is put through his operation and provide the facilities for him to complete his rehab programme.That process is likely to take until the end of the year at least but he did enough in 13 first-team games this season for United to be more than happy to keep him.With the other first-team goalie, Harry Lewis, returning to parent club Southampton at the end of his season-long loan, at least one of the as many as 17 signings made this summer will be an experienced No 1.Meanwhile, the latest discount period for season tickets for the 2018/19 campaign comes to an end tomorrow and fans have until then to secure their books at a reduced price.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b02997cb623e-651x564.jpg ","title":"first dundee start is just the beginning for young keeper calum ferrie","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee goalie Calum Ferrie says getting his first start at senior level was a massive confidence boost – now he’s looking to use that to springboard a successful career at Dens Park.The 19-year-old, signed from Port Vale two years ago, impressed manager Neil McCann enough to see him made second-choice behind Elliott Parish, despite the signing of Jeremy Malherbe in January.That brought a debut at Ibrox in April after Parish was hurt late on before Ferrie was rewarded with a new contract and then his first start on the final day of the season.That ended in frustration for the Dark Blues as they were beaten 1-0 by Partick Thistle after a limp performance and left Ferrie “annoyed” that his hopes of keeping a clean sheet had been dashed.He said: “The result wasn’t what we wanted and we could have done better.“However, on a personal note it was a great achievement to play and I feel I did alright.“It was a good confidence booster for myself to get that full start under my belt, I really enjoyed it.“It’s always frustrating as a keeper because you can’t really influence the play in front of you.“That’s just the life of the goalkeeper – it can be a lonely position. Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers. I’m 6ft 1in but it doesn’t matter, you just have to be dominant and you get yourself out for crosses.“I’ve always tried to do that because I always think if you attack it 100% you can get there even if they are six foot seven or eight.“If you want that ball more than them then you can go get it.”His displays in training and for the successful U/20 side, saw him handed another year’s deal by Dundee and Ferrie is determined to make the most of the chance he’s been given.He added: “It was good to get that signed, get secure for next year knowing I can come back and work 100% again to make sure that gets me as far as I can go.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9b7427711-e1526642317159-877x564.jpg ","title":"highly rated dundee

however, as he was caught on the knee by Accies midfielder Darian MacKinnon, who hurt himself in the process.Curran, meanwhile, was a real stand-out for the U/20s all season as they finished second in

boost","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have been handed an early fitness boost for next season by the return to action of James Keatings.The attacker delayed his summer break to take part in youth coach Dave Bowman’s charity match against a team of fans at Tannadice on Friday night.It was the first time since January he’d kicked a ball in anger and leaves him on course to be ready for the start of pre-season training next month.The man who won promotion from the Championship with Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs was seen as a key signing when he joined after leaving the Hibees last summer.However, the first season of a two-year deal was ruined by a catalogue of injuries.Early in the campaign he was sidelined by an ankle problem and he hasn’t played since being forced out by a groin condition in January.That led to surgery but, in recent weeks, he has been building his fitness and has now reached the stage where he can resume playing.Also turning out for the United greats team on Friday was Craig Easton, with whom talks over a youth coaching role at Tannadice are continuing.Easton taking charge of the development of the club’s young talent remains very much on the cards.The 39-year-old was himself a product of United’s youth policy and went on to make more than 200 appearances for the club before continuing his career with Livingston and then a string of lower division clubs south of the border.Once his playing days were over, he did some coaching in England and, for the past two years, has been in charge of the youths at Raith Rovers. United, meanwhile, are continuing to hold talks with a long list of signing targets for next term.Dunfermline pair Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird could be fixed up this week.And Celtic youngster Sam Wardrop is also expected to join what will be a new-look squad.The 20-year-old played against United last season during a loan spell at Dumbarton that saw him make 27 appearances.United now know all the teams they will be facing in the Championship next season after Partick Thistle’s relegation was confirmed when they went down to Livingston in the Premiership play-off final.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"simon murray proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

artwork","story":"\u0026nbspAN alternative artwork to replace the controversial tilting pier concept proposed for the banks of the River Ness will be showcased at a public exhibition next week.Designs, to be displayed at Inverness Town House on May 24, have thrilled councillors who have had a peek at an international architect\u0027 new offering.The images are being kept under wraps for now. But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed. It\u0027 enhancing.\"People will be happy with it because they\u0026rsquove heeded public opinion.\"They\u0026rsquove taken the key aspects of the best features of the River Ness \u0026ndash its shape, the salmon fishing, the popularity of it. It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council.
