She said that “racism is a factor” in the criticism the duchess has faced since marrying Prince Harry.“I think it’s more deeply embedded in people’s consciousness than any of us are willing to admit,” said Mantel. “So I hesitate to call her a victim but I think there has been an element of racism in the invective against her.”Harry and Meghan will stop representing the Queen and become financially independent on 31 March. The decision followed what the prince described as a campaign of bullying by the British tabloid press against his wife, “a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son”.Mantel, whose novel Bring Up the Bodies depicted the downfall of Anne Boleyn, as engineered by Cromwell, said there was “still an intense concentration on the bodies of royal women”.“We only have to look at what happens when our royal ladies give birth,” said the novelist. “They are perceived as public property in the same way that Tudor women were perceived. It is simply turning the inidual woman back into a breeder.”Mantel’s comments echo her 2013 lecture at the British Museum, during which she said Kate Middleton appeared to have been “designed by a committee and built by craftsmen, with a perfect plastic smile and the spindles of her limbs hand-turned and gloss-varnished”.“These days, she is a mother-to-be, and draped in another set of threadbare attributions. Once she gets over being sick, the press will find that she is radiant. They will find that this young woman’s life until now was nothing, her only point and purpose being to give birth,” said Mantel, in a speech later described as “venomous” and “bitter” by the Daily Mail, and as “completely misguided and completely wrong” by David Cameron.Mantel pointed out that this was taking her comments out of context, saying: “My lecture and the subsequent essay was actually supportive of the royal family and when I used those words about the Duchess of Cambridge, I was describing the perception of her which has been set up in the tabloid press”.“I don’t believe for one moment that there was any lack of clarity, after all, I have been practising my trade for a number of years now,” said the novelist at the time. “It was a matter of taking the words completely out of context – twisting the context – and setting me up as a hate figure. I have absolutely no regrets. What I said was crystal clear.”The Mirror on the Light, concluding Mantel’s Wolf Hall trilogy, is published on Thursday, and has already been longlisted for the Women’s prize. The novelist told the BBC she would be delighted if it brought her an unprecedented third Booker prize. “Oh yes,” she said, asked if she’d like to win again. “Who wouldn’t?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7aa0c731080ec4c7ed7eb846df17501b3765bca/0_125_5616_3368/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0399f1c436a7b633bfda3f4ecdb3299b","title":"uk supermarkets braced for stockpiling if coronavirus escalates panic buying","story":"Plans would help with panic-buying brought on by escalation of coronavirus outbreakBritish supermarkets have drawn up “feed the nation” contingency plans that would help the country cope with any panic-buying brought on by a sudden escalation of the coronavirus outbreak.Under the plans, supermarkets would work with suppliers to scale back the variety of foods and groceries available, and instead focus on maintaining supplies of staple products.Details of the strategy in place to ensure uninterrupted food supplies came as Boris Johnson is set to unveil “battle plans” today for tackling a potential outbreak, expected to include steps to limit the spread within crowds and to older, more vulnerable people.“The most important thing now is that we prepare against a possible very significant expansion of coronavirus in the UK population and that is clearly on the cards,” the prime minister told the BBC on Monday. Matthew Hancock, the health secretary, said that Britain may follow the lead of “European countries at more advanced stages of an outbreak,” adding: “All options are on the table.”The supermarket contingency plans were detailed by a City analyst, Bruno Monteyne, of investment firm Alliance Bernstein. Monteyne was previously a supply chain director at Tesco.Monteyne said a major outbreak of the virus could result in “panic buying, empty shelves and food riots.” However, he added that retailers have “ready-made plans” to deal with disruption and move to “feed-the-nation” status.“Yes, it will be chaotic (and expect pictures of empty shelves),” he wrote in a note to investors, “but the industry will reduce complexity to keep the country fed.” Monteyne’s note said Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket chain, has practised “multiday simulation” exercises, including mocked-up news coverage, with different teams preparing responses to a flu pandemic. Tesco confirmed it carried out such preparations and said they were part of being a “responsible retailer.”Monteyne said supermarkets and their suppliers would work together to agree “a major reduction in ranges” so that suppliers can run their plants more efficiently. He added the big grocers were likely “to be drawing up lists right now of which products will be prioritised”.He said he did not expect prices to rise because “food retailers cannot be seen to be profiteering at a moment of crisis”. However, he warned the disruption could cost the sector £1.2bn in lost profits.Monteyne added that in the event of acute food shortages he expected the army to be called in “to protect depots, food trucks and stores” and that all grocers and suppliers would start working together.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to\u0026nbspmore than 60 other countries. The worst affected include South Korea with nearly 5,000 cases, and Iran, with over 1,500 cases.There have been\u0026nbsp40 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.Several of the big food retailers reported signs of panic buying. A senior executive at one major grocer told the  it was witnessing stockpiling of bottled water, core grocery lines such as tinned food and pasta, and cleaning products.The British online supermarket Ocado has advised customers to place orders further in advance than usual because of “exceptionally high demand”. It said: “More people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders.” Members of the department for environment, food and rural affairs’ Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group is expected to meet this week to discuss how to limit the impact of coronavirus.The group links key food and drink firms and the National Farmers’ Union with government departments to deal with any potential disruption to food supplies, such as that which could have followed a no deal Brexit last year.Defra said in a statement that the group “can be convened in the event of an emergency response situation, linking together the food industry and central government civil contingencies activity to swiftly mitigate any issues and ensure a healthy and varied supply of food”.Consumers have also been stocking up with frozen food, according to supermarket Iceland. Managing director Nigel Broadhurst said it has had more shoppers in its stores, spending significantly more than normal. “Sales of frozen food have seen notable increases and we have noticed a trend towards customers selecting multibuy deals and larger packs.”Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-op convenience chain refused to comment on stockpiling, and said only that they were seeing more demand for cleaning products and hand sanitisers.But a senior executive at one of the UK’s main supermarkets said: “All the big supermarkets have a plan B for sourcing.” Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, also said there had been an increase in demand for hand sanitisers and other hygiene products and that availability of products remained good.He added:“Retailers are working closely with their suppliers and monitoring consumer behaviour to anticipate changes in future demand.”Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said his organisation was “in regular dialogue with the government and its agencies on how the food and drink industry should react to the spread of Covid-19.“At this stage, supply chains have experienced disruption but there is no evidence of significant disruption to food supplies. UK food and drink manufacturers have robust procedures in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9da7e6a1b1199a90e0a043d01bb272ac2222f7/0_147_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=420468c9f46537c1bfd3609f030fcaa6","title":"barclays under investor pressure over fossil fuel stance","story":" Jupiter Asset Management to back campaign resolution calling for halt to investmentBarclays is facing increasing pressure over its environmental stance after one of its top 25 investors came out in favour of a shareholder resolution urging the bank to stop lending to fossil fuel companies.It ratchets up the pressure on Barclays to phase out services to fossil fuel companies that fail to align with Paris climate goals, amid concerns about Barclays role as Europe’s largest financier of fossil fuel companies.The Church of England’s investment arm, Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi, and the largest UK pension fund by members, Nest, have also declared plans to back the resolution, which has been spearheaded by campaign group ShareAction.Jupiter Asset Management’s head of governance and sustainability Ashish Ray said: “As investors, we expect boards and management teams to maintain a long-term mindset and appropriately manage key risks to their business.

Mass incarcerations, torture and the longest digital siege ever imposed in a democracy mean that daily life for most Kashmiris has now become a dire struggle.The purpose of these rent-a-diplomat tours is to shore up a narrative of normalcy in Kashmir. But as I saw images of carefully choreographed meetings with officials, spooks, businessmen and newly birthed political stooges, I thought of other places of interest that the delegates might be persuaded to see, should they or others like them visit again.Since I happen to know Srinagar – the city of my birth and youth – probably slightly better than, let’s say, the visiting French envoy and his handlers, I suggest you start in the immediate vicinity of the majestic palace-turned-hotel where the international delegates – brought in to see Kashmiris, with their own eyes, no less – were forced to stay.Take a short walk around the hills here and you could take photos of a gorgeously redecorated building known as Papa II or Fairview. This was one of the most notorious torture centres where detained Kashmiris – suspected of involvement in insurgency against Indian rule – were subjected to unspeakable torture in the 1990s. It has since been redecorated and turned into an official residence where Kashmir’s last chief minister lived. A few echoes of those tormented inside might ring faintly, but what’s a postcard-pretty, old villa without fitting sound effects?Not too far from there, you could visit the beautifully appointed guesthouses and hotels in which various species of Kashmiri politician have been kept as grumpy guests of the state. They won’t talk freely, as it’s kind of illegal in Kashmir, but, hey, those codes of modern democracy and freedom of speech, as practised in Berlin or Paris (and sometimes in Delhi), need not apply to an indigenous people in a faraway mountainous region.If you like your medieval towns full of exotic charms, a quick detour into the Martyr’s Graveyard of Srinagar – where a cross-section of those slain by India’s armed forces over the years are buried – could get you face-to-face with lots of Arabesque gravestones. You must recite Rumi here.Just a few minutes from the Dal Lake, where you grudgingly had to take photos as you reclined in the traditional Kashmiri water taxi, you could go on a historical walk in the labyrinths of the old city. Here you could embark on a tour of the families who have lost their boys and girls to Indian bullets over the years. But if seeing memorial rooms of loss and death so soon after selfies at an idyllic lake isn’t your cup of tea, you could speak to living victims, those who have dark holes in place of eyes. Please note that it might be rude to ask your hosts how and why these kids were blinded. In the photos posted by a news agency which is known for its alacrity in reporting lovely things for the state, one couldn’t see any common Kashmiris. But worry not, the next time you go, you could ask your local fixers to find a funeral and join in with prayers for the soul of the departed. To see ordinary Kashmiris, of all shapes, sizes, and ages, you need not even visit Kashmir. Many are scattered across north Indian prisons – most have not been charged, and do not have robust legal aid – providing a real chance to talk to people in their natural habitat.You must then visit the only psychiatric hospital in Srinagar. Here you can find your average distressed native anywhere you look, as the incidence of deep trauma among us has risen because of the long siege of our earthly paradise. Previously, only one in two Kashmiris suffered from some form of post-traumatic stress disorder now, you will have to politely ask your hosts, who imposed the siege six months ago, about the curve of that statistic.The envoys might deserve some credit for their assiduous devotion to the great Indian democracy roadshow. It’s not the first time that European diplomatics in India have made themselves useful on the Kashmir front. In 2013, the then German ambassador, Michael Steiner, put on a concert for the conductor Zubin Mehta in a picturesque garden on the shores of Dal Lake. We were told it was to bring peace and harmony to the people of Kashmir. Attended mainly by spooks, bureaucrats, officials, politicians and a few fawning journalists, the concert ended up resembling a dark skit straight out of a war comedy: hours before the concert a motorist was shot and wounded for failing to obey orders to stop. Meanwhile in south Kashmir, four Kashmiris were killed by Indian paramilitaries, as the invitation-only guests listened to rhapsodic orchestral music in a walled garden surrounded by soldiers with semi-automatic weapons.Tourist envoys have occasionally visited Kashmir to examine, ascertain and report on we are told, what Kashmiris really want, despite Kashmiris having for years written in blood that they want azadi, to self-determine their destiny. As one is unable to compute how boatloads of foreign and Indian delegates are going to help, one is compelled to conclude that it may just be a good old freebie, a fully paid trip to one of the most beautiful places on the planet.It doesn’t matter that Kashmiris have been subject to conquistadorial silencing, to surveillance that brings to mind the Stasi, to torture and mass incarceration, suppression of assembly, a draconian internet shutdown, the crushing of their free press, the devastation of their economy, the crippling of the education system, the criminalisation of speech (those who’ve been set free have literally had to sign “bonds of silence”) and the gagging of their civil society.It doesn’t matter that the natives are being punished en masse. You can always keep them out of the frame, as a young Afghan counsel to India gleefully did during the latest PR expedition, when he told reporters: “Everything is normal and alright here.

It doesn’t matter that everyone in Kashmir knows this is a state-crafted sojourn.

She chose the word carefully, to convey a mix of rarity and alchemy. What Lee seemingly didn’t anticipate was that just a few years later it would have become a flagrant misnomer: these days there’s nothing rare about unicorns.According to website Crunchbase, 142 new companies met the criteria in 2019, taking the herd size to over 500. They’ve got a combined worth of more than $2tn, which is bigger than the gross domestic product of countries such as Canada and Italy, and their heft is perhaps the most striking indicator of our global economy’s return to absolute and unmitigated exuberance.It might seem odd to the majority of us, who are used to stagnating wages and an increasingly dilapidated public realm, but businesses are actually flooded with cash. Squeezed by years of rock-bottom interest rates, investors have been on a desperate hunt for assets that offer a yield above zero, throwing money at every conceivable candidate.Globally, more than half of outstanding government debt offers a negative yield – which is to say that many investors now have to pay for the privilege of lending money to states, where they at least know their assets will most likely be safe. But even corporations, which have more of a chance of defaulting, have been able to issue bonds with yields below zero, because the interest that their debt offers is marginally higher – or less negative, if you will – than the interest on other assets.So how did the rules of the economy get turned on their head like this? Interest rates were initially cut in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis, in order to kickstart economic recovery. But in the absence of any real growth to speak of, they’ve been stuck there ever since. The result is both cheap borrowing and lots of lending.Against this background – too much cash and too few places to put it – investors have been easily seduced by the bright lights and shiny things of Silicon Valley, where a growth-at-all-costs mentality trumps such antiquated and pedestrian metrics as profitability. Why invest in a plain old low-risk government bond or mundane index that offers – at most – a sliver of return, when you could take a punt on a super-innovative startup? Obviously the downside risk is substantial, but the prospect of having spotted the next Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg makes splashing major cash palatable. If you’d spent $22 on one Apple share in 1980 when the company went public, your holding would now be worth almost $18,000.And so we’ve ended up with these frequently absurd overvaluations. Uber, Lyft and the owner of Snapchat have all in the last year received investment that gives them multibillion-dollar price tags, despite all making a solid loss. Tesla, more than $13bn in debt at the end of last year, recently had a market capitalisation of $160bn, greater than General Motors and Ford combined.The money sloshing into those entrepreneurial coffers is being propelled by a desperation to survive in a low-interest world, often foundationless optimism and – quite likely – an exaggerated belief in one’s ability to spot tomorrow’s wunderkind. But red flags are starting to appear and we should take them seriously.WeWork, famous for operating buzzy beer-on-tap co-working spaces, was forced to abort a huge stock market listing last year, despite having attracted billions from Tokyo-based conglomerate investment company SoftBank. SoftBank owns considerable stakes in businesses like Uber, Alibaba and Slack and its billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son, is regularly hailed as Japan’s answer to Warren Buffett.The misfire led commentators to refer to WeWork’s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, as a sort of Icarus – a visionary who flew too close to the sun and came crashing down. The company’s valuation was slashed from a preposterous $47bn to a still eyewatering but comparatively puny $8bn Neumann was ousted as CEO and was forced to give up majority voting control of the business.Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson declared in a note to clients last September that the “days of endless capital for unprofitable businesses” are over. WeWork’s failure to float, he said, was reminiscent of three historical events: United Airlines’ disastrous leveraged buyout in October 1989, which effectively ended the 1980s boom of companies being bought with debt the AOL-Time Warner tie-up in 2000, which marked the start of the dot-com bust and JP Morgan Chase’s 2008 purchase of defunct investment bank Bear Stearns. “It was one heck of a run,” wrote Wilson. “But paying extraordinary valuations for anything is a bad idea, particularly for businesses that may never generate a positive stream of cash flows.”And while markets still look fairly buoyant, it’s clear change is on the horizon. There are more WeWorks out there – houses of cards run by delusional wise guys – and we should endeavour to spot them before they catch us off-guard.Why? Because the collapse of a large company can send shockwaves through the entire economy and we don’t have much in the way of defences at the moment. Remember General Motors? By some accounts the US government bailout after the company’s 2009 bankruptcy cost taxpayers more than $10bn. And then there’s the fact that interest rates can’t stay pinned to the floor for ever. Central banks need to raise them in order to be able to cut them again when necessary. The process of doing so, however, is unlikely to be pretty. Record low rates have created distortions. Many companies have taken on a huge amount of debt because it’s been dirt cheap to do so. When rates rise it will become harder to service that debt. As Buffett famously said: “You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out.”For now this might sound abstract and irrelevant. But financial systems are a complex web of intertwined risks and dependencies. Our savings, our pensions, our mortgages and our loans are all at the mercy of what’s happening elsewhere, including in companies that seem invincible until the moment they aren’t. So beware of the unicorn, especially if it’s actually a dishevelled nag with a cone stuck to its head. It might seem thrilling for now, but it could well be an omen of unpleasant things to come.• Josie Cox is a columnist, reporter, commentator and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c1cfeb6b25e47732fd4dd7dc5dc730a8a8985f/152_1080_2531_1518/master/2531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93fa82508dc6fc4117eb28fd8e634c3e","title":"tories austerity budget","story":"Now is the time to invest – not just in northern infrastructure but in public services and the fight against climate crisis. It won’t happenThe budget will at last define a government that has stayed tantalisingly opaque. Who are they really? What do they really mean to do? This budget arrives amid a battalion of crises: coronavirus, severe flood damage from climate crisis and our homemade Brexit fallout, with billions wiped off stock markets. A crafty chancellor, watching his revenues falling, should see this moment as a God-given opportunity. Never let a good crisis go to waste, as they say. If they are genuinely determined to “level up” the nation’s inequalities then they should seize the day to borrow, tax and spend like there’s no tomorrow – because otherwise there might not be much of one.Imagine the Conservatives really meant it. Look what they could do on a honeymoon bounce, with an 80-seat majority won on a splurging promise to end austerity. The opposition is in leaderless disarray, Brexit is done (for now), and the Tory press still crows in adulation: see those “Baby joy for Boris” and cuddly Dilyn the dog stories.The darkening clouds give the government authority for action – there’s no better time for boldness. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) charts how every government at the height of its powers raises taxes in its first post-election budget. Next week’s needs to make the most of that tradition, or austerity will be baked into this government almost as severely as the last.Look up, and the sky is thick with bright red kites being flown above the Treasury, testing the weather for a host of astonishingly un-Tory ways to raise tax. Target property, says one kite, pointing to vast billions of unearned, untaxed wealth in the swollen assets of older generations sitting pretty in homes bought decades ago. A mansion tax was mooted, despite the opprobrium heaped on Ed Miliband’s plan when he was Labour leader. One kite suggested replacing business rates with a land value tax: target the raw value of the land, not the house, to capture the appreciation whenever the state builds a new station or a good school nearby. Easier still, if less radical, a revaluation of council tax bands – unchanged since 1991 – so the most expensive properties pay fairly.Here’s an easy test. So-called entrepreneurs’ relief is a capital-gains fiddle gifting just 5,000 rich company owners £350,000 each and costing the Treasury £3bn. It doesn’t encourage new entrepreneurs. Every serious analyst mocks this scam. Yet, even here, the auguries are not good: 150 prominent business leaders have written to the chancellor warning him not to touch it, threatening that start-ups will go to Singapore instead. The Sunday Times objects, warning the chancellor in a leader that business “still has to be convinced that this government is on its side”. Or what? They’ll vote Labour?Javid may in fact have made tax rises harder. Despite all those red kites he flew, he now tells his fellow back-benchers that he planned a 2p income tax cut. A Treasury riposte, however, says he never mentioned it.The upshot of all this is depressing. Expect a minimalist budget, not much of anything, say Treasury briefers. In the autumn, things may be clearer, they say – with no reason why. But one very interesting kite is still, just, fluttering. The golden rule professed (though not kept) by chancellors aims to get current spending into balance with revenues, allowing borrowing only for capital investment, such as roads or rail.This is, of course, a sham: there is no clean ide between everyday spending and investment. Borrowing to build an office block yields much less return than investing in human capital. Train someone up to degree or higher apprenticeship level, and that multiplies their productivity. What’s more, long after the office block is demolished, that trained and educated person produces future generations of educated producers.The government suggests it may change the rules to borrow for human capital investment. Despite the orthodoxy, there is no fixed limit to what the state can borrow. Ex-chancellor George Osborne swore Britain would go bust if it lost its triple-A credit rating. He lost it, but nothing happened. His “Labour maxed out the credit card” line was highly persuasive to families well used to that fear, but a nonsense for governments borrowing over the long term at rock-bottom interest rates.Only strong government investment can fend off today’s gathering storms and spur the austerity-stricken economy. Levelling up needs not just northern infrastructure but massive human capital investment, as the UK has one of the least educated populations among similar countries. Boris Johnson, in Churchill mode, could call for a patriotic budget to build climate defences, repair national flood damage, and prepare for the economic shocks of Brexit and coronavirus.Rousing the national spirit, he could call on the broadest shoulders to carry the heaviest tax burden in the national interest, tapping the wealth of those barely touched by the great crash of 2008 while the rest lost out for a decade. That’s something most easily done by a Tory government. But why would it? For all the “austerity is over” promises, don’t hold your breath. Expect token hi-vis building projects, but little to fill the black hole created by the great austerity. This government is not Keynesian: the nature of the beast will still be thoroughly Tory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a803faa685951bbe66d5f618bbfd0a8f685874e0/0_276_8318_4994/master/8318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf871ddbe34134c9fc786183e6447456","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of paradise","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘paradise’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘paradise’.Share your photos of what paradise means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 March at 10am.

The men had been squatting on remote forest land in the state of Mato Grosso when their bodies were found, according to court documents. Some showed signs of torture some had been stabbed, others shot.According to charges filed by state prosecutors in Mato Grosso, the massacre was carried out by a gang known as “the hooded ones”. The aim, they said, was to terrify locals, take over land they lived on and extract valuable natural resources. The first reporter to reach the lawless, far-flung region only got there a week later.On 15 May 2017, prosecutors said they had charged Valdelir João de Souza, a farmer who owned two timber companies on neighbouring land, and four others with homicide and forming or being part of an illegal paramilitary group. Prosecutors said de Souza had ordered the massacre, although he had not been present when it occurred. Since then de Souza has been a fugitive. But in April 2018 two adjacent areas of land – Três Lagoas and Piracama farms - in nearby Rondônia state were registered under his name (one of the oddities of the Brazilian property system is that landowners register their own land and boundaries). The two farms covered 1,052 hectares (2,599 acres) in an area set aside by the government for low-income agricultural workers. Satellite images show extensive deforestation on the Três Lagoas farm in 2015. Government sanitary records seen by Repórter Brasil show that on 9 May 2018 143 cattle were sold by the Três Lagoas and Piracama farms to a farm owned by Maurício Narde.Minutes later Narde’s farm sold 143 animals of the same sex and age – 80 female cattle between 13– 24 months old and 63 female cattle over 36 months old – to a JBS meatpacker.In June 2017, according to court documents in a separate case, Narde worked at a sawmill owned by de Souza in Machadinho d’Oeste in Rondônia state. He still works at the same sawmill, although it has since changed its name and is no longer controlled by de Souza. Reached by telephone by the , Narde confirmed the transaction but did not explain why he had sold the cattle after buying them minutes beforehand.“We buy and sell, just to keep things moving,” he said, before deciding not to answer any more questions and concluding the interview.The quick sale of the cattle suggests what environmentalists call “cattle laundering” – when cattle from a farm that has environmental issues sells cattle to a “clean” farm. This gets around monitoring systems because meat companies including JBS do not monitor these “indirect suppliers”.“This series of coincidences suggests a common practice, which is the triangulation of animals,” said Mauro Armelin, director of Friends of the Earth Brazil. “It is a practice that could indicate cattle laundering.”On 25 June 2018, according to government sanitary records, Três Lagoas also sold 153 head of cattle to the Morro Alto farm in Monte Negro, Rondônia, owned by José Carlos de Albuquerque.In the following months de Albuquerque sold dozens of head of cattle to JBS and Marfrig slaughterhouses.De Albuquerque told Réporter Brasil that the sale had never been completed – but the report cited sanitary records showing the cattle had, in fact, entered the Morro Alto farm. Contacted by the  by phone and email, he declined to answer questions.The Repórter Brasil investigation highlights the difficulties that Brazil’s big meat companies have in monitoring their supply chains.JBS and other big companies such as Marfrig committed to not buying from farms involved in illegal deforestation in two separate agreements signed with Greenpeace and Brazilian prosecutors in 2009 and subsequent years. Under the Greenpeace deal, the companies also promised to remove producers accused of land grabbing or convicted in rural conflicts from their suppliers lists. The deal with federal prosecutors similarly bans farms that have been convicted of involvement in rural conflicts, or that are being investigated.In the years following the cattle agreement, JBS made enormous progress in improving its monitoring of Amazon suppliers and the company defended its sustainability in a statement.“We monitor over 280,000 square miles, an area larger than Germany, and assess more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day, as well as conducting daily checks of all purchases to ensure compliance with strict standards. To date we have blocked more than 8,000 cattle-supplying farms due to noncompliance,” it said.But while the company now has a complex system in place to monitor its direct suppliers, it is still unable to monitor its indirect suppliers – those farmers who sell to farms that then sell on to JBS.De Souza’s case has yet to be concluded. Ulisses Rabaneda, a lawyer representing de Souza, told the  that he had decided not to reply to questions from the media at this stage in the court proceedings. In an interview with the Gazeta Digital in 2019, de Souza said he was innocent of all charges, had never been involved in death squads, and remained a fugitive because he was scared he would be murdered by the real killers if he handed himself in.“I never went around armed, so why at my age of 41, with solid companies, a peaceful life, no debts, without any problems, would I do something so barbaric?” de Souza said in the interview. “I built everything with the honesty and effort of my family. Why would I throw it all away?”JBS told Réporter Brasil that de Souza was not a supplier and that it does not “acquire cattle from farms involved in deforestation of native forests, invasion of indigenous reserves of conservation, rural violence, land conflicts, or that used slave or child labour”.“JBS reiterates that any attempt to link the company to the person mentioned in the report, who was never on its list of suppliers, is irresponsible,” the company told the .“Marfrig is fully aware of the challenges related to the livestock production chain and recognises its role as an important transformation agent to ensure production vis-à-vis the conservation of Brazilian biomes, especially the Amazon,” the company said. It detailed measures including a supplier monitoring platform and its Request for Information (RFI) tool, in which suppliers voluntarily list the farms they may have acquired animals from. The company says a third of the cattle it sources in the Amazon come with an RFI, and it is now working to improve the process with World Wildlife Fund.In 2017, a Greenpeace report published after the Colniza massacre said a company owned by de Souza, called Madeireira Cedroarana, had accumulated around $150,000 (£116,000) in unpaid fines over a decade from Brazil’s environment agency, Ibama.Between January 2016 and October 2017 the company exported thousands of cubic metres of timber to the US and Europe. In 2018 it changed its name to Colmar Madeiras it continues at the same address, but de Souza is no longer its controlling partner. In the interview with Gazeta Digital, he said his company had challenged fines it had received."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5edf9b189836340207ddbb9884cf9d8cf32cc490/0_66_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63c5b5be683d6c38faab3cfdb7bd115e","title":"chanels 80s homage madonnas crucifixes adam ants boots","story":"Virginie Viard continues her subtler approach following Lagerfeld’s death, as Kanye West steals Paris fashion week, with the help of his six-year-old“For the runway show, no frame. I don’t like framing,” said Chanel’s artistic director, Virginie Viard, before the brand’s autumnwinter 2020 fashion show in Paris.. Its quite a statement of intent given the megabrand’s decades-long ownership of the concept of fashion show as theatrical blockbuster.So on Tuesday, there was no rocket taking off in the middle of the catwalk (2017) no supermarket complete with boxes of Chanel-branded ketchup bottles (2014). Instead, models walked against a glossy white set, with layers of curvy seating trimmed with black, recalling a map’s contour lines.Viard, Karl Lagerfeld’s long-term right-hand woman, has taken a softer, subtler approach since taking over after the legendary designer’s death just over a year ago. This collection continued in that vein, throwing the focus on to more than 70 mainly monochrome looks, with occasional hints of coral pink. Current trends were addressed puffy sleeves, Wolf Hall necklines and thigh high splits in midi skirts were all present.Models came two or three abreast at times. Gigi Hadid walked, arm in arm, between two other models, a move which felt protective given her altercation last season with a catwalk gatecrasher.Trousers came with poppers at the side, fanning open to display footwear described, in press notes, as “seven-league boots” – which according to Charles Perrault’s fairytales allow wearers to traverse seven leagues per step – inspired by a pair once worn by Lagerfeld.There was a New Romantic mood in those piratey, Adam Ant-ish boots and the many ruffle-fronted shirts Madonna and Boy George were evoked in the liberal use of crucifixes. Two large crucifixes were knitted into jumpers, recalling the Lacroix crucifix jacket famously chosen by Anna Wintour – controversially, at the time, paired with jeans – for her first Vogue cover in 1988. That 1980s-influenced crucifix was the main trend takeaway, and looked ripe for reinvention.Kanye West staged a more bombastic, Lagerfeld-esque spectacle the previous evening. In a contrarian move, as some other brands scaled back fashion week plans owing to coronavirus fears, the musician’s Yeezy label made a surprise last-minute entry on to the schedule.No designer since Giorgio Armani has loved beige as much as West, who brought sand and ochre to the catwalk, in a pumped-up version of the dusty, post-apocalyptic athleisure that has become his signature. Stand out pieces included funnel-necked irregularly undulating puffer jackets, although West’s six-year-old daughter, North West, stole the show when she took to the catwalk and rapped, and duly melted the internet.Stealing Paris fashion week must have been satisfying for West, whose last Paris show was his 2011 debut. Critics were underwhelmed then, and less forgiving than they might have been, given his prior declaration that the show would “change the course of fashion”. Since then, however, that prophecy has come true, particularly the trainer market. West’s much-copied Yeezy line racked up sales of more than $1.5bn (£1.2bn) in 2019, the bulk of which from the ubiquitous, squishy wedge-shaped Yeezy Boost 350s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ea998bc67d9d5057e4d17615e5db741308c76e/0_0_600_360/master/600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e9133531e920af7eacd907cba8e627","title":"kim novak having fat injections in my cheeks was the worst thing i could have done","story":"The star of Vertigo on her favourite outfits, taking artistic inspiration from Hitchcock – and dealing with abuse from TrumpI think this look was ahead of its time.

My son latched on to the Sonic trailer – the updated one, not the disastrous one – the instant he saw it, and we watched it over and over (and over) for months. He made me act it out. He asked for Sonic-themed birthday presents. He loved the trailer so much that, when we went to see the film, he was palpably disappointed that it didn’t contain the cover version of Blitzkrieg Bop used in the trailer. It was obvious from seeing the trailer that Sonic would be a hit.This got me thinking. Can I use my five-year-old (and, where possible, my two-year-old) to predict the success of a film based on its trailer? This morning during breakfast, I made them sit and watch a batch, in the hope that one of them would be the next Sonic the Hedgehog. Here are my findings.Pixar’s film about two elf brothers who semi-successfully revive their dead father doesn’t have the immediacy of Sonic the Hedgehog, but nevertheless my kids watched the trailer transfixed. Did they want to see the film? “It looks funny, because the man turns too tiny in it,” the five-year-old said, referring to the final joke in the trailer. What else did you like? “Can we watch the Sonic trailer now?” Signs for Onward’s commercial success are not good.I was forced to watch the James Corden Peter Rabbit film on a sick day a few weeks ago, and it was actually much better than I would have guessed based on its horrible trailer. So I had high hopes for the sequel, which is out this month. Five seconds into the trailer, my two-year-old shouts: “FUNNY!” And then: “THIS IS A TRAILER!” And then, when Peter Rabbit Rabbit eats a rotten apple, he shouts: “THERE’S AN APPLE IN THE TRAILER!” Then: “TOMATOES!” The trailer got two big, sustained laughs out of my kids. When it finished, the five-year-old declared it to be, “The funniest thing I ever heard,” and the two-year-old pointed at the screen and intoned the word: “Cheeky.” Based on this, I suspect Peter Rabbit 2 will be a Paddington 2-style crossover hit.In which hard-boiled intelligence agent Dave Bautista mimics Kindergarten Cop by looking after a child for some reason. The trailer was met with open hostility. “It’s a bit too scary and bit too boring,” the five-year-old says 10 seconds in. One minute later, he asks of Bautista: “Why does he keep killing everything, but not his family?” That’s a good question, I reply. Why do you think? “Because he likes his family, but he’s a baddie.” The two-year-old attempts to lift the mood by telling me that I look like Bautista, but it’s too little, too late. The trailer is abandoned before it ends, and this leaves no doubt that My Spy will be a gigantic flop.Now to the biggest surprise of the test: Disney’s forthcoming live-action Mulan remake. We’re treated to a stately panorama shot of ancient China, and the five-year-old confirms my worst suspicions by sighing and saying: “This looks too much like a grownup film.” But then an army starts running up the side of a wall and the kids are in. “Woah,” the five-year-old shouts, setting up what will almost definitely end up being a poster quote: “This is boring but cool!” Then he asks: “Is this in China?” and perks up enormously. “This has great music!” he shouts. After it ends, he says: “Awesome, very cool.” Mulan will be an inevitable hit.After the surprise success of Mulan’s trailer, the one for the Michael Caine and Russell Brand adaptation of Jacqueline Wilson’s novel Four Children and It didn’t stand a chance. I chose the minute-long trailer, but not even it could hold their attention. “I want breakfast,” the two-year-old yelled. I tried appealing to the five-year-old. Is it good? Would you watch it? “The monster gave the kids powers,” he replied. Do you want a monster to give you powers? “No. Can I watch Sonic now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50a4fa8db02ce6abfaa815808d17934b36e3757/0_51_1023_614/master/1023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=933652edf5350b3abbdc7168cfbb9f7a","title":"hollywood alley with the five star reviews chaplin keaton","story":"Historian campaigns to have Los Angeles location renamed Chaplin Keaton Lloyd Alley after the silent movie stars who filmed thereThere’s a short alley in Hollywood, running east-west between Cahuenga Boulevard and Cosmo Street, which currently has more than 100 five-star reviews on Google. One user describes visiting the street as “akin to a Catholic entering the Vatican”. Another calls it “the Holy Grail of Hollywood sites” and others have hailed it as “iconic”, “legendary”, “of monumental significance” and “sacred ground”.There is a reason for these glowing reviews of a tiny strip of Hollywood real estate. This passage is featured prominently in three silent classics: Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid (1921), Buster Keaton’s Cops (1922) and Harold Lloyd’s Safety Last! (1923). Film historian John Bengtson is leading a campaign to have the street named Chaplin Keaton Lloyd Alley and the recent surge of Google reviews is the latest move in his crusade.Bengtson has been identifying the Los Angeles locations used in silent movies since 1995. He offers tours and lectures, and has published the details of scores of film locations on his website Silent Locations. He usually works by consulting aerial photographs of Hollywood from the 1920s and comparing them against film scenes. In this case, a festival screening of another silent film, The Last Edition (1925), tied a few unsolved cases together.“That movie filmed many scenes at the alley, from many different angles,” says Bengtson. “I nearly fell out of my seat. Finally, the pieces all fit, it all made sense.”The alley had also been used by directors Lois Weber and Cleo Madison, and star Harry Houdini, before Chaplin spotted it. “It was close to the studios. It faced south, so it was lit by the sun most of the day,” says Bengtson. “So it makes perfect sense film-makers knew this was the place to go.”Chaplin chose this alley, about a mile from his Hollywood studio (now owned by the Jim Henson Company) to shoot the scene in which he discovers an abandoned baby in the opening scenes of The Kid. In Cops, Keaton stages a phenomenal stunt there – grabbing one-handed on to a speeding car that drags him, feet flying, out of the frame. The alleyway can also be seen multiple times in Lloyd’s thrill-comedy Safety Last!, best known for the sequence in which the star climbs a department store building and finds himself hanging from a clock face.Over the years there have been many reasons cited for changing street names in LA. In the 1880s, the residents of Charity Street objected to living “on charity” their home is now called Grand Avenue. Last May, Rodeo Road was renamed Barack Obama Boulevard, joining a selection of other local streets named after former presidents. Despite a significant amount of opposition, in 1996, a section of the street near the Church of Scientology was officially named L Ron Hubbard Way.There are several LA streets named after film stars, too. You’ll find Astaire Avenue and Garland Drive in a new suburb built on land that was once the MGM studio lot, for example, but renaming existing roads can be trickier. After comic star Edward Everett Horton’s death in 1970 the city renamed a street in the shadow of Ventura Freeway as Edward Everett Horton Lane. The section covered land that Horton had sold to the city when the freeway was built.Notoriously, singer Rudy Vallée petitioned to have the section of Pyramid Place near his home in Hollywood Hills named Rue de Vallée. The city rejected his proposal after locals objected. Dismissing his neighbours as “disgruntled pukes”, Vallée erected a similar sign on his driveway instead.Giving a strong precedent for Chaplin Keaton Lloyd Alley, Silverlake is now officially home to The Music Box Steps – scene of Laurel and Hardy’s unforgettable piano-shifting calamities in the 1932 movie.In 2018, a historical marker was placed outside the site of the studio on Lillian Way that was used by Keaton in the 1920s and Chaplin from 1916-17, though the studio itself was demolished in 1931. Six blocks north of there, the section of Cahuenga Boulevard just south of Hollywood Boulevard, where you’ll find the alley, occupies a special place in Bengtson’s research. According to his studies, Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd shot more films on this stretch of road than anywhere else in Hollywood.“If someday this alley is named in their honour, if someday silent-film fans visit here from around the world because people know about this alley, it would be beyond humbling and gratifying,” says Bengtson. “History is everywhere, if we only know where to look. Somehow this alley was meant to be remembered, it deserves to be remembered, and that’s why I’m lobbying on its behalf.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0bb5d9b0337529ec5faae22ff59148086e15915/0_915_4916_2948/master/4916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be2fb4db871e2ec5180a4d2ff2a7c807","title":"nigel slater midweek meals butter beans cabbage mi cuit tomatoes","story":"Tins and jars are put to good use for this comforting supper of creamy beans, sweet-savoury tomatoes, and bright, fresh cabbagePeel and roughly chop 3 medium-sized onions.

Email feast@theI’ve stopped eating tomatoes for health reasons, but I like cooking Italian food. Are there any alternatives to tomatoes in dishes such as lasagne and caponata?Charles, North YorkshireTomatoes were a relatively late addition to Italian cuisine, with pasta sauces and braises coloured red in only the late 16th and 17th century. As the ’s food writer in Rome Rachel Roddy – whose use of the fruit has decreased since moving to Italy – puts it, we need to move away from tomato domination. “So many Italian dishes, such as hunter’s chicken, braised rabbit or oxtail stew, have a pre-tomato version,” she says, “and eight times out of 10, I prefer them.”Seek out the original versions, then focus on your use of olive oil, garlic, chilli and, if you’re making pasta sauce, the starchy pasta cooking water. Roddy has a few tricks, though, for achieving that umami flavour when tomatoes aren’t in play: “Anchovies, parmesan, porcini and herbs, such as rosemary and sage, can give that meatiness you might otherwise miss.”Lasagne is also within your grasp, Charles. Trivelli’s favourite (tomato or otherwise) is an artichoke version: remove the tough outer leaves, pare away the green flesh from the base of the artichoke and stem, scrape out the hairy choke, then slice, cook and use to layer up between sheets of lasagne, bechamel and cheese.Slow-cooked red peppers, if you can eat them, give a good base for sauces, stews and spooning over mozzarella or burrata, says Tim Siadatan, chef and co-owner of Padella, a second site of which has just opened in Shoreditch. “Put them on a charcoal grill or barbecue to get a lovely, smoky flavour,” he says, but a gas stove will also work. Cook the peppers until the outsides are nice and blistered, then transfer to a bowl and cover to steam. Once they are cool enough to handle, Siadatan peels off the skin, removes the seeds and finely slices. Then, in a separate pan, he adds “a load of sliced garlic and some dried chilli, and sweats down in olive oil over a low heat until they’re sweet and sticky.” Season with salt and pepper, add a splash of cabernet sauvignon vinegar, some fresh marjoram (if you can’t find any, use basil) and a dollop of mascarpone or creme fraiche, and you’ll have a creamy sauce to wrap around penne.Alternatively, Siadatan says, “add cooked runner beans cut into inch-long pieces with some mascarpone and basil, and you’ve got a garnish for lamb or throw in some chickpeas, lentils or other pulses for a stewy vibe.” Life without tomatoes can still be rosy.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Klopp, expected to make several changes for his first FA Cup fifth-round tie, believes no Liverpool player performed at their usual level at Watford. But he insists faith in a team who remain on course to win the Premier League title in record time is unbroken. “I am not a little bit in doubt about the character of the boys and I would be a real idiot if I would be because they deserve my trust, my faith, and they don’t lose it after a bad game,” he said.Klopp analysed the Watford game when he returned home on Saturday night before hosting a regular team meeting at Melwood on Sunday. “It can happen that I get angry but I didn’t get angry with the players in this meeting,” he said. “If I go in that meeting and shout at them like they have lost the last 10 games because of a bad attitude that would be really strange. I am not interested that after the meeting I feel better. I am interested in the boys getting the right information.“The situation we are in is special. Who can give us advice? Could I say that is the way we have to deal with it because I was there 20 times before and we dealt with it like this and it always worked out? No. I was never in a situation like that. We came through an incredible long period with incredible performances, sensational football, wonderful goals and great success until this point.“There is a reason for losing a game and I prefer seeing the reason than not knowing why. It was not that the fortunes changed or that destiny wanted to give us a knock. We were just not good enough. That is the easy answer and that is filled with a lot of information that the boys get but not too much because we don’t want to think about that game for too long.”Klopp has James Milner back from injury for the FA Cup tie but Jordan Henderson and Naby Keïta remain sidelined by hamstring and hip problems respectively. He said there can be no repeat of the Watford performance against Chelsea.“This is an exceptional group of players,” he said. “They did outstanding stuff – but not that night. For the next game we need to improve immediately or else we will get punished.

Should I think that just because we want to respond that we shoot Chelsea out of their own stadium? No. It will be a tough game.”Curtis Jones, Pedro Chirivella and Neco Williams have played every minute of Liverpool’s FA Cup campaign this season and though Klopp is likely to deploy a mix of youth and experience at Stamford Bridge, he insists his desire to win the competition cannot be questioned.“We cannot fight more for the cup competitions than we do already,” he said. “One cup competition that we proved we take really seriously in the last couple of years is the Champions League. The FA Cup? It’s nothing to do with us not wanting to go to the final. It was just because of draws or performances. Team selections were always reasonable, there was always a good reason for it. We will play Chelsea with all we have. Then Bournemouth with all we have. Then Madrid with all we have. Then Everton, then Crystal Palace or FA Cup, right? It will be with all we have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ce84065b161c14eaf7ab1f39d33570932854c9/505_518_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d43666f7a6109130f161c14c954ed3f","title":"dawn scott england women sports scientist usa world cups","story":"South Shields-born sports scientist who helped the USA win two World Cups explains her philosophy and why she rejoined EnglandThe three-times World Cup-winning centre-back Christie Pearce Rampone described Dawn Scott as “the secret to everything” and the Ballon d’Or winner Megan Rapinoe, asked how she felt about losing the US women’s national team’s high-performance coach to England, shed tears.For those who have worked with Scott, she is simply the best. Now, after nine years with the US, the South Shields-born sports scientist is working for the Lionesses, aiming to unseat her former team from the top of the game. Scott won two World Cups and one Olympics with the US but switched sides at the end of last year and faces her former employers in her first game with England: in the SheBelieves Cup on Thursday.The game has come too soon for the England players to have fully benefited from having Scott on board, and being in the ‘other’ dugout at the Exploria Stadium in Orlando will test her emotions. “Yes, it will feel weird,” Scott says, sitting on a sofa in St George’s Park, ginger tea in hand. “It was my life. I built some very close professional relationships with players. When Lindsey Horan came back from PSG, we took her to LA for two or three days to do some testing and we literally chaperoned her round with me saying: ‘Have you had tea? Are you going to bed?’ She now calls me mum,” she says with a smile.Then there was unfinished business. Scott previously spent nine years with the FA as head of sports science. “Take Jill Scott and Steph Houghton, for example,” she says. “I was around when they were coming into the England squad and the other piece for me is to be a part of their journey again.”Thinking she would be a physics teacher, Scott studied the subject in Nottingham, but university football dominated and she took a year out, getting a job as a data scientist before transferring to study accountancy, and play football, at Sheffield Hallam. In the end she found her fit: sports science at Manchester Met. A string of jobs in the field followed and in 2001 they led to a job with Hope Powell’s England women’s team.“Back in the day at the FA we used to have a regional strength and conditioning programme,” Scott recalls. “In four of the regions the best place for players to go for strength and conditioning was the local prisons because they had the best equipment. So there was a group up in the north-east: Jill, Steph, Demi Stokes, Jordan Nobbs and, a little bit later, Lucy Bronze, Carly Telford, and they would go into the prison twice a week and lift. The trainer would meet them at the reception and lead them through the prison. Jill being Jill, full of energy, nothing malicious, would mess around so she actually got banned from going for a while.”Things were not too dissimilar when she left to join the US in 2011 but what followed was a decade of innovation at the top level. One well-publicised area was the use of the FitrWoman period tracker app to monitor players’ menstrual cycles. “For me there’s not enough evidence right now to be able to prescribe training on the back of menstrual cycles,” Scott says cautiously. “There also isn’t enough evidence, or enough injuries, to fully relate and link injuries – and one step further ACL injuries – specifically to menstrual cycle that’s my personal opinion. Yes, we did menstrual cycle education and support in the lead-up to the World Cup with the US team. For me the first step is the education and awareness.“I’m a big fan of education. If you’re going to ask a player to do something, do they understand the mechanism and the why? We travelled to the nine US pro teams and delivered an education session and then with the US team we had them fill in a long survey to identify any symptoms they may be feeling or any impact they felt it had on their performance and then we addressed the symptoms. Imagine you’ve got a player saying they’re sore, they’re not sleeping, they’re not recovering? Obviously that’s going to impact a player’s performance whether it’s menstrual cycle related or not. So we started addressing those things, through focusing on the recovery.”Scott helped build a winning machine and is increasingly aware that, like the players, she is powerful role model. A female scientist at the top of her trade, Scott has taken part in the CBS television series Mission Unstoppable which aims to close the gender gap in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths). “I think we’ve almost got a duty to be visible,” she says. “I guess there were no role models out there for me,.”For the 11.7 million BBC viewers of England’s semi-final defeat by the US in last summer’s World Cup the superiority of the Americans was clear. “I’m a fan of looking at every single facet of a player’s performance,” Scott says. “Whether that’s recovery, nutrition, hydration the stuff on the field is one or two or three hours of the day. The FA has a project called ‘The other 22 hours’. For me you could be the best trainer on the field but if you don’t then look after yourself as much as you excel on the field then you’re not starting the next session as recovered as you could be.“We talk about being 247 athletes and that’s what you have to be. When you finish training what are you putting into your body? Hydration, nutrition, what’s your recovery? Are you delaying recovery? Are you on your feet all day on your day off? Or are you resting and recovering your body for the next session? What are you doing from a mental perspective? I feel like a lot of the time we focus on the physical recovery and preparation but there’s the mental side as well. Do we rest our brains? Do we rest our mind? How do we recover the brain and mind? Sleep is the freest form of recovery and how many of them or us have effective and good sleep at different kick-off times? On different days of the week?”It is that attention to detail that saw such an emotional outpouring from members of the USWNT, and fans, on the announcement of Scott’s departure. “I think sometimes we get caught up with numbers and data and we lose track of the player,” says Scott. “First and foremost we have to always remember the player is a person. I think the person, the player, has to be central to everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bb8f99f92041912f86f8caeb0f360403d3a9a16/0_0_4086_2452/master/4086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d42c25ecbd314365c476ff53735e29","title":"premier league debates behind closed doors coronavirus contingency plan","story":"The Premier League is discussing contingency plans regarding playing matches behind closed doors should the threat of coronavirus lead to mass gatherings being banned.Although the league will continue to be led by government policy on health and will not take any immediate decisions, talks are continuing to ensure the season can be completed.Coronavirus is yet to become widespread in the United Kingdom but matches in Italy’s Serie A have been disrupted by the disease, with six being postponed at the weekend.The Football Association has to consider England’s friendly with Italy, which is due to be played on 27 March at Wembley.

Let’s try to be optimistic, not think about dark scenarios – there’s time for that later.”Uefa’s plans for the European Championship and fixtures in the Champions League and Europa League remain unchanged, but its general secretary Theodore Theodoridis revealed that a consultation group had been formed with European leagues to monitor the situation.“We are addressing the situation, maintaining contact with the World Health Organisation and different governments,” he said. “We have to deal with it case by case we do not want to overreact. Yesterday we had a meeting with European Leagues to create a coordination group to find a possible solution.”Meanwhile the Scottish Football Association confirmed that Clarke would not be here for the draw. “On the back of the first response meeting, it was determined by the group that the national coach attending was an unnecessary risk,” a spokesperson said.Earlier Ceferin had given his annual address to Uefa members which contained a bullish assessment of the organisation’s strengths as it continues its struggle for control over football with the world governing body, Fifa.Ceferin admitted that Uefa must do more to combat racism in the game but went on to describe football as a “social movement” before saying his organisation must put “purpose before power” and use its rapidly growing revenues to better the game across the continent.These remarks were interpreted as a response to Infantino’s suggestion that Fifa’s Club World Cup tournament, seen by Uefa as a possible rival to the Champions League, was designed with the purpose of helping less prosperous football nations.In addressing racism in the game, Ceferin said: “Many of us have been sickened by what we have witnessed in a number of European stadiums this season. The problem is not on the pitch, where ersity is greater than in any other sport and probably any other part of society. The problem is in our societies. And this has to stop.“We must begin by applying the rules we already have. That would be a good starting point. That means applying the three-step procedure. We must not be afraid to do so. Everywhere. No exceptions. But … we need to do more. More, and perhaps differently.

Certain projects, some devised on other continents with the backing of governing bodies, are particularly worrying.“If our success enables us to ward off threats that appear on the horizon, we can be proud. These threats are alarming. And we need to anticipate the worst if we are to prevent it. When purpose over profit becomes profit over purpose, it is time to raise the alarm. Football is not simply a business like any other.”Ceferin also addressed Manchester City’s Champions League ban, defending the independence of Uefa’s investigation into breaches of financial fair play regulations. The nature of the investigation process, conducted by Uefa’s club financial control body, could form part of City’s appeal to the court of arbitration for sport but Ceferin said he was proud of the system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf324439279c2ccc2834ab837740b1c1315a590/1049_1131_930_558/master/930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c9af086e9c4a641124024ed67d79db5","title":"david squires on manchester city league cup final watford liverpool arsenal invincibles","story":"Our cartoonist looks back at the League Cup final and a Watford win that was celebrated heartily by Arsenal’s Invincibles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e584179c3634221ad810c80241f2a04e512ba26/0_375_5623_3374/master/5623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840d6d3ab165556585140fb482d1cc01","title":"i can see the mobile team saving sight in the kenyan bush in pictures","story":"Trachoma is the most common infectious cause of blindness in the world.

What’s in store for pan-European couples?In July 1974 I kissed a girl for the first time. She was called Martine and she lived next door to my French exchange partner, Pascal, in the half-timbered town of Chalon-sur-Saône in southern Burgundy.I was as in love as a teenager can be, albeit less (I later realised) with Martine than with being 14, English, and in France for the first time, doing things I’d never done before: staying up past 9pm smoking Gitanes sans filtre listening to Françoise Hardy.And it pretty much determined the course of my life. I shot to top of the class in French and studied languages at university. I flirted with a few other European countries first, but eventually – inevitably – came home to France.At the Vaudeville brasserie in Paris, now closer to 40 than 14, I met a funny, fearless and (fair’s fair) frequently infuriating French woman and fell in love, this time properly. We’ve been together for 22 years, in Paris, London and now Paris again, and have produced two fine (and also quite funny) children.Moving for love can take different forms. Sometimes it’s to get it together. Sometimes, as with us, it’s to stay together. But whatever the reason, it happens a lot: for this week of coverage underlining the ’s commitment to Europe, we asked you for stories of pan-European passion and got more than 300 replies.Love, famously, knows no boundaries. But we Brits, and our European partners, should admit it: we’ve been lucky. For nearly 50 years we have been able freely to work, live and love across a continent. For those coming after, things may not be so smooth. Love will find a way, of course it always has. But the path is already starting to become overgrown.Even for those of us already settled, residence permits must now be applied for and second passports acquired. Some people’s jobs are threatened. And if nobody yet knows what rules will apply to those moving for love after this year, the end of free movement means it’s most unlikely to be any easier.Some, thankfully, got it all over with a long time ago. Janice Hood, 65, a Scottish-born teacher and translator, moved to Bari in southern Italy in 1976 after meeting – and, a few months later, marrying – Dario in London, where he was studying English and working for the summer. Both were 21.“For five years, we lived with his parents,” she says. “I worked for his uncle’s shipping agency. When our daughter was two we bought our own place, and 24 years ago we moved to Rome. I’ve now happily spent two-thirds of my life in Italy. Dario and I are still together, still in love. In April we celebrate our 44th wedding anniversary.”There will be no more moving for Janice. “I could never go back to the UK,” she says. “I can barely recognise the country I left more than 40 years ago. I’ll always be Scottish, but now I’m Italian and European too.”Others fell for a country before they fell in love with a person. Thomas Lacroix, 46, hiked round Scotland for a year after finishing university in France, “captivated by the beauty of the landscape, the mentality of the people, the openness of their hearts … Then I met my true love, in a youth hostel in the Western Isles.”The couple have been married for over 20 years, and have two children. Thomas says his personality “suits British culture”, but fears that as Brexit advances, the UK will “wake up slowly to the reality of what’s happened”. And he’s fairly sure there might be difficulties travelling and visiting relatives.Some, sadly, are now coping without the love they moved for. Emmy Chater, 62, left the Netherlands for Wales in 1999, after meeting her husband Les, more than 30 years her senior, on holiday in France. She was, she says, somewhat “surprised by the social, cultural, governmental and economic differences – not to mention the Welsh valleys dialect, and the food … But I felt invincible and optimistic because I was in love.”It was not all plain sailing – Emmy’s Dutch qualifications were not recognised, and she had to retrain – but she says she feels “very fortunate to have been able to spend 17 wonderful years with my soulmate, lover and best friend. Sadly, he died in 2016 after a short illness, and I have gradually learned to live without him.”Now, Emmy feels as much Welsh as Dutch. “But I feel very ambivalent about Britain. I am saddened and concerned by the isions, the racist and hateful language and actions … It makes me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I sometimes wish I could move to a country that respects and welcomes migrants and treats all people with equality and respect.”Others moved very recently. After living for seven years in the UK with her Danish husband, Jeppe, Rosie Andersen, 32, currently on maternity leave with her eight-month-old son, left for Denmark at the end of January. She says she is already “feeling the pressure to apply for residency before the transition period ends”. The couple met while travelling in New Zealand, and eventually Jeppe moved to the UK, applying for – and getting – British citizenship after the Brexit vote.In Denmark, people “work to live, and it’s never a competition to show off what you have”, Rosie says. “It will be a great place to bring up our son.” But she was slightly shocked to be told, on her first encounter with a local government office: “‘Brexit day tomorrow better hurry up and apply to stay’”Katrice Horsley, 55, met her Swedish husband, Anders Holmgren, in a check-in queue at Heathrow airport. She has struggled a bit with “the reserved nature” of the Swedes, but adores “the nature, the outdoors, the celebrations to mark the changing seasons”. And she and Anders are still “very much in love”.But Brexit means she now has to apply for a residence permit, and get “a special stamp to show I was living here beforehand”. As a freelance performer and consultant working across Europe, she knows, too, that she will need to apply for an Irish or Swedish passport to continue providing cross-border services.Some have moved more than once. Patrick Dubeau Brown, 29, is training to be an English teacher in Nantes, France. As a teenager he spent five years in France with his parents, before financial setbacks forced them back to the UK. Patrick stayed to finish his exams, then followed them across the Channel.“I was in a new relationship at the time and I managed to stay with them for about six months, but the long-distance thing was getting complicated,” he says. “My parents really wanted me to stay, but I booked a plane to be with my girlfriend in Nantes … I love it. We’re now married, and looking to start a family.”Patrick, who has acquired French citizenship, says it feels “strange for me to go back to England and see the family. The UK is a foreign country for me now. Getting married was also the opportunity to really put down roots, and adopt a double barrelled name with my wife.”Some had to move – and events have since conspired, tragically, against them. Katharina Schramm, 44, a German gynaecologist, moved not particularly willingly to London 16 years ago with her Indian husband, so he could complete his studies at the LSE and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on an EU spouse visa.He has now been diagnosed with leukaemia. “I’m stuck in the UK with three children, in the aftermath of Brexit and the same German passport we needed in 2004 – except England has now voted for me to leave,” she says. “People don’t want to hear I had to move here. If it wasn’t for the leukaemia, I would be back in Germany.”And some moved and have no worries about it at all. Jeff Davy, 46, has taught English in Warsaw since he abandoned a civil service job in Kilkenny to join his girlfriend, Ania, whom he met on a plane while going to a stag do in Poland in May 2007.“I had an aisle seat,” he recalls. “One of my friends was a row behind me on the other side of the aisle. We’re drinking, chatting and having the craic. My friend starts talking to the passenger sitting directly behind me. A Polish girl. I loved her accent from the off. I turned around and was immediately taken.”The couple exchanged numbers at the airport, and met again when Ania returned to Dublin for work a month later. Jeff moved to Warsaw the following year. “It might resemble a Hollywood film or what have you, but we’ll have been married 11 years this May,” he says. “Two beautiful children. We’re all well and very, very happy together.”Life, Jeff says, “is just great”. He is grateful, though, for his Irish passport. “Brexit hasn’t affected me. But a few of my friends here are British … It’s not the same for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44375a65f889654ebd5419b4b067384873d9c9ee/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ccb5fd0ac12662535d8efad72db526","title":"fiona bruce surprised at question times level of toxicity","story":"Presenter speaks out after BBC politics show was embroiled in racism rowThe Question Time presenter, Fiona Bruce, has said she had not anticipated how angry the show’s audiences would be.Bruce, who replaced the veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby last year, described the “level of toxicity” she had witnessed on the show in the Radio Times.“I’m all for a passionate debate, and sometimes things can be heated, which is fine, up to a point. As long as we remember that we are human beings,” she said.“I feel very strongly about that. I hadn’t anticipated that I would spend so much of my time last year saying, ‘we don’t talk to each other like this.’”Last month the  journalist Owen Jones said “the BBC normalised racism” after an audience member said the number of people “flooding in” to the UK is costing public services too much.Their comments were uploaded to Twitter, a move Jones said “seemed to imply that this wasn’t racism – it was simply someone’s opinion, for us to agree or disagree with, in much the same way that we might debate the top rate of tax, or whether the railways should be renationalised”.This was not Question Time’s first audience-related controversy this year. In January the show became entangled in a racism row. The actor and guest panelist Laurence Fox said “we’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”, after the university lecturer and audience member Rachel Boyle claimed Meghan Markle had been the victim of racism.Fox accused Boyle, who is mixed race, of being racist towards him for stating he had privilege as a white man. He said: “It’s so easy to throw the charge of racism and it’s really getting boring now.”The regulator Ofcom received more than 250 complaints after Fox’s appearance. Boyle later told the Observer she received a barrage of hateful comments on social media after the show.Speaking about Fox’s controversial appearance, Bruce said: “I had a briefing about Laurence, and what he might say. But the thing about Question Time is that it’s entirely unpredictable, so people will get into arguments.”In addition to hosting the show, Bruce also presents the long-running and successful Antiques Roadshow. She said there were similarities with the shows. “Antiques Roadshow is a public service. It reflects the nation back to itself, as does Question Time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/756888c1c6e2d325f5ca3556dd4a0487f878889f/0_0_3564_2267/master/3564.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=45312392d0eaa5c2e33679f27c10fa34","title":"europe where find guardian readers map","story":"We created a map to show our growing European readership, and asked some of our readers on the continent to tell us why they support the ’s journalism.

Can the club scene survive? As its home venue is closed down, we hit legendary party Cocktail d’AmoreIt is 1am on a Saturday and the crowd outside Berlin LGBTQ+ club night Cocktail d’Amore stretches from the door of its venue, Griessmuehle, along the side of the Neukölln Ship Canal and out on to the road. It takes the best part of five minutes to walk from one end of the queue to the other, and these are just the early birds: Cocktail d’Amore opened its doors an hour ago, and will go on continuously for the next 56 hours, ending at 8am on Monday.You can see why Cocktail d’Amore is such a draw. From a distance, Griessmuehle looks more like a wonderland than you might expect a converted grain mill to look: a haze of multicoloured lights glowing on the canal. Inside, Cocktail d’Amore feels like a Platonic ideal of what a club night should be. The sound system is immaculate, the music fantastic. While I’m there, at least, it leans towards the kind of sinuous mid-tempo sound that Andy Weatherall jokingly described as “drug-chug” the late DJ was so enamoured of playing the room at Cocktail d’Amore dubbed the Cosmic Hole that he wrote a track inspired by the experience, Into the Cosmic Hole.The crowd is wildly erse – dressed-down kids in hoodies alongside guys in drag girls in standard-issue techno black dancing with men in their underpants. At one point, a gay couple in their 70s sweep past. They’re conservatively dressed for dinner at the Savoy in the 1920s – one of them is walking with a silver-topped cane. The atmosphere is simultaneously friendly, excited and licentious: a friend who goes there regularly calls it “benign freedom”. Bouncers on the door make everyone cover the camera lens on their phone with a sticker you don’t realise how accustomed you’ve become to people constantly filming their night out or taking selfies and what a difference it makes to the overall mood, until you find yourself somewhere where absolutely no one’s got their phone out.The venue, meanwhile, is appealingly rough around the edges – graffiti covers the walls and the DJ booth, there’s a burnt-out car in the garden outside – and its industrial past is obvious, which adds to the experience. As Liam Cagney, an academic and regular Cocktail patron who’s about to publish a book on Berlin’s clubs, puts it: “It gives you these sort of surreal moments. You lose your sense of the outside world in these industrial spaces, like the everyday fabric has been torn off.”But you can’t miss the handmade signs on the walls with their slogans: SAVE OUR SPACES, DON’T BREAK OUR HEARTS. They look like something from a protest march, which they probably are. A few days before I arrive in Berlin there’s a big gathering in Neukölln, protesting against Griessmuehle’s imminent closure: the venue is the victim of redevelopment. Its owner, an Austrian real estate company, declined to renew the club’s lease because it wants to turn the site into offices and flats. The protest didn’t do any good: Griessmuehle is closing, and this is the last party Cocktail d’Amore will throw there.It’s a situation that has been mirrored in capital cities throughout the world, not least in the UK (look online and you can find ghost maps of London’s lost nightlife, complete with photos of shiny office buildings and apartment blocks that used to house clubs). But it seems particularly strange to talk about Berlin’s nightclubs being in crisis: they’re one of the things the city has been famed for. Techno may have been born in Detroit, but no city fell harder for its charms than the German capital. Since the early 90s, it’s been techno’s second home, host to a succession of globally known clubs, from E-Werk and Tresor to Berghain. The city’s reputation has been bolstered by the city’s longstanding reputation for what Garavelloni and Turco call “freedom and permissiveness”: “From the laws in place – there’s no set closing time for clubs – to the ways that clubs decide to auto-regulate, which is way more relaxed and loose than anywhere else, and of course the incredible out-of-the-norm people who reside here.”According to Lutz Leichsenring of Berlin’s Club Commission – an organisation and lobby group set up in the early 00s to promote the city’s nightlife – the problems began “after the financial crisis, around 2010 to 2012. We had a couple of years to breathe, but then the money was back and now we see low interest rates and insecure markets that mean a lot of companies invest in real estate. They pay speculation prices – more than the actual value of a site right now. So if you’re a club in that building they kick you out right away, because they need to earn money, they need high rents.”Leichsenring estimates one-third of the city’s clubs have been lost in the last 10 years: Germans call the process Clubsterben, meaning “club death”. New clubs have opened in their place, but as he points out: “Sometimes a very iconic club closed down and a mainstream club opened that just wants to maximise its profits, play chart music, have bottle service, because they pay a higher rent. It’s a kind of quality reduction. We’re interested in places that have a social and cultural value.”At least 40 more clubs are currently under threat, a state of affairs compounded by the fact that Berlin is a growing city in the grip of a housing crisis. Ironically, says Leichsenring, Berlin’s club scene has something to do with that. “Startups are the thing in Berlin, I think we have more of them than any city in Europe after London,” he tells me. “They’re scaling up, employing many thousands of people, and it’s very, very easy to attract talent to the city. You see the job adverts for engineers and IT specialists and they basically say, ‘Come to work in Berlin, because it’s the greatest cultural clubbing city in the world.’ That’s the main issue, not that we pay the highest wages, not that you’ll get the most amazing job.”That’s a more compelling argument to put to politicians than Berlin’s reputation as a club tourist’s destination, he says. “Tourism is perceived as over-tourism, with noise and litter.” Nevertheless, politicians seem to be listening to what the Club Commission has to say. The city authority invested €1m in soundproofing clubs to avoid neighbour complaints about noise. The mayor of Neukölln spoke at the Griessmuehle protest, and there was a subsequent parliamentary resolution that the club needed to be supported. It’s not unusual for German political parties to have “something like a club spokesman”, while a recent Club Commission event attracted senators and members of the Bundestag. There are plans afoot to reclassify clubs, giving them “the same cultural status as a theatre or concert hall”. At the moment, they’re still classed as “amusement venues, which means in building law, they’re on the same level as brothels and casinos and porn cinemas”.But the real issue isn’t convincing the politicians: it’s convincing the property developers. “You can have strong support from the politicians, but if someone owns the real estate and they legally have the right to build offices, then you don’t have a lot of power,” says Leichsenring. “It’s trying to make developers realise that they should do not what gets the maximum profit, they should maybe do something that is paying into the city. If they have a long term plan for the city, they should definitely think about including people who made Berlin as attractive as it is.”That sounds like a remarkably tall order – property developers aren’t exactly renowned for zealously guarding cities’ cultural lives – but everyone I speak to in Berlin seems cautiously optimistic about the future. Leichsenring talks about introducing a code of conduct for developers, organising conferences “so that urban promoters and club owners can pitch ideas in front of great developers”. Cagney points out that Berlin clubs have a reputation for resilience and mutability. “A lot of the people who organise parties there are quite politically engaged, a lot of them are involved in the LGBTQ+ movement, there are nights like Room 4 Resistance, which is about music and gender identities, but it’s also about being active politically. All these things bode well for Berlin’s club culture not going under.”Meanwhile, Griessmuehle has appended the words “im Exil” to its name and found a couple of temporary homes. Garavelloni and Turco are still looking for a new venue to host Cocktail d’Amore. Griessmuehle is a hard act to follow, they say. When the music finally went off at the club for the last time, the dancefloor was still packed. “People really loved Griessmuehle, they had some of the best experiences of their lives there. Knowing that this would have been the last Cocktail there created an incredible celebratory energy, ultimate joy mixed with ultimate sadness. The people on the dancefloor didn’t want to let go of the place. They didn’t want to let go of that beautiful, though sad, moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab419c5db5fad0615db03de0284dde24577e3c57/34_145_1966_1179/master/1966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02bb9a3ca3fcf9713404c719657a52bf","title":"lewis capaldi review apollo manchester","story":"Apollo, ManchesterResembling an 80s darts player, the larky Scot starts his biggest tour yet with his patented blend of goofy humour and heartbreaking balladsAs Lewis Capaldi is fond of observing, he’s the last person you’d expect to become the biggest new pop star in the country. With his satin tour jacket and bedraggled mousy hair, the 23-year-old looks as if he stumbled across a picture of 1980s darts legend Eric Bristow and declared, “That’s the image!” His stage banter includes telling the audience, “I’ve got the shits. I’m going to try and get through the show without pooing my pants.” Titling last year’s debut Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent didn’t stop the album – and mammoth single Someone You Loved – becoming 2019’s biggest seller.The Scot was apparently discovered by his manager after uploading songs to SoundCloud, a heartwarming tale of DIY that belies the teams of co-songwriters (including crack production trio TMS) behind his smashes. Which doesn’t make Capaldi any less genuine or funny, to the point that he could cut it as a comic if he weren’t making such a fine fist of being a fantastic, characterful pop star. It takes him just two numbers to trigger screaming Capaldimania. The waving arms and crowd singalongs are reminiscent of a cup final, or how 1970s punters remember gigs by Rod Stewart and the Faces.As with young Sir Roderick, there’s a chasm between Capaldi’s boozy, sweary, jokey persona and the hurting soul in song. He dismisses his breakup anthems as “fucking depressing”, but the sadder they are, the louder the crowd sing with him. Each tune is tailored to his epic, Joe Cocker bellow. Hollywood perfectly skewers the feeling when a relationship is dying (“When you’re just a step away from falling apart, do you ever feel like going back to the start?”) while Bruises dissects the aftermath. Someone You Loved is raw and real – “I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug, I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved.” The song’s devastated heartbreak isn’t at all diminished by the singer leading into it by wearing a pair of comedy plastic sunglasses, to look as goofy as he can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c3082aaa8f8f9771fdb3e2a33864936b54a3de/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c5c0843800c3816ae1938c61002e14e","title":"who should lead labour podcast","story":"Ballots went out to Labour members this week as the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader intensifies.

Perfect for the techy on the slopes.For the show-off, the mountain is a mere background wallpaper in the story of their life, the gondola is a place to do their makeup, and their skis purely a means of transport to push from one epic selfie spot to another. Of which there are so many all around.The show-off works best on bluebird days and hides in the hotel during photographically challenging blizzards or whiteouts. They used to hang out at the snow park taking selfies at the top of the half pipe until someone pushed them off the lip one day. They got stuck in the centre and had to be pulled out by mountain rescue on a skidoo. Still, it made a good Instagram story.Tips for show-offs: Keep your phone in an inside jacket pocket as close to your body as possible, as cold temperatures will make your battery run out more quickly.Resort pick: Club Med Val Thorens is the perfect base to tick off the 3 Vallées selfie spot trail.“How hard can it be?” thought the first-timer. They’d seen Ski Sunday and watched a couple of YouTube tutorials on the flight over. The first-timer was used to success, unaccustomed to failure, which might explain why they asked for expert skis at the hire shop. And then proceeded to almost twist a knee when their binding didn’t release during a pile-up, which they themselves had caused by skiing into a group getting off the chairlift.At least it saved them from taking on the icy black run they were about to attempt, though. The lifties bundled the first-timer back down the way they came, to the safety of the green runs and covered magic carpet. And there they skied, with their bum in the air as is the form for all beginners who don’t have lessons, being overtaken by kids half their size, until the end of their holiday.Tips for first-timers: Get lessons. There’s no shame in ski school. It’s the quickest way to progress, and even advanced skiers will improve with some tailored tuition. And thanks to Club Med’s partnership with Ecole du Ski Français (ESF), customers get free lessons (available Monday to Friday).Après-ski royalty does not care about first lifts. They’re not even sure they exist, though they did hear someone mention the concept once. Just before midday is when après-ski royalty likes to head up the mountain to avoid the afternoon lift pass rush. Queues are not their scene at all.They might do a red run, a quick head-clearer, with a pace and poise that belies the little amount of time they actually spend on snow rather than in the bar. And then it’s time to settle down for lunch at a sunny outdoor deck with a cocktail or two, moving to each new après spot like clockwork with the sun as it shifts around the mountain.At three, it’s time for the VIP bar at La Folie Douce, where they’ll dance on a table draped in a sea of feather boas. Obvs. As the sun starts to set, après-ski royalty styles it down the mountain and heads home.Tips for après-ski royalty: Research happy hour slots and the best après spots in advance so you can plan your route with precision.Resort pick: Club Med Alpe d’Huez is a top resort for après-ski vibes, with one of the finest Folie Douce in the Alps.The new parents stand at the top of the chairlift scratching their heads. They’re sure they’ve forgotten something. Gloves, poles, phone, oh yes, they remember, we have a child now! But it’s OK, she’s in nursery today. Blinking into the morning sun, the dad remembers he left his goggles on the changing mat, while the mum wonders if the white on her jacket is milk, baby sick or snow.Then they push off – it feels weird at first, but they embrace their newfound freedom, skiing together in the endless white. It’s just like the old days, except this morning they have the slopes to themselves as only new parents and powder hounds are up this early.They’re exhausted by lunchtime and downing double espressos to get through the afternoon, but they return to their child with a sparkle in their eyes. They only planned to use the odd day of nursery, but they sign their beloved up for the rest of the week.Tips for new parents: All-inclusive snow trips are a great option for families with young children, thanks to their on-site nurseries, child-friendly meal provision, and day-long kids’ clubs.Resort pick: Club Med Les Arcs Panorama, where the Club Med has one of the best childcare setups in the Alps.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b79e90e9569133d7cce95f37dec74b85f069d02/0_354_5314_3189/master/5314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92424137c2aa5cc8cc1016ca7a6ab07d","title":"win an all inclusive ski holiday for two","story":"Enjoy a luxurious week in the snow with an all-inclusive week-long stay in the new Club Med Alpe d’Huez resort – enter now for your chance to winSki season is here and the mountains are calling.

Narrow down your search with these tipsThere are more than 5,000 ski resorts in the world, in more than 50 different countries. So how on earth do you begin to find the right one for you? The choice of destination can be overwhelming, let alone picking an inidual resort. And don’t expect Google to have the answer. Unless the question is: “Which ski resorts are best at search engine optimisation?”Here’s everything you need to know about skiing in France, Switzerland and Japan.Family-friendly fun in FranceTypical ski season: December-MayThe appeal is helped by France’s proximity to the UK, which means short flight times and plenty of low-cost airline choice, along with the opportunity to drive or take the environmentally-friendly train option.And French resorts are especially good for family snow trips, thanks to their English-speaking ski schools, tailored beginner areas and fun snow parks for kids. Many resorts also have an impressive array of non-ski activities to keep things enjoyable for children.Nestled in an enchanted pine forest at 1,750 metres, Club Med Les Arcs Panorama is a great choice for families, as it’s right on the slopes and has children’s classes and clubs available from four months up. Kids will love the playful animal sculptures dotted around the property, the ski trails through the woods and the resort’s famed toboggan runs.A luxury treat in SwitzerlandTypical ski season: November-MaySkiing in Switzerland is for those who want to push the boat out – a place of chocolate box beauty, where time appears to have stood still. But its popularity with Britons is also because it boasts some of the best ski resorts in Europe, with great pistes for all levels, excellent snow records, and renowned ski schools.Saint-Moritz was the world’s first winter sports resort and continues to have a reputation for glitz and glamour. By staying at the Club Med Saint-Moritz Roi Soleil you can enjoy all the chicness from a safe distance, knowing the price of your all-inclusive holiday was fixed in advance. The resort is linked to the extensive Engadin valley, and off-piste activities include Nordic skiing, riding in horse-drawn carriages and cosy fondue suppers.Crowd-free adventures in JapanTypical ski season: December-MarchHeading to Japan is the ultimate choice for adventurous skiers and snowboarders who want a fresh and original take on their winter break. Yes, you have to travel farther, but once you’re there Japan will more than deliver on the experience, as more and more British travellers are discovering each year.Hokkaido in the north of the country is the premier spot for skiing and snowboarding. Expect uncrowded slopes, plentiful fresh powder snow, phenomenal food, and unique insights into Japanese culture. Club Med’s Tomamu Hokkaido gives you ski-in ski-out access to Tomamu Mountain, a mix of cultural exploration and a great snow experience. Enjoy the 145 hectares of powder to play in, thaw out in a Japanese onsen and learn how to make sushi from the resort chef.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df356cc555b3a4174172a31bb9f23927c672e7f3/609_935_7304_4382/master/7304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=606fd377c337acc4d10259866500d972","title":"pali hungin doctors technology ai medics role vital","story":"Imagine a world where the doctors we see today no longer exist. This is what Professor Pali Hungin, who heads up the the Changing Face of Medicine (CFM) project, is grappling with as rapid societal and technological developments outpace traditional medical training. Gone are the days of passive patients with low expectations 20 years ago, for example, few of us would have imagined that we would be seeking health advice from mobile phone devices. Meanwhile, technology, artificial intelligence, and other new sciences, such as genomics, are altering medicine fast.It’s why Hungin and his colleagues believe that medical education, practice, and the traditional role of the doctor needs a radical rethink. He and colleagues involved in the commission are busy re-imagining a possible vision of what clinicians and medical practice will look like in the next 20 years. “There is a thought that looking into the distant future, the doctor as a professional as trained today may not need to exist. So a person who is not well may see a diagnostician who needn’t necessarily be trained traditionally as a doctor,” says Hungin. “The diagnostician may be armed with AI and machine learning technology, and might be able to take the necessary steps.”“And then if any interventions are required – and we know that for example, practical interventions like surgery are now advancing rapidly in terms of robotics and so on – so you could argue that the person who performs those interventions, again, need not necessarily be a traditionally trained doctor.”The CFM project is less a case of turkeys voting for Christmas, and more an acute awareness that sociological and technological shifts have put doctors under severe strain. Far from dispensing prescriptions, the commission is seeking to encourage dialogue around how these challenges can best be met. Hungin believes the profession is in a transitional phase and heading towards a “completely different world”. Set up 18 months ago, it’s a collaboration hosted by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. The project has been funded by the Wesleyan Foundation and some initial monies from the British Medical Association.The medical profession has always adapted to change, says Hungin, but it is being overtaken by certain developments that are leading to symptoms of “dissonance” such as disillusionment and burnout. Doctors, traditionally trained in a certain way, “have been struggling to find a role for ourselves in this new age,” he says. The old top-down doctor-patient relationship has not been valid for some while: patients are more informed about treatments, and have higher expectations. Traditional doctor-training, meanwhile, now seems to many out of step. High levels of work pressure mean that an increasing number of doctors do not want to work full time anymore. Overall, supply of staff working in medicine cannot meet current levels of demand.Hungin cites a survey conducted last year by the Royal Medical Benevolent Fund, of which he is a trustee, which found that a high proportion of doctors would discourage their children from going into medicine. Why? Because they found it an unfulfilling, difficult and stressful career, he says. Therein lies the problem.Hungin’s medical record dates back to the analogue world of 1970, when he arrived from Kenya to study medicine at Newcastle University, where he is now emeritus professor of general practice. He trained as a GP, later juggling the role with a range of academic endeavours. In 2016, he used his tenure as president of the British Medical Association to lead a year-long international project into the impact of the fast-changing environment on doctors’ sense of vocation, their professional values and their relationship with patients and the public.He has continued this through the CFM commission, which has working groups looking atfive separate themes public-patient-doctor engagement technology, informatics and AI clinician wellbeing rethinking medical education and leadership. Last week, around 80 people were invited to attend a CFM conference organised by Hungin to discuss how clinicians and medical practice will evolve. The chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, was among those in attendance. A report will follow.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, wants the NHS to be more tech-focused. Last summer, Boris Johnson announced £250m for the use of AI in the NHS. Hungin welcomes the funding, but says that this emphasis “might start to detract” from the importance of investing in the human element of healthcare. The greater the technological leaps, the greater the need for human contact to help people make sense of their difficulties, their diagnosis and their most appropriate course of action, the commission has found. Who provides that human contact is another matter.Hungin doesn’t believe that doctors will become obsolete, but he does see “new roles” emerging that are neither the traditional model of a nurse or a doctor. They will be a “highly modified” version of the ones we recognise today. He also thinks we will have to manage with fewer of them.“We know that the public and patients appreciate having someone else to have an interaction with, and we can’t replace that someone else with technology alone,” he says. “Whether that person needs to be a traditionally trained doctor is a reasonable question to ask. If your role is to operate on a particular part of the body, using highly specialised machinery and skills and techniques specific to that particular procedure, then do you have to go through all the traditional steps of medical training as we have now, plus the years of an apprenticeship-based model, in order to establish your competence?”Yet youngsters who aspire to become doctors have no reason to feel downcast. Hungin insists that this is “the most exciting time of all” to train as a doctor, because genomics and the like will help patients receive highly personalised care.Would he recommend the route to any future grandchildren? “Yes. Undoubtedly so,” he replies. “If I had the opportunity to retrain as a doctor now, I would grab it with both hands.”Education: Highway secondary school, Nairobi, Kenya Newcastle University Medical School (MBBS and MD) Diploma of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.Career: 2018-present: lead, Changing Face of Medicine Commission, Academy of Medical Royal Colleges 2017-18: professor of primary care and general practice, faculty of medical sciences, Newcastle University 2016-17: president, British Medical Association 2003-14: dean of medicine, Durham University 2001-2005: chair, NHS Research and Development Forum, England 1980-2014: general practitioner, Stockton-on-Tees 1983-1996: hospital practitioner, James Cook university hospital, Middlesbrough.

So we’re all buzzing really.”Glenn, who at 20 is playing in her first ever World Cup, has been one of the success stories of the tournament so far for England, with six wickets across the group stages including a return of three for 15 in their must-win fixture against Pakistan in Canberra.She is now gearing up for the biggest match of her fledgling international career, which began only three months ago against Pakistan in Malaysia, and says that the tournament has helped confirm that she made the right decision to quit hockey – which she played internationally at junior level – in favour of cricket.“I’m very happy with my decision. I’m really excited to be part of this team,” she said. “The expectation of playing in a semi-final is quite daunting, but I’m just excited to be here. We’re prepared for whatever is thrown at us.”The match will be a repeat of the 2018 tournament semi-final, which England won by eight wickets courtesy of half-centuries from Nat Sciver and Amy Jones. Sciver, who has hit three half-centuries in this tournament and is the overall leading run-scorer with 202 to her name, looks likely to again play a key role. Jones, meanwhile, is relishing her newly-adopted “finisher” position, having dropped down from the opener spot to bat at No 6 against West Indies, against whom she contributed 23 from 13 balls.For England, the biggest call for the captain, Heather Knight, will be whether to continue with a three-pronged spin attack, as they did against West Indies on Sunday, or to omit the off-spinner Mady Villiers in favour of an extra batter, Lauren Winfield, who played in the first three group matches but faced only five balls. Though the SCG has a reputation for producing slow wickets, England’s decision will likely not be made until the last minute, given that rain is forecast. “The weather’s quite unpredictable at the moment, so we’ve just got to see on the day what we think it will play like,” Glenn said.India have already shown themselves a force to be reckoned with in the tournament, finishing top of their group after a shock 17-run win against reigning champions Australia in the opening match. The star of that performance was the leg-spinner Poonam Yadav, who is also the tournament’s leading wicket-taker to date.She is likely to prove a formidable threat to the England batting lineup, who aside from Sciver and Knight have generally under-performed across the tournament. India’s 16-year-old opening batter Shafali Verma, whose 161 runs in the tournament have come at the phenomenal strike rate of 161, will also threaten England’s chances of progressing to the final, which takes place at the MCG on Sunday 8 March.Glenn says England are taking heart from their most recent encounter against India, in February during their tri-series with Australia. On that occasion England restricted them to 123 for six and chased down the runs with an over and four wickets to spare. “They’re a top team with a lot of talent but the fact that we got to play them in the tri-series and win a match against them really helps our confidence,” Glenn said.One concern for England will be the poor weather, which on Tuesday completely wiped out the final game of Group B, between South Africa and West Indies. There is no reserve day in place for either semi-final, which means that England – who finished second in their group – would be automatically knocked out should the encounter be a wash out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa8ed1451a56f9b971de4123a89c2cd7aa1e170/0_14_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812af785f90ba21c4f9a2c9418c75e69","title":"heaven fitch female wrestler north carolina","story":"Heaven Fitch, 16, has made national headlines after becoming the first girl to win a North Carolina high school wrestling title and an emerging role model for young female grapplersHeaven Fitch just wanted to be like her three older brothers. At six years old, she followed them onto the wrestling mat and she hasn’t stopped since. Two weeks ago, she became the first girl in North Carolina to win an inidual state men’s wrestling championship.Fitch, 16, is the only girl on Uwharrie Charter Academy’s 26-person team in Asheboro, where she recently finished her 11th-grade season with a 54-4 record. She was also named Most Outstanding Wrestler for North Carolina’s 1A ision. Last year, Fitch placed fourth in the state’s high school wrestling championships.“It definitely feels pretty good to pin a guy,” she told the .Originally from Illinois, Fitch and her siblings grew up watching WWE pro wrestling on Saturday mornings, then recreating the matches wherever they could find room. Not one to keep on the sidelines, Heaven was always in the thick of it. When she asked her parents if she could join the kids’ wrestling club as its only girl, they didn’t hesitate. She had proven her mettle taking punishment from her brothers. “My parents are probably the ones who pushed me the most,” Fitch said. “They always encouraged me.”Alongside her brothers, Heaven competed wherever she could. When the school season ended, the Fitch kids would continue to practice and compete in the circuit outside of it, an intricate track of junior tournaments that eventually lead to Olympic contention. Fitch often practiced five days a week. Sometimes she attended two practices in a day. “Every Saturday there would be a tournament, and sometimes I’d be back in the wrestling room on Sundays,” she said.When she and her family moved from the Charlotte area to Asheboro, Fitch’s parents met with her new coach, Chris Waddell, to make sure she would fit and thrive in the school’s program. “You could tell she was talented right away,” Waddell said. “She was one of the hardest workers, if not the hardest worker on the team.”Her wrestling partner put her through her paces and her strong work ethic won her the respect and trust of the group. One day, a boy talked to her. Then the rest followed.The petite Fitch wrestles in the 106lb (48kg) ision. She walks around at 102lb, and doesn’t have to cut weight like many of her male opponents. This often plays to her disadvantage since wrestlers commonly make weight through dehydration, then are able to pack back on a few extra pounds with fluids.For her history-making turn two weeks ago, the weight limit was increased to 110lb within regulation. Fitch weighed in at 102lb her opponents at 110lb. Once rehydrated, her opponents likely weighed closer to 115lb when they met her on the canvas.Fitch compensates with agility and a tenacious, but controlled pace. She’s proven to be an asset and last year, the team went 41-0.“She’s mentally tough,” Waddell said. “At this age, I think the only thing that’s equal to the boys is core strength. Everything else – leg strength, arm strength – the boys will be stronger.”Fitch’s gender-inspiring win has garnered heavy media attention. She has fielded inquiries from major news outlets around the country. A clip of her state victory went viral. In a podium picture that made the rounds, the silver-haired Fitch beamed from her first-place step, flanked by the less-enthused boys she bested.“Last year people didn’t know who she was and they shook their heads when she came out,” Waddell said. “This year everybody knows her.”Fitch described the attention she has received as “overwhelming”, but it hasn’t detracted from her goal to study medicine in college, whether or not the institution she chooses has a women’s wrestling program. She said she is considering a focus on psychiatry, psychology or biology.“I know I could continue to wrestle in college, but it’s juggling the academics that I need with being able to do this,” Fitch said.Waddell believes Fitch could earn an academic scholarship to the University of North Carolina, which houses one of the stronger men’s teams in the country. Though there is no women’s team, many female national team competitors train there under the tutelage of the legendary Kenny Monday, the 2008 Olympic gold medalist in freestyle.Wrestling is the only sport Fitch has ever competed in. She is a straight-A student, sings and plays the ukulele. She listens to alternative music and wears flannel shirts.The sport continues to be a family affair. Fitch’s oldest brother helped coach her Eagles’ squad this season. Her middle brother has been state placer for North Carolina State University in Raleigh.In March, Fitch will compete in the Virginia Beach National Championship – a rare occasion where she will wrestle other girls. In the off-season, she will pick her training back up again for the world team trials. Whether she decides to pursue wrestling after her senior year or not, her victory, and the attention it has received, will continue to push the women’s wrestling movement forward. She has become a role model. A girl from the local middle school team will join her next year. Six more girls will follow behind them.“Heaven is one of a kind,” Waddell said. “A great wrestler, a great musician. Most important, she’s a good person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8539356630457d7e8ca63f6745334ebf24dd26/0_163_5118_3071/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67570684837234c7b6ae09ad60ba34e9","title":"european cricket series the spin","story":"A new 10-over series beginning this week is hoping to inspire a ‘huge untapped cricket-loving market in mainland Europe’Monday’s launch of This is Europe, the ’s series focusing on, well, Europe, handily coincided with the launch of a new competition that organisers hope will transform the way cricket is perceived on the continent. The new era for the game dawned in the unlikely location of Alicante on Spain’s Costa Blanca, where in balmy temperatures but howling gales the Dream11 European Cricket Series got under way in front of a small crowd of local enthusiasts and a potential global audience of millions.None of the players involved – this week’s teams are Sporting Alfas (the hosts), Alicante Intellectuals, La Manga, Levante, Madrid United and the Pinatar Pirates – are household names quite yet, but there’s time for that. With every minute broadcast live on FanCode, where the competition sits only slightly uneasily alongside the NBA and NFL – for which the site holds Indian streaming rights – as well as I-League football and ACC Twenty20, there will certainly be plenty of exposure. The title sponsor, Dream11, is an Indian fantasy sports platform that already works with La Liga, the NBA and the IPL, and it comes from the same fevered imagination as the European Cricket League, which held a small-scale but successful debut event last year.“I believe there’s a huge untapped cricket-loving market in mainland Europe that’s been asleep for many, many years,” says Daniel Weston, the expat Australian who is the driving force behind the competition. “My belief is there’s around 20 million cricket fans in mainland Europe that have just never had the opportunity to play or watch games that are being livestreamed and broadcast. We held a three-day event last year and what we saw was a huge amount of love and passion for the game that was ignited. But the problem is it’s such a short time in the whole year.”The idea for a tournament that could run from the start of spring to the depths of autumn was hatched only last October. A little over four months later six teams, four cameras and a game group of commentators gathered for its debut, the first of 400 matches Weston hopes will be played over 100 days of competitive action spread across the next six months. The competition has been organised so quickly that as it starts its conclusion remains unplanned, with future weeks in Frankfurt and Hamburg to be followed by one in Prague, while beyond that it is hoped that, once word spreads, other European locations with passable pitches, a few plug sockets and decent internet connections will raise their hands. “I can talk about it and people are a bit conservative, or I can actually produce it and people say: ‘We have to host that,’” Weston suggests.Like in the ECL teams play innings of 10 overs each, reducing matches to an ultra-streamlined 90-minute duration (and thus making the sport an easier sell to football fans). Every week will feature a round-robin, followed by semi-finals, a final and the presentation of a handsome trophy (though this week’s is currently stuck in customs). Like in tennis, inidual tournaments can run alongside an overall title race. “The problem with cricket is the rules are so damn hard it’s not filtered into sporting TV channels,” says Weston. “People think the game’s too long and the rules are hard to understand. That’s what I’m trying to change with T10 – it’s all done in 90 minutes, just hit the ball as hard as you can. What I’ve found is that in T10 you get similar scores to T20 but also at the top of every hour there can be a new game or a new innings starting. It’s a beautiful spectacle.”Weston’s background is in finance – in 2013 he founded a hedge fund, Aimed Capital (Aimed stands for Aspiration, Inspiration, Motivation and Dedication) – but he played in Western Australia’s second XI before moving to Europe, where he eventually started playing for Germany and through them glimpsed a gap in the sports broadcast market. “I was playing for Germany against Sweden and when we won the match the brother of one of the players started livestreaming us walking off the field, and thousands of people were watching a livestream of a German cricket team walking off a field,” he says. “In 2016 I financed some cameras to come to one of our practice matches – the idea was to film the game, but the power didn’t work and the cameraman didn’t know what cricket was or where to point the camera. But I cut together some highlights and they ended up being seen by 700,000 people on Facebook. I thought, there’s something here.”He started putting out social media clips, which appears to have led to a Teutonic cricket boom as fans of the game who assumed no one played it in Germany saw the error of their ways. A serendipitous meeting with a couple of people who worked on Uefa’s Champions League during its gestation helped him on his way – “I’m literally meeting the guys who started the greatest competition in European football – what I need to do is start the Champions League of European cricket” – and last year the first, eight-team European Cricket League, complete with professional-standard livestreaming, was won by VOC Rotterdam. This year’s event will last twice as long and feature twice as many teams, from 15 countries, while the ECS makes continental European cricket a more long-term proposition.“I want T10 to be played more and more, I need more clubs in Europe playing,” says Weston. “More games of cricket will inspire more players and more parents to say, now there’s a reason to teach my kids how to hit a ball. I just want to see the game grow and develop. What I believe we can do is make cricket the No 1 bat-and-ball sport in Europe. It’s a long-term vision, which can only happen if people see it and get involved. I believe if we start livestreaming it’ll make club cricket stronger, which means more kids get involved, which means more people watching and more sponsors. The only way people are going to invest in cricket is if people can see it.”• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email.

The £280 Monitor II ANC are no exception.The headphones fully enclose your ear with medium-sized cups, comfortable pads and a firm but evenly distributed grip on your head. The headband is lined with leatherette-covered foam and does a good job of staying put without too much pressure on your skull.Despite being Marshall’s largest headphones, the Monitor II are comparatively small and discreet with a relatively low profile on your head that’s very welcome. The ear cups are held by sturdy-feeling metal arms with a full range of articulation that slide in and out of the headband, clicking into place for a comfortable fit.They fold up in a number of different ways, making them some of the most compact and easy to pack full-size headphones for travelling.Marshall’s best-in-class control joystick returns. Press it in for pauseplay, up and down for volume, or left and right for track skip. Why others don’t copy this brilliant method of controls on headphones I have no idea.Two buttons on the back hinges of the ear cups take care of noise-cancelling modes and switching the equaliser between three user-selectable pre-sets. Press the noise-cancelling button to switch between active noise cancelling (ANC) and ambient sound modes or press and hold to turn it off.The headphones have a traditional 3.5mm socket and ship with a detachable cable that can be used with or without the power on.The Bluetooth connection to an iPhone 11 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and OnePlus 7 Pro 5G was strong and skip-free. But Marshall has taken a backward step, only supporting the most basic SBC Bluetooth audio codec.All Apple, Android and Windows devices support the improved AAC codec, while the latter pair also support aptX: a more advanced codec Marshall used in previous headphones. The better the Bluetooth audio codec, the higher the quality of audio. Thankfully, I saw no lip-sync problems with any of the common video-playing apps across Android, iOS and even YouTube in Microsoft’s Edge browser on Windows 10.Call quality was good. The recipient’s voice came through clear and loud in the headphones, while my voice was audible with a good amount of sidetone. The other end of the call said my voice was loud, clear and crisp, even if a little background noise seeped in intermittently.ANC uses inverse sound waves to cancel out unwanted noise before it hits your eardrum and has become bare minimum for high-end wireless headphones.By default, ANC is turned up to maximum on the headphones but you can turn it down in the Marshall app if you want more awareness of your surroundings. It works fine for cancelling out the rumble of an engine, and fairly well on road noise, but it is not very good at dealing with speech, meaning they are not the best for simply concentrating in an office or blocking out noisy commuters.The headphones also struggle to deal with wind noise, making listening to music in a gusty environment difficult. Turning off noise cancelling was the best option.Overall, Bose, B\u0026ampW and Sony have nothing to fear here, so if super-effective noise cancelling is your primary driver, best to look elsewhere.Marshall’s headphones have a particular sound that people love. Often they are best suited to rock, with a raw, grungy sound that’s exciting and full of energy. The Monitor II headphones also have that sound but are better at dealing with other genres of music, too, sounding almost as good with driving electronica or background lounge, while giving large orchestral scores a good go.The “Marshall sound” equaliser is active by default, which produces their best sound with an overall warm tone, fairly controlled bass and full-blooded mids, while highs are a little muted in places. The soundscape is surprisingly wide, giving a good immersive listening experience for big pieces, while there is a good amount of separation between instruments and tones keeping things clear when tracks get a bit intense.They do not quite rival the very best, such as B\u0026ampW’s PX7, but if you like Marshall’s warm, rock-focused sound, you will love the Monitor II.Battery life is so long you may forget you ever have to charge them. The Monitor II headphones are designed to last up to 30 hours with noise cancelling active and 45 hours with it off, which seemed a little conservative in my testing.That is easily enough to cover any flight or most weekly commutes without needing to charge. They take two hours to fully charge via USB-C but a 15-minute top-up will add about five hours playback if you do happen to forget to charge them.You cannot use the USB-C port for audio but you can charge them and listen to them at the same time.The headphones are not made from any recycled material but are made from responsibly sourced materials.The Marshall Monitor II ANC are a set of rocking headphones that look every bit the part.Despite being full-sized headphones, they are fairly slimline, with classic styling that sets them apart. They are robust, fold up to be much more compact than rivals and are far more comfortable than many – if you want to rock out for hours on end, they have the fit to make sure you can last as long as their 30 to 45-hour battery will.They have a sound that is slightly more refined than previous Marshall headphones, making them sound good for a wider range of genres, but the warm sound is still best with a trashing guitar packing plenty of punch and raw energy.They are not perfect, though. The active noise cancellation works for general drone but struggles with voices. They only support the standard SBC Bluetooth audio standard, not higher quality codecs practically every device is capable of using such as AAC or aptX, which is a backward step for the brand.They are certainly not cheap, and you can get a similar Marshall experience from the brand’s excellent Major III series of headphones for about half the price, but the Monitor II ANC are a warm, inviting listen that’s hard to put down.Pros: look great, fold down really compact, comfortable for very long listening sessions, long battery life, brilliant controls, great sound, decent noise cancelling, headphone socket, stable Bluetooth connectionCons: only SBC, expensive, noise cancelling struggles with wind and voices This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Walking into his New York apartment, he sounds flustered. He has just been to the supermarket, which, as he tells us in series two of Joe Pera Talks With You, is a very personal place, a living theatre where “there’s always a show going on” and man must face his limits: “Can I eat this? Will I eat this? Can I afford it?” In the episode, his character reads his shopping list then stops. “That’s too much information,” he says in his folksy mumble. Today, the real-life Pera already had porridge for breakfast. “But I had to run out and get something more hearty,” he says warily, as if I’ve asked him something much more probing.Set in northern Michigan, Pera’s Adult Swim comedy showcases the small, beloved pleasures of the choir teacher he portrays. As a rule, anything Larry David hates, Pera would probably love: there are episodes about grocery stores and rocks on sleeping during a storm and the science of stacking “the perfect egg bite” on your fork at breakfast. It’s a show about community and contentment. Most importantly, it is wildly funny, endearing and profound. “It is said that if you put time and effort into your garden, you will be rewarded,” Pera says in an episode about beans. “But this is hardly true, and I have been devastated in the past.”In an era of manic comedy, this beautifully strange proposition – closer in spirit to Mister Rogers’s Neighborhood than anything else on the transgressive Adult Swim – has become a balm. Pera’s character is like a human Mr Snuffleupagus, with an aversion to conflict that almost sees him sell his house after a For Sale sign accidentally ends up in his lawn. On the phone, he speaks haltingly, and finishes answers with a tidy note of conclusion, as if fastening his top button. The fictional Pera’s job is the only apparent gap between them. “I didn’t wanna do a show where I was a comedian in New York City because that’s been done a million times,” he says. “I thought: if I didn’t go into comedy, what would my life have been like?”The show started with an animated episode, Joe Pera Talks You to Sleep, in which he does precisely that with a succession of bewitchingly dull stories about barns and baseball (Adult Swim created a 10-hour loop for true insomniacs). It came out in spring 2016 – a year when many people might have struggled to nod off. They didn’t consider that when writing, says Pera, although they ended up shooting another special, Joe Pera Helps You Find the Perfect Christmas Tree, on election night. “Everybody woke up in a very strange mood and we just shot trees and scenery.” He sighs: “It’s not addressing the issue straight on, but it was nice to look at trees for the day. I hope that maybe that sense of calm that we felt during the production can help people feel a sense of calm when they watch.”Gentleness remains a guiding principle. “Could somebody watch this 11-minute episode, then close their eyes and have a great night’s sleep with sweet dreams?” Pera says. “A couple of people in England told me that they fall asleep listening to the BBC shipping forecast, so it’s like that, but with jokes.” (He says he’s considering a future episode where his character turns into a turtle.)It is an antidote to the hysteria of modern life in a sea of toxic masculinity, Pera cuts a benign figure, though he isn’t into the idea that the show is in any way political. “Act decent to one another?” he says when asked what its ethos is. “I don’t know.” Clearly uncomfortable with deeper readings, he says it is just the show he would want to watch. He is happy when fans say they watch it with their families, like a festive film. “My ideal world is made of kids and old people only,” he says, with a faint chuckle, “and we do that a lot, which I don’t think a ton of shows do.”Pera counts his grandparents among his formative influences. They starred in his early videos, which distinguished him from his peers, he says. More importantly, Grandpa Jerry (“Kind of a ham”) and Nana Josephine (“One of the funniest people I know or have seen, even among comedians”) loved performing and he loved their company. It’s obvious: Pera, often uneasy in conversation, talks about them in extensively fond detail. “And,” he says, “if you work with your grandparents, they’ll make you lunch afterwards.”With the show, he and his co-writers have to make “every bit of the 11 minutes count”. Its best episode is Joe Pera Reads the Church Announcements, in which he discovers the Who’s Baba O’Riley and loses his mind: throwing tissues, manically eating ice-cream and encouraging his fellow, elderly churchgoers to join him in a moving rendition. It’s the perfect distillation of how it feels to obsess over a song. Licensing the track broke the budget, but Adult Swim loved the episode and waved it through. (Pera doesn’t know if any of the Who have seen it.)For season two, more episodes meant bigger stories, including Pera’s relationship with a doomsday prepper who forces him to confront the scary things in life. After setting the first season in autumn and winter, this season is about spring (Pera ranks Easter “the third most romantic day of the year”) and summer, to show off Michigan’s nature and because it means they’re not filming in -7C. The more time he spends there, the more tempted he is to move: “That alternate life where I have a backyard and 12 kids.”While prosaic, the fictional Pera’s way of life is almost fantastically fulfilled. If the show has a message, this is it, he says. He mentions legendary US sitcom writer Norman Lear, who said he goes to sleep each night “anticipating and delighting in the great taste” of his morning coffee. “I can relate. I’m not a millionaire like him, but sometimes you can’t beat that feeling of waking up and drinking a cup of coffee.” He considerately adapts for regional difference. “You guys drink tea. A nice cup of tea in the morning. That moment, if you allow it to be good – that’s enough.”Joe Pera Talks With You seasons one and two are available now on All4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92c8edbc5fc65f01141430543183b19218680cd/0_1411_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5925fd83c3dbf2e22e8d1aca0d9ef44","title":"miriam margolyes like men dont feel groin excitement","story":"The irrepressible actor loves to give people ‘a jolt’. She talks about her weight, the joy of being a lesbian – and why she sits on people on the tubeIs she, Miriam Margolyes would like to know, how I expected her to be? She is. “Everybody says that,” she replies, a little sadly. But isn’t it good to go through the world being utterly yourself? She smiles. “I know, but it would be so nice to surprise people.” Even if you know what to expect – anyone who has seen one of her regular appearances on The Graham Norton Show knows how gloriously naughty she is – Margolyes, up close, is still quite something. I point out to her that we have been talking for only 10 minutes and already she has answered the phone (to a child, she later finds out) with a terrifying, booming: “Who are you?”. Meanwhile, I’ve spotted the remnants of a chewed onion on a plate, which she ate, like an apple, for lunch (“You mean you don’t?”). She looks pleased.There is something bracing and delightfully scandalous about Margolyes. It’s not an eccentricity that has grown with age – she has always been like this, it seems. According to the actor Tony Robinson, in one of her first acting jobs she turned up late to rehearsals, apologised and said she had been “wanking off” a park-keeper. Why does she like behaving so badly? “It is true that in shocking people, there is a kind of delight in people’s: ‘Did she say that?’ I think giving people a bit of a jolt is good.”I meet Margolyes in her flat in south London, which looks out on to her lovely garden. She is 78 and shrinking, she says – she has lost an inch and is now 4ft 10in – but there is nothing diminished about her. Her career is marching along nicely – her forthright Mother Mildred in Call the Midwife has brought her to primetime TV, and her role as Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films made her famous with a new generation, even though she has said she doesn’t like children very much.Her force-of-nature personality – her empathy, warmth and hilarious openness – has been perfect for her new direction presenting documentaries. Her latest, Miriam’s Big Fat Adventure, for BBC Two, will be a two-parter looking at the obesity crisis and the body-positive movement and exploring her own relationship with her weight.“I’ve been fat all my life and I wanted to work out why,” she says. “Could I change? And how do other people cope with it?” Being overweight “has affected and infected every part of my life. It made me less attractive, sexually. It made me miserable often as an adolescent.” It also made her develop her sense of humour, “because you can’t go around miserable all the time, so you have to make people laugh. I think it made me quite aggressive on occasion because I won’t be bullied.”Margolyes started putting weight on when she was about eight or nine. “By the time I had my periods, when I was 11, I had a 36in bust, which was the focus of much attention from the American soldiers around the place.” I must look alarmed because she adds: “I didn’t mind, I thought it was wonderful.” The alarm on my face increases. “I was quite adept at saying, oh you know, “silly” or … because I wasn’t interested in it. It didn’t inflame me, but it certainly inflamed them.” The phone rings and she barks down the line to the young boy who has called – his family is staying in her Kent holiday cottage – checking he has her autograph, telling him an actress whom he almost certainly hasn’t heard of (“I don’t like her”) comes from his town, before finishing with: “Look, I have to tell you, I’m in the middle of an interview with a very important newspaper called the . Because I’ve got a television series which is coming out. So make damn sure you watch it.”At the end of the documentary, Margolyes looks emotional when she talks about how she would like to feel about her body. But what seems surprising – because it’s unusual to hear women talk like this – is that she also says she loves her face. “I think that when people look at me, they smile, and they don’t smile mockingly, they smile affectionately,” she says now. “And I love that.” It doesn’t bother her that she has never been a conventional beauty, even in an industry where that is prized. “I don’t want to be a conventional anything!” she says. It sometimes bothered her as a teenager. “I used to feel sad that nobody used to ask me out I felt very crushed by that, actually, but it didn’t last. And when I went to university, I realised that I had a spark of something that was more valuable than beauty. I had energy, and energy is always attractive.”Margolyes always knew that she was “a performer, and I love an audience”. She grew up in Oxford, the cherished only child of Joseph, a Scottish GP, and Ruth, who developed property (she rented student houses to Ken Loach and Tariq Ali). She describes their tight-knit Jewish family as “a fortress, just the three of us. It was passionate, close, adoring.”She loved doing public speaking competitions, which she always won (“That was how I first realised that I could entertain, and that was very pleasing”) and at Cambridge she joined the Footlights theatre group, where peers included John Cleese, Eric Idle and Tim Brooke-Taylor.After university, she sold encyclopedias and worked for a market research company for a couple of years while trying to make it as an actor. “I didn’t get auditions very easily because I hadn’t been to drama school,” she says it was getting cast for a BBC radio drama “that really set me going”. She has had a hugely varied career. She was in Barbra Streisand’s Yentl and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, appeared in Blackadder in the 80s, won a Bafta for her role in Martin Scorsese’s Age of Innocence and has many acclaimed theatre roles under her belt, including her one-woman show Dickens’ Women.A few months later, Margolyes’s mother had a devastating stroke Margolyes has always believed that her coming out in some way caused it, and she spent the next few years helping to look after her mother. “It was a terrible time,” she says. “I was relieved when she died. I was in hysterical grief, but I am glad that it happened because I couldn’t have taken much more – when you see somebody you love unable to speak or think or move, you’re torn in bits. It’s a terrible thing.”We talk about the television presenter Philip Schofield, who has just come out at the age of 57 (Margolyes has appeared on This Morning several times, most recently in January when Schofield and his co-presenter Holly Willoughby had to apologise for Margolyes’s use of the word “twat”). “Poor darling boy,” she says. “There are millions, unfortunately,” who feel compelled to lead a secret life. “We live in a bubble of people who don’t care what sexuality people are. But there are a great many other people in the world out there who do care and make life miserable for people because of it. And I think it’s awful.”Was her sexuality ever something she struggled to accept? “I was thrilled!” she shouts. “Ecstatic. I think it gives you an identity because you can say” – she puts on a grand voice – “‘I am a lesbian.’ It put everything into place. And it was fun. I still think it’s an absolutely terrific thing to be, which is good, because it’s not going to change.”But she must have been very hurt by the way her parents reacted. “It was terrible,” she says. “And I was very, very unhappy. I knew I couldn’t change what I was I was just unhappy that I told them. But I told them because my relationship with my mother was completely open – we had no secrets from each other.” Was she not angry with them for not accepting her? “No. They came from a world which could not adapt and that’s sad. It’s their tragedy, but it didn’t become my tragedy. I’m lucky that I’m not …” She takes a rare pause. “I’m remarkably un-bitter, really.”Margolyes has been with her partner, an Australian academic, for nearly 52 years. What is their secret? “I think love and trust, and telling the truth. Never let the sun set on a quarrel. We don’t live together, which is probably why we’ve stayed together that long. She likes to work and I do, too. Communication – you must talk to your partner.” Her partner lives in the Netherlands and they see each other only about eight times a year. “I speak to her every day on the phone, sometimes more than once.” They are currently talking about whether to live together. Would their relationship work in close proximity? “We don’t know we’d have to find out. I think so, because we really do love each other. I love her more and more.” She smiles. “I don’t know that she loves me more and more.”Do they still fancy each other after all this time? Margolyes smiles mischievously. “I don’t get wet when I look at her, if that’s what you mean,” she says. “I don’t feel physical lust, but I feel mental lust. I love talking to her, and I suppose my happiest moments, really, are just lying in bed with her and looking at the ceiling and talking. That’s my big joy.” Anyway, I say, to stay with somebody (and, I think to myself, somebody who regularly eats whole raw onions) for so long is a big achievement. “Yes, I think it is,” says Margolyes. “But I am a remarkable person.”Margolyes has always been political – and is more so now than ever, I say. “In this climate? I should think so. I’d rather not have to be, but what a collection of nasty people there are in charge of us. What a disgrace. I’m disgusted by that government.” She is, she says, alarmed by the rise of rightwing nationalism, and by the anger and hatred she sees on social media. “I know that we could have a pogrom easily in this country. It could be against Jews, it could be against Poles, it could be against Gypsies. There are people who are boiling with hate and resentment and entitlement in this country and it is alarming.”She has been vocally critical about the Israeli government over the years she says it has lost her many friends. “It’s because I say things about Israel that I consider true. If I think something is wrong, I will say it, whoever is doing it.”She was a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. How did she feel about the allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party? “I think that there is some antisemitism, but it is nowhere near as much as people say. And I think there’s plenty of antisemitism in England. People don’t like Jews. I’ve accepted that.” Antisemitism, she believes, is “widespread in the Tory party, but that’s never mentioned. Corbyn handled it badly and I regret it, because he’s a good man and he’s not an antisemite. But he should have gone, he should be out the way and let’s get on with new people.”Her wrath is reserved for the Tories. “I love British culture, I love the theatre, I love literature and the arts, the countryside, and I just feel that all the beauties of the place are being corrupted by this evil government.” She is horrified by the attacks on the BBC. “It’s outrageous. It’s vindictive,” she says, her voice rising. She cannot stand Boris Johnson. “He’s like Trump. He’s a ruthless narcissist, dangerous, drunk with power. The fact that my European citizenship has been taken away from me by that crowd of charlatans and rascals is absolutely appalling. It’s the central most miserable thing in my life at the moment.” She could always move to Australia (“wonderful country”), where she has a house and citizenship, but has ruled out living there permanently. “I will try as long as I can to have two lives. Life’s like a cream bun, you know – you want to have as much as you can.”How does she feel about getting older? “Irritated,” she says, although she concedes that people listen to her more. “They don’t see you – you’re invisible when you’re in the street – but if they’re sitting talking to you, they think you’re going to be talking sense because you’re old. And it may not be true.” She says she demands respect. “When I get into a tube train and I want to sit down and there’s no seats, I say: ‘Please, may I sit down?’ And if nobody will get up, I sit on them.” How many people has she sat on? “I think actually just one. They were surprised, and then really quite angry.” She looks delighted.Miriam’s Big Fat Adventure starts on BBC Two on 9 March at 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c386437b060bc5f78c6253144ce5453fb10df9/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0a1d46a99a8d29146727df1b08ec2b4","title":"bernie sanders latino voters","story":"‘Tio Bernie’ has a commanding lead among Latinos in the key states of California and Texas. Their support could be decisiveMaria Vallardes came to the door in slippered feet, a pomeranian yipping behind her. Standing on her porch with a clipboard and an earnest smile was Ricardo Alonzo Ugalde, a volunteer with the Bernie Sanders campaign assigned to canvas in this corner of east Los Angeles, the heart of the Latino community.“Buenas tardes, señora,” he greeted Vallardes before starting his pitch. The California primary election was Tuesday – did she plan to vote? She did. And was she a registered Democrat? She laughed, as if the question was preposterous. Of course, the 65-year-old told him in Spanish. “Do you think I would vote for Donald Trump?”She invited him inside to hear his pitch. When he left, her ballot was sealed, along with her support for Sanders.“That’s about as good as it could possibly go,” said Alonzo Ugalde, a 35-year-old engineer.“Brown people love Bernie Sanders,” said Chuck Rocha, the colorful architect of Sanders’ campaign strategy to mobilize Latino voters. “We realized that too late in 2016. So we started building where we left off.”Outreach began almost immediately after Sanders launched his campaign. In speeches, he has complemented his focus on economic inequality with calls for racial justice. And, seeking to deepen the candidate’s connection with nonwhite voters, his campaign has highlighted aspects of Sanders’ personal story as the son of a Polish immigrant who came to America without any money or knowledge of the English language.Rocha, who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Texas drawl, said the campaign learned from 2016 that it needed not only invest heavily but to invest early in Latino communities. That begins with hiring. Rocha boasts that the campaign has no “Latino department”. Instead, Latinos fill prominent, decision-making roles at every level. Under the banner of “Unidos con Bernie,” the campaign has demonstrated its “cultural competency” with Latinos, Rocha said. As part of its outreach effort, the campaign has hosted “Tamales for Tío Bernie,” screened the Disney film Coco and sponsored a soccer tournament.Super Tuesday will be the most consequential test yet of Latino support for Sanders. California and Texas are the biggest delegate prizes of the primary election and both have large Latino electorates.Surveys show Sanders with a commanding lead among Latinos in both states, but Joe Biden’s victory in South Carolina has revived his campaign and will boost his standing with voters of color across the country.Biden, who will hold a primary night event in Los Angeles, has polled well with older Latinos, though they make up a smaller share of the electorate. Meanwhile, Bloomberg, who has poured hundreds of millions of dollars of his own fortune into the Super Tuesday states, has also been targeting Latinos with Spanish-language ads and mailers.Strong performances with Latinos in California, Texas and Colorado could prove decisive on Tuesday and propel Sanders into the next series of contests, which includes Arizona and Florida.In California, the campaign has 105 staff members and 23 field offices statewide, which Rafael Návar, Sanders’ California state director and a native of East LA, said are mostly in “heavily Latino” and “working class” neighborhoods.Sanders visited the state for the opening of a field office in Coachella, located in the same unit where the labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez organized on behalf of the United Farm Workers of America in the 1960s.“You had not had somebody running for president visit the city of Coachella since John F Kennedy,” Návar said.The endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year-old Latina congresswoman from New York, solidified Sanders’ standing among young Latinos in particular. At a rally together in Queens, she adorned him with the nickname Tío Bernie, an endearment that has resonated with Latinos who have come to see Sanders as their champion.“The story of our community is one of constant struggle in America, a struggle to be recognized, and to have full citizenship and full rights,” said Návar, a former labor organizer with the Communications Workers of America. “And so I think there’s a real connection because he’s seen as someone who has always been fighting against overwhelming odds.”Many young Latino supporters say they are drawn to his promise of Medicare for All and free college tuition. But another major part of his appeal is his ambitious immigration platform. Sanders has also taken some of the most liberal stances on immigration of any Democrat, policies that Latino staff, including some undocumented members of the campaign, helped to shape.“Latinos are going to the polls with the economy and healthcare in their minds and immigration in their hearts,” Clarissa Martinez de Castro, deputy vice-president of UnidosUS, the largest Latino civil rights and advocacy group in the country.Sanders has vowed to reverse all of Trump’s executive actions on immigration on “day one”, including ending his “zero-tolerance” policies and restoring the Daca program for young undocumented people Trump’s administration cancelled. He has also promised to place a moratorium on deportations until further review, end raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and pass comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for some of the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US.Even Sanders critics agree his outreach has been impressive. Luis Alvarado, a Los Angeles-based Republican consultant who specializes in Latino voter outreach, praised Rocha’s approach but remains skeptical that Sanders can replicate his early state success.“Nevada Latinos are mostly blue-collar, worker-class with a family tie to a union,” he said. “Because of that, the messaging of being a Democrat socialist resonates. I don’t see that same formula applying to Latinos in a state like California and Texas.”Compared with Nevada, Alvarado said there is a broader range of economic and educational attainment among California’s Latino electorate. And Texas Latinos are traditionally more conservative than Latinos in California and Nevada. In 2018, four in 10 Hiics voted for Texas’s Republican governor, even as Latino turnout in the state drove the “blue wave” that helped Democrats regain the House majority.The Sanders campaign is also courting Latinos in North Carolina and Virginia, where a rally in Richmond last week drew more than a hundred activists from the local chapter of Casa in Action, an immigrant rights group that endorsed him.“We are leaving no stone unturned,” Rocha said.Yet Sanders’ recent praise for certain aspects of the Cuban revolution has alarmed Latinos in Florida, one of the most critical presidential battlegrounds. Democrats and the party quickly condemned the comments but say they fear the impact his nomination would have on the state’s down-ballot candidates.“Revolución and camarada are not words that should be used in Florida,” said Evelyn Perez-Verdia, a Florida-based Latino issues strategist who is Colombian American.She said his praise of socialist governments in Latin America risks alienating not only Cuban Americans, many of whom are Republicans, but also Venezuelans, Colombians and Nicaraguans. Among Latinos in Florida, Sanders polls notably behind Biden and Bloomberg.The campaign does not view Sanders’ remarks as problematic, ascribing the backlash to members of “the Democratic establishment and Republicans who never liked Bernie anyway”, Rocha said. The campaign has announced ad buys in Florida and has already deployed staff to the state, where they are targeting younger progressives who have no memory of the cold war.“The people we are talking to on the ground there love him,” Rocha said.Two days before Super Tuesday, the most consequential voting day of the presidential primary, more than 15,000 people poured into a convention hall for a Sanders rally in downtown Los Angeles. Outside sellers hawked “Tío Bernie” T-shirts as street vendors pushed carts that sizzled with bacon-wrapped hotdogs.Speaking at the rally, Marisa Franco, co-founder of Mijente, a Latinx activist organization, said the complexion of the crowd on Sunday night showed that Sanders’s support among Latinos was “undeniable”.And why is a 78-year-old senator from one of the whitest states in the country resonating with Latinos, whose median age is 29?“Real easy,” she said. “Because he’s working for it. Because his platform speaks to our people and because of the concept of palabras” – the consistency of his message.The senator stepped on stage, and, admiring the size of the crowd, boasted that the establishment was getting “very nervous”.But there was nothing to fear, he assured them. His political philosophy was simple: “My family cares for your family. Your family cares for my family. We grow together.”Among those in the crowd was Alonzo Ugalde, the volunteer who spent the afternoon canvassing for Sanders in East LA. By the time polls close on Tuesday, he estimates he will have knocked on 2,500 doors since he began volunteering with the campaign in April 2019.“I wondered if I ever would have been willing to go and knock on somebody’s door and ask them for their vote if it wasn’t for Bernie Sanders. I probably wouldn’t have,” he said. “If I run for office one day, that will be because of Bernie Sanders.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7504b65a5fde3c9dc292c75ff64199818a1644de/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2314e0ea032f99be86d6b54253a1780f","title":"britain is leaving europe the guardian is not","story":"The editor-in-chief explains why the  is deepening its commitment to European voices, issues and peopleToday we are making a renewed and deeper commitment to reporting on every aspect of Europe – the continent, its people, its politics, institutions, economy and culture. is a European news organisation with a close relationship with our large and committed audience in Europe.

These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. The publication of the research comes five weeks after Britain became the first country to voluntarily withdraw from the EU, and it coincides with a  editorial commitment to deepen its coverage of Europe.After more or less flatlining for more than a decade, support for Euroscepticism - which began to emerge as a fringe electoral theme for European far-right parties after the 1992 Maastricht treaty – started climbing rapidly from 2005.Rooduijn attributes this rise mostly to the sharp Eurosceptic turn taken by Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, which sees itself as a “Christian bulwark”. He notes a similar big increase in 2010 when Hungary’s Fidesz – “the future of Europe”, according to its leader, Viktor Orbán – fully embraced Euroscepticism.A third jump in support, this time among “other Eurosceptics”, came in 2013, reflecting the emergence of the Five Star Movement (M5S) in Italy. Far-right and far-left Euroscepticism made further gains in 2015 with the growing popularity of Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and Podemos in Spain.Rooduijn suggested these four distinct waves of increasing Eurosceptic electoral success may additionally be related to the EU’s eastward expansion in 2004 and the 2005 French and Dutch referendums on the proposed EU constitution the Eurozone crisis of 2010 and the migration crisis of 2015 and the 2016 Brexit referendum.“This new data shows that the rise of these parties’ electoral successes is steeper than previously thought,” Rooduijn said. “It’s striking because it means that today more than one in every three Europeans votes for a party that is critical of the EU.”The success of Eurosceptic parties, however, “is only partly due to their actual Euroscepticism”, Rooduijn said. “For almost all of them, the issue of European unification is only of secondary – or even tertiary – importance. Their electoral successes are primarily due to their positions on other issues.”He cited the example of Eurosceptic far-right parties, which make up about half of all the parties the project classifies as Eurosceptic. “These parties focus first and foremost on the issue of immigration,” Rooduijn said. “So although the EU plays an important role for them and their voters too, it is not their core issue.”Multiple studies have shown that public opinion of the EU has, on average, become more positive in the last four years, apparently reflecting mounting uncertainties caused by the upheaval of Britain’s Brexit vote and the election in the US of Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his hostility towards the EU.At the same time, alarmed by the popular backlash against Brexit, European populist leaders such as France’s Marine Le Pen, Italy’s Matteo Salvini and the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders are no longer demanding Frexit , Italexit or Nexit.Instead, said Cas Mudde, a populism specialist at the University of Georgia in the US, while most of Europe’s populist radical right parties remain Eurosceptic, they now seek to “reform the EU into a looser, more democratic organisation that returns national sovereignty to member states – although they differ on the nature of the future Europe they want.”Yet despite the broad increase in public support for the EU in general, and the softer stance of many previously hardline Eurosceptic parties, the latest PopuList project data indicates that “when it comes to actual voting behaviour and parliamentary representation, Euroscepticism is still alive and kicking”, Rooduijn said.One reason is simply the increased salience of the EU as an issue, he said. “As a result of an accumulation of various EU-related events, such as Brexit and the eurozone and migration crises, focus on the EU has increased over the years. Moreover, it’s likely to remain high on the political agenda.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17720ed46880ec1b37cad4cdda4f34d341423b62/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a3e7c1b63ef008956e55366082ddd5f","title":"anne hidalgo paris mayor second term interview","story":"Terror, floods, heatwaves, protests and climate fights have not stopped the politician from standing for a second termWhen Anne Hidalgo was elected mayor of Paris in 2014 she thought she knew what running the French capital involved after a decade as first deputy.In the event, no amount of experience could have prepared her for what was to come.Before her first year in office was out, there had been terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo newspaper and the Hyper Cacher supermarket. Ten months later, the capital was devastated by a series of suicide bombings and shootings that left 131 dead, and Parisians shocked, grief-stricken and fearful.Her six years at City Hall have also seen two serious floods, several heatwaves – temperatures in Paris rose to a record 42.6 C last summer – 16 months of weekly Gilets Jaunes protests and, since December, demonstrations against the government’s pension reforms.“It’s not been a very easy time. We’ve had some terrible shocks and catastrophes, lots of events that could not have been foreseen: terrorism a massive influx of refugees and migrants and an acceleration of the climate emergency,” she says.“It’s not enough to want to be mayor of Paris because it’s fun or because you are running this magnificent city, you have to have broad and solid shoulders. It’s been like piloting a catamaran in an almost permanent force 7-9 wind for six years.”In her place, she says, some might have said “enough” but Madame la Maire as she is now called – previously the noun maire was always masculine, never mind the gender of the incumbent – is seeking a second term in office.“You have to ask, why do I want to be here, when I could be doing something a little easier? You have to work on your relationship with power … then you have to be methodical and rational, criticise, analyse before acting, understand, ask questions around you and of yourself, and once you have decided on a path, follow it. Otherwise, you are just a headless chicken,” she says.She is a technocrat who abhors populism and putting a celebrity spin on political life. She smiles a lot and is collegiate – her deputy mayors are loyal and she defers to them – but the smiles mask a steely determination.The core of Hidalgo’s first term in office has been tackling pollution and making Paris greener. Key is the idea of the 15-minute city, where residents can find most of what they need – shops, leisure facilities, education – on or near their doorstep. Her programme also includes planting thousands more trees to create mini urban forests, new parks, gardens and vegetable patches on roofs.“We have 10 years to act on the climate emergency. To act, not sit around for 10 years thinking and discussing how to act,” she says.One of her most controversial acts of the last six years has been to pedestrianise the main highway along the right bank of the Seine, turning it into a long narrow park for walkers, cyclists, musicians and cafes.Parisian taxi drivers and private car owners are among the fiercest critics of her crusade to discourage inidual vehicle use and tackle pollution by pedestrianising other swathes of the city centre, which has resembled a vast construction site at times.The motoring lobby says the subsequent build up of traffic has made air quality worse, but Hidalgo is unrepentant arguing her measures will eventually pay off. Under her guidance, the city council has already voted to ban diesel cars from 2024 and petrol cars from 2030.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. “We’ve given vehicle owners plenty of notice so they cannot complain they were not warned,” she says. “The place for the car in our city will be reduced even more with more alternative mobility available like bicycles, more buses and car sharing.”Hidalgo is a figure who inspires valedictions and vilification. Residents of the more chic arrondissements, generally south and west of the River Seine, dislike her calls for “solidarity”, an ideology in which not all social housing, migrants, homeless and drug addicts are pushed out to grittier districts to the north and east. She is an avowed enemy of Airbnb regarding it as a form of property speculation that robs the city’s rental market of much needed homes and wants to reduce the maximum number of rental nights to 30 a year.Keeping the middle and working classes living in the city is a challenge, but she says her 2016 pledge to increase social housing, introduce rent controls and encourage publicprivate investment in development is paying off.Cleaning the city is a delicate question, especially as Paris gears up to host the 2024 Olympics. “It’s true Paris is not clean enough,” she says. “We are currently paying €550m a year to keep the city clean, we have added rubbish bins, we have increased the number of cleaners and adapted their working hours to meet the need. And still it’s not enough. This means we have another, deeper problem, a collective subject, a question of education.”Spanish-born Hidalgo grew up on a housing estate near Lyon and became French in her teens. Her maternal grandfather, Antonio, fled General Franco’s fascist Spain in 1937, crossing the Pyrenees with his family on a donkey. He returned two years later and was jailed, his family in San Fernando near Cádiz outcast as “children of the reds”.“I rise early. I go to bed late. I have few weekends and even fewer holidays but I’m not complaining. This is a choice I have made, a choice accepted by my husband and family and not a simple one for them,” she says. “It’s particularly difficult for my children who obviously didn’t choose to have a mother who is famous and recognised and who is sometimes the object of attacks, like anyone in the public eye.”The mayoral job is often seen as a springboard to the Elysée Palace, but Hidalgo insists – as she has done every time she has been asked over the last six years – she has no intention of standing for president.“My job is to transform this extraordinary, magnificent city without damaging it. To make it a city agreeable to live in but one that is a model that that inspires, without denying its history,” she says.“It comes down to values. In a worrying, anxious-making, changing world, values are the only compass. When I’m not sure what to do, when I have low points, I refer back to my values, I ask myself: why do I want to do this or that, what is in the general interest? When you are mayor of Paris you have to think about more than yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67b8a4f4df8ee62c20b64d5952a590dc6b5becda/167_0_2050_1230/master/2050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58b43a5f4c44b6078e830b33db93fdb","title":"battling coronavirus misinformation in the age of social media","story":"Myths and falsehoods spreading quicker than officials can provide updates Public health professionals trying to provide the nation with facts about the spread of coronavirus are battling a wave of misinformation, as they wrestle with the first major British health crisis of the smartphone era.Officials are providing regular updates to the media on the spread of the infection, but at the same time half-truths about the best way to treat the illness are already going viral on WhatsApp and other messaging services.Some are suggesting dubious herbal remedies, while one viral message – which claims to be advice from an uncle who is a Chinese doctor – mixes standard best practice with unverified claims about how best to kill the germs.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.While the inherently private nature of WhatsApp makes it hard to track the spread of such material or judge how many people are reading it, some of the posts seen by the  use the standard language of internet chain letters and urge people to forward the advice to friends and family – circumventing the official health communications in the same manner that has allowed anti-vaccination movements to flourish online.Prof David Harper, a former chief scientist at the Department of Health, said the UK’s established communications strategy for a public health crisis is to have a trusted medical figure rather than a politician deliver regular updates to the public.He said this approach worked well during the 2009 influenza pandemic: “It was decided early on that the designated person would be very visible even if there was very little to say. If no one is saying anything then it becomes a cause of concern. It’s much better to be visible and be seen by the public, even if it’s just to repeat what’s been said or say there’s not been much change.”It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to\u0026nbspmore than 60 other countries. The worst affected include South Korea with nearly 5,000 cases, and Iran, with over 1,500 cases.There have been\u0026nbsp40 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.Harper, now a fellow at Chatham House, said there is some risk that people become “desensitised” if they are provided with too much information on how many people have been infected without sufficient context, but that transparency improved public trust.A decade on this approach is being challenged by the radically changed media environment. Major social networks, aware of past criticism of their role in spreading untruths and hysteria over health issues, have moved to get ahead of the problem and are actively engaging with the UK government to provide information.Both Facebook and Twitter are promoting official NHS guidance, providing links to NHS advice in users’ feeds and when they search for coronavirus-related terms. Google, often the first port of call for health advice, is promoting official advice.The BBC, having spent recent months being attacked and stonewalled by the government, is emphasising its role in disseminating accurate, timely information about public health issues, with a spokesperson pushing the fact its coverage reaches millions of Britons with official guidance.“We know the public turns to the BBC at times like this,” said a spokesperson, pointing out that nine of the corporation’s 10 most-read stories online during the past week were about the virus. Also highlighted was the decision to make a special public information programme on the outbreak on Monday night.For a government that has put great weight on bypassing traditional media outlets, the outbreak has forced it to reconsider its relationship with the broadcaster. On Saturday a government minister was heard giving an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme for the first time since the general election, breaking a No 10-imposed boycott to deliver an update to the programmes’s millions of listeners. And on Tuesday health secretary Matt Hancock appeared on the same programme ahead of the publication of the government’s so-called ‘battleplan’ to combat the spread of the virus.Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said he still believed the government’s communications efforts were insufficient, and had been damaged by political boycotts of Today and ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “You are reliant on communications in these situations, and need every media outlet necessary. You certainly shouldn’t be boycotting programmes, frankly that’s pretty feeble,” he said.Kerslake added that not enough ministers had appeared in the media to support Hancock, who has been leading communications efforts on coronavirus almost single-handedly in the past few days. “No criticism of Hancock, but if I was him, I’d want a bit more back-up.”Harper, the former Whitehall official, accepted that Boris Johnson’s decision to call a meeting of the emergency planning committee Cobra may be partly for media consumption. But he said it also helps reassure the public about the seriousness of the issue: “In this case, the prime minister is seen to be in control. It is important that the machinery and the accountability for taking the decisions are seen. We have to be careful not to be too hung up on who’s doing what at what point.”Additional reporting by Elle Hunt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a4c2a254e675a9e97e37421077db7a8eee4cf5/0_135_4062_2437/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4516e3f7d5f900c0711a4e84d41683c3","title":"elbow bumps and footshakes the new coronavirus etiquette","story":"Virus means handshakes, cheek-kisses, hugs may not be welcomeWhen the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, extended her hand to her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, at a meeting on Monday, he refused her handshake and waved her away.Pre-coronavirus, his gesture would have been the epitome of bad manners. But, with 150 cases now confirmed in Germany, a smiling Merkel immediately held up her hands and said: “That was the right thing to do.”Coronavirus is changing social interaction, especially in the western world. Handshakes, cheek-kisses, hugs – the everyday greetings ingrained in our culture – are not as welcome as they used to be.In Italy, Angelo Borrelli, the country’s special commissioner for coronavirus, has suggested that Italians’ demonstrative nature could be contributing to the virus’s spread, urging citizens to be “a bit less expansive”.Likewise in France, where the health minister, Olivier Véran, has advised people to cut back on hugs and kisses, though the French president, Emmanual Macron, was seen to double-cheek kiss the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, twice during a summit in Naples on Thursday.In the UK, Public Health England has not gone quite as far. When Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for PHE, arrived at Radio 4’s Today studios on Monday, presenter Mishal Husain asked if it was OK to shake hands, assuming he would say it was not.In the meantime, good hand hygiene is the key message.“Science says shaking hands is disgusting,” Nicky Milner, director of medical education at Anglia Ruskin university told the . She pointed to research showing on average we carry 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species on our hands. On average, we will shake hands 15,000 times in our life time, she said.A handshake transfers twice the amount of bacteria compared to the quicker fist-pump or high-five. “If you’re shaking hands, you tend to put your palms together and wrap your fingers around. Whereas, when you minimise the contact between the skin, you have a small surface area in which there are micro-organisms, so transfer fewer. It’s all probability,” she said.The Japanese bow, the Thai “way, where palms are pressed together in prayer-like fashion, are all healthier”, she added. “In Ethiopia, they touch your elbow, then you bang opposite shoulders.”Yet, she cannot see such greetings becoming commonplace here in the UK. “The challenge would be the cultural shift.”“In the UK, the handshake is formal. It’s professional. It’s used in meeting and greeting. It closes business. It’s such a powerful procedure that we perform. It’s not just about saying hello. So that brings us back to good hand hygiene.”The World Health Organization’s director of pandemic disease, Sylvie Brand, meanwhile, has endorsed the elbow bump, footshakes, waves and the “wai” as safer alternatives to shaking hands.Dr Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, researches how social behaviour and immunity shapes disease transmission. On reducing handshakes and kisses, he said: “Obviously all these things can reduce transmission, but there’s no one quick fix”.“If this becomes an outbreak, it’s not going to be a matter of people making one small change to their behaviour. It’s going to be series of changes across a number of aspects to their behaviour.” Awareness of and modifying interaction with vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, was crucial, he said.As more people begin changing their behaviour, church communities are among those taking precautions. Congregants with coughs and flu symptoms are advised to refrain from the “sign of peace”handshake, and to receive the communion host in their hands, rather than on their tongues.Many Catholic priests are already choosing to deliver the host this way for all parishioners, the church said. The sign of peace would be suspended in the event of confirmed coronavirus case in any congregation. Meanwhile the Church of England advice to those with cold and flu symptoms is to refrain from taking wine from the common cup.Social etiquette consultant Jo Bryant, believes the UK may have a slight advantage over its European nations, “because we are a non-tactile nation, and we do like our personal space”.“This is new territory for etiquette,” she said, advising people to “hang back a little”, before they go in for the big handshake.Her advice: Take time, hang back, look at how the other person is approaching the interaction as well, “and between the two of you, work it out”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a37e32fa81d911dcf15d20cb340c8e70fc64f41/0_125_3896_2338/master/3896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=466db9186c7bb1790245a56e2cc1af37","title":"eu member states call for 2030 climate target","story":"Dozen member states hope letter will focus minds before Glasgow UN talks this yearA dozen countries have called for an EU climate target for 2030 to be drawn up “as soon as possible”, if the bloc is to galvanise the rest of the world before vital UN talks in Glasgow later this year.In a letter to the EU’s top official on climate action, Frans Timmermans, the dozen EU member states say “the EU can lead by example and contribute to creating the international momentum needed for all parties to scale up their ambition” by adopting a 2030 EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction target “as soon as possible and by June 2020 at the latest”.This year’s UN talks in Glasgow are crucial, as the world is far adrift of goals set at the landmark 2015 Paris conference, including the aspiration to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Even half a degree higher will significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people.EU officials think a couple of months’ difference in proposing the target makes little difference, but would allow them to bring onboard more reluctant countries, including Poland, which has not yet signed up to the EU-wide goal of net zero emissions by mid-century.The climate and environment ministers argue timing is crucial, as they want the EU to have a 2030 target, before an EU-China summit in September and well ahead of Glasgow climate talks in November. “No other major economy is prepared to take the lead to ensure an ambitious implementation of the Paris agreement,” they write.Wendel Trio, the director of the Climate Action Network Europe, said: “By proposing a 2030 target increase only in September, the commission will give member states no time to reach an agreement by Cop26 in November, the international deadline by which all countries must commit to new, ambitious climate pledges for 2030. The EU needs to have its own house in order, and quickly to push other countries to make substantial contributions well before the deadline.”The letter, organised by Denmark, was also signed by France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. Only two signatories – Slovenia and Latvia – are central and eastern countries that joined the EU after 2004. Germany is conspicuous by its absence.The EU climate law is the centrepiece of the European Green Deal, which aims to transform Europe’s economy to confront the climate emergency. The law could set Brussels on a collision course with populist governments in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which have been the slowest moving on the climate emergency. Putting the 2050 net zero target into law means Poland could be outvoted if it continued to refuse to sign up.The European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy.The European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs money will have to be raised plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out.Under the law, Brussels would also be able to take a government lagging behind on its climate target to the European court of justice, which can issue daily fines for failure to uphold EU law.Climate activists have accused the commission of lacking ambition, as the climate law gives scant detail on how the EU will meet the 2050 net zero target, either by phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, reforming the EU’s common agricultural policy or regulating industry.“With no 2030 climate target and no measures to end subsidies for fossil fuels, industrial farming and other destructive industries, the commission has left a big hole in what’s meant to be the flagship of the European Green Deal,” said Sebastian Mang, a climate and energy policy adviser at Greenpeace.The Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is likely to give her verdict on the EU climate plans when she meets MEPs on Wednesday. She will also lead a “European strike” in Brussels on Friday with Belgian campaigners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304a92c01bc67e558a8bd28d6d5421fed7073a1c/0_195_5788_3473/master/5788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f172aeb558e0cb72292d032dc94ee4d","title":"explained uk coronavirus action plan","story":"What the government’s measures to fight the spread of Covid-19 mean in practicePublicity will be increased about the need for good hygiene measures (handwashing and “catch it, bin it, kill it”) and for workers to stay at home for the full duration of their illness.These include school closures, encouraging homeworking, and reducing the number of large-scale gatherings. It includes the caveat that the country should be able to continue “as normally as possible”.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.There is acknowledgement that the capability of the emergency services to operate may be impeded by increased spread of the virus. The document refers to a potential significant loss of officers and staff, which could force police to concentrate on serious crimes and maintaining public order.New powers introduced in England allow “medical professionals, public health professionals and the police to … detain and direct iniduals in quarantined areas at risk or suspected of having the virus”. Scotland already has such powers, while in Wales and Northern Ireland a justice of the peace can let officials “isolate, detain or require iniduals to undergo medical examination”.Under the plan, “health and social care services will work together to support early discharge from hospital, and to look after people in their own homes”.If the virus leaves more people ill enough to require hospital care and also NHS staff too sick to work, “clinicians may recommend a significantly different approach to admissions”, including delays to some non-urgent care, the plan says.The action plan recognises that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to an increase in the number of deaths, particularly among vulnerable and elderly groups, and that dealing with these additional fatalities could put pressure on local authorities.The plan confirms that, if necessary, “leavers and retirees” may be called back to work to help relieve pressure on current NHS staff.

Or at least that is how it appeared to some onlookers.The prime minister was clearly on a downward trajectory. After embarrassingly losing allies and failing to form a government after last April’s election, the 70-year-old rightwing leader suffered a humiliating result in a repeat vote in September.He managed to limp on by stymying his opponent, Benny Gantz, and forcing an unprecedented third election, but the situation deteriorated further: in November, Netanyahu was indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three major criminal cases. In December, he had to fend off an internal leadership challenge.Adding to his woes, the timing of Monday’s election – held just two weeks before a scheduled court appearance in Jerusalem – could not have been worse.Yet as the votes were being counted on Tuesday, it seemed Netanyahu, who denies all the charges, had somehow regained his swagger. While it remains unclear if he can form a government, or if the country is doomed to remain in political stasis, his ruling Likud party appears to be on track to win a significant number of seats and more than any other faction.Writing in the often pro-Netanyahu newspaper, Israel Hayom, commentator Mati Tuchfeld said the result was a comeback unseen in Israeli politics.He wrote: “Remember, this isn’t some shiny new candidate who managed to attract a large following, but the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history who has reinvented himself.”Blame may inevitably fall on his opponent, Gantz, who never truly differentiated himself ideologically. The former chief of the army largely agrees with Netanyahu on many of the key issues, including the continued occupation of the Palestinian territories and allying with other nationalist rulers such as Donald Trump.Instead, Gantz ran his campaign on notions of personal honesty and integrity. He hoped Israelis would see him as a clean-cut alternative to Netanyahu. But even if they did, it did not help him.That leaves perhaps two clear explanations for the result – voters either do not believe the corruption allegations, or they do not care. In this respect, there are parallels with some of Trump’s supporters in the US, who either refuse to believe or are happy to downplay criticism of his conduct.After midnight on Tuesday, at the ruling Likud party’s election event in Tel Aviv, the atmosphere was much more upbeat than the previous two rounds. Yuli Edelstein, the speaker of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, and Likud politician, walked confidently with a small entourage through the cheering crowds.Quickly asked about why the corruption cases appeared not to have had a bigger impact, he summed it up: “The people knew all the facts and figures, and this was their decision and their vote.”Earlier on election day, a grocer in Jerusalem, Ilana Benyamin, said the accusations of corruption did not phase her. She repeated a widely held local belief that Netanyahu’s 10-year run in power has made Israelis safer and richer, which she said was more important. “I don’t mind if he eats takeaway food in boxes covered with diamonds. Look at what is happening around us,” she said.As in previous campaigns, Netanyahu claimed only he could score big diplomatic wins from foreign leaders such as Trump, who agreed to long-taboo Israeli demands for permanent control of parts of the occupied territories. He also energised his hardline nationalist base by demonising citizens from Israel’s Arab minority and repeatedly promising future land grabs from Palestinians.So why didn’t Netanyahu also win in the last election? Campaign officials said the strategy this time was to turn a negative campaign – one in which the prime minister was warning of immediate demise – into a positive one.Rather than attempting to scare people into voting, which may have resigned them to a loss, Likud spread the message that victory was within their reach – if they turned out to vote.The campaign also found out that several tens of thousands of their supporters had not voted in the previous elections. They then went out to find them, one by one.Ravit Hecht, a columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, said Netanyahu had run a “venomous campaign” against Gantz by delving into his personal life. Vitally, she said, the leader persuaded voters that only he could end the painful political chaos by winning, even if it had a deeper cost for the country.“It’s worth mulling for a moment the choice that was made,” she wrote, “considering the admiration of Netanyahu’s cruelty, the worshipping of his dictatorial aggressiveness and the enthusiastic support for his campaign that included unbridled racism, lies, mudslinging and a descent into a moral abyss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a3455704a73f0c0e0801ae062a3d3215ffe5da/0_101_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4179a360e5ee07050384ee2ffc24e6c6","title":"indonesias most active volcano spews massive ash cloud 6000m into the air","story":"Eruption of Mount Merapi coated nearby communities with grey dust and forced an airport closureIndonesia’s most active volcano Mount Merapi erupted on Tuesday, shooting a massive ash cloud some 6,000m (20,000ft) in the air which coated nearby communities with grey dust and forced an airport closure.Ash mixed with sand rained down on towns as far as 10km (six miles) from the belching crater near Indonesia’s cultural capital Yogyakarta.“There was a thundering noise for at least five minutes and I could see the ash clouds from my house,” said Jarmaji, a resident of Boyolali regency.Authorities did not raise the volcano’s alert status, but they temporarily shuttered the international airport in Solo city – also known as Surakarta – some 40km away after the early morning eruption.Indonesia’s volcano agency warned residents to stay out of a 3km no-go zone around Mount Merapi, citing possible danger from flowing lava and pyroclastic flows – a fast-moving mixture of hot gas and volcanic material.Mount Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed more than 300 people and forced the evacuation of 280,000 residents.That was Merapi’s most powerful eruption since 1930, which killed around 1,300 people, while another explosion in 1994 claimed about 60 lives.The south-east Asian nation – an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and islets – has nearly 130 active volcanoes.It sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, a vast zone of geological instability where the collision of tectonic plates causes frequent quakes and major volcanic activity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646345a6ae038eab5ae9a8b880e099f11b29f99d/0_113_3137_1882/master/3137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73477e11683d28501f77a84fa0c0a19a","title":"israel election benjamin netanyahu claims early victory but remains short of majority","story":"Prime minister set for comeback despite upcoming criminal corruption trialBenjamin Netanyahu has claimed victory in Israel’s third election within a year, even as the country looked set for further political deadlock after early counts suggested he was still short of securing a historic fifth term.Critically, he was just two seats shy of a 61-seat parliamentary majority and, if the final tally remains the same, would only be able to form a government in the coming weeks by enticing rival politicians to join him.Regardless, the result was a stunning turnaround for a man two weeks away from the start of a major criminal corruption trial. He is expected to appear in a Jerusalem court on 17 March on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three major cases.His main opponent, retired general Benny Gantz and his Blue and White party, took 32 seats, partial results showed.Meanwhile, politicians representing the country’s sizeable Arab minority appeared to be set for significant gains. The Joint List alliance have been calling for people to vote for them as a protest against Netanyahu’s racist campaigns. Early counts showed the party had up to 17 seats, making it the third largest party in the Knesset by a clear margin.In the early hours of Tuesday morning at a rowdy election party in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu told cheering crowds waving blue flags that his “victory” was sweeter than the first time he became prime minister in 1996 because it was harder.“We stood in front of strong forces. They told us we are going to lose, that it was the end of the Netanyahu era,” he said. “We turned lemons into lemonade.”Responding to the results, Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy to the UK, said Israeli voters had “rewarded hate, corruption and the promise to annex the occupied territories”, referring to Netanyahu’s recent promises to take more Palestinian land.Gantz had focused his campaign on Netanyahu’s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves. The strategy appears to have failed three times.At the Blue and White election party, the room soon emptied as rumours started to spread of a potentially disastrous result. “We are not beating around the bush and not telling ourselves stories: I share the sense of pain and of disappointment,” Gantz said.Authorities had even set up separate polling stations made of plastic sheeting for the more than 5,500 Israelis who were under precautionary home isolation after returning from areas of the world affected by coronavirus.Israel has been in an extended state of political crisis for almost 12 months after two previous general elections failed to produce a clear winner. To break the deadlock, Netanyahu had sought to energise his hardline nationalist base with promises of land grabs from Palestinians.A week ago, he announced he would go ahead with a highly controversial plan to build settlements east of Jerusalem. The plan would almost completely encircle Palestinian neighbourhoods in the holy city.Netanyahu made similar appeals before the previous votes. In April, he said he would annex all current settlements, and in September he promised to go further, by claiming sovereignty over a third of the entire West Bank.He has also looked to his rightwing global ally, Donald Trump, to help him convince Israelis that he is the only leader able to garner concessions from world powers.In late January, the US president appeared to give Netanyahu just that, revealing a “vision for peace” plan in the White House that read like a checklist of demands from the Israeli far right. The Palestinian leadership rejected the plan as flagrantly biased.For Netanyahu, days or weeks of deal-making are now expected. If he fails, a fourth election could be called.Israel’s left-leaning Zionist parties, including the once dominant Labour, who have largely lost support during the three elections.Fearing it might not garner enough votes to even pass the threshold to make it into the Knesset, Labour merged with the centrist Gesher party. It also made a deal with the the anti-occupation Meretz party, which was itself accused of watering down its message by allying with less progressive politicians. The three-party alliance appeared to win just seven seats on Monday.At a Jerusalem polling booth, Shoshi Feld, who works for a children’s theatre, said she would vote for the alliance, but felt despondent.“It’s the least worst option,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d6ca3b8fc6ac90bbd451510ac4be934108e461/0_41_4546_2728/master/4546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74441e53e907e5862d1fd73a5bff711b","title":"the longest holiday parents coping with coronavirus school closures in east asia","story":"In a bid to stem spread of the virus, schools in Hong Kong, China and Japan have been shut for weeks“It’s been a long holiday,” laughs Hong Kong insurance worker and mother, Sarah Wong.Wong and her two daughters, Chloe and Greeta, are at a co-working space in Jordan, Kowloon. Chloe has set her desk up like home, with an iPad, her own lamp, and an aromatherapy diffuser. The girls, aged 12 and eight, are listening to online lessons from their school which has been closed because of the coronavirus.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to\u0026nbspmore than 60 other countries. The worst affected include South Korea with nearly 5,000 cases, and Iran, with over 1,500 cases.There have been\u0026nbsp40 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.Across the world, governments are ordering or contemplating school closures in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. French officials closed about 120 schools in areas that have reported the largest numbers of infections, its education minister said on Tuesday.In some countries parents have already had their children at home for more than a month. Some have taken holidays or sent the kids overseas to relatives.Most Hong Kong schoolchildren never returned to school following the lunar new year holidays after the government announced and then extended closures to 20 April.“In the first few weeks it was a little bit troublesome, it messed up all our schedules – not only the kids but all of our daily routine and work schedules,” Wong says.But the start of online classes brought back routine and relieved the girls’ boredom, Wong says, and she’s lucky to have an employer who lets her work flexibly. Friends aren’t so fortunate and she says they are “panicked”.When the weather is nice, Wong takes the girls to the playground or the beach, but amid calls for people to practise social distancing, they’re missing their friends.On Hong Kong Island the age gap between Eiffel Chau’s children – kindergarten, grade one, and grade five – has made it difficult to manage all three.“The youngest one in kindergarten doesn’t have any online class,” Chau says.“I just need to keep her busy so she won’t disturb the other two kids. She has company, but she sees the parents at home so she expects the parents to do something with her.”Chau says he’s lucky that he’s permitted to work from home, as his wife is a teacher and is busy running online classes for her students.His advice to other parents facing the same situation is to take advantage of it. Hong Kong’s schooling is notoriously demanding, but Chau is using the extra time to teach his kids more responsibility for their home and chores, and to do more exercise.“At the same time it’s also a good opportunity for us to catch up with family relations,” he says. “We have nowhere to go, even on the weekend. We do board games, and card games, that’s something we can take this chance to do.”In China, millions of students have been home from school since mid-February. Schools have been ordered to provide online lessons, and primary classes are reportedly broadcast on public television.Officials have advised, and in some cases ordered, families to stay inside, making the absence of school even harder for restless children stuck at home. Online videos show families playing elaborate games.A flood of advice online ranges from creating strict daily schedules to follow, to videos with home science experiments and tips for activities. A notice in February from the Gulou district in Beijing advised parents to cherish the time: “The parent is the most important teacher in every child’s life,” it said.But discussion topics such as “what kind of life have parents been pressured into” and “school start date is postponed” have more than 400m views and thousands of comments.“ I just want to know when kindergarten starts,” one wrote.“The kids are so destructive and parents are going crazy. I hope the epidemic passes as soon as possible, so that these destructive little beasts can study.”Others complained about the difficulty of supervising their kids’ online classes and heavy workload. One said: “I am being tortured to death by these online classes. When will this end?”In Japan many working parents were horrified by the government’s weekend announcement requesting every primary, middle and high school in the country to close until the start of the new academic year in mid-April.The unprecedented shutdown, affecting almost 13 million pupils, has forced companies to rethink their rigid work practices, to allow working from home or shortening business hours.Working mothers complained that the shutdown would force them to take time off, given the shortage of daycare facilities and the scarcity of nannies and babysitters.“I was shocked by the news of the school closures, and thought, what should I do?” Kobayashi told Associated Press. “There was no explanation of how this is going to work.”Back in Kowloon, Wong looks at her girls studying at the table and smiles. “I really hope they can go back to school soon,” she says. “They keep saying ‘I want to go to school’, which is good because before they didn’t want to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/957c38b0b846e66415c44f181fc141f3db965fb9/728_1267_2447_1468/master/2447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1a69373ed791901cf1e15190e7ceaa9","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms covid 19 wuhan china","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and when should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to more than 60 other countries. The worst affected include South Korea with nearly 5,000 cases, and Iran, with over 1,500 cases.There have been 40 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190883.1583194625!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus new measures to combat spread in ireland to be announced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 are also likely to be announced following a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team, which will be considering fresh advice from the European Centre for Disease Control.

More than 400 students of the school started two weeks off on Monday after public health officials ordered it to shut to prevent the spread of the disease.Mr Harris described the decision, which has been widely criticised on social media, as proportionate and evidence-based. “It is our job to provide information that is in the public interest it is not our job to provide information the public is interested in. That is a different test.”The process of tracing contacts of the person has been completed and the school has been cleaned, public health officials said, adding that family members of students in the school are free to continue their daily routine as normal.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald confirmed in a video posted on Twitter that her children attend the affected school.Meanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs warned Irish citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran due to the spread of the coronavirus there, making it the second country, after China, to be subject to a travel warning from the department since the virus outbreak began.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4191451.1583241868!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state should cancel st patrick s day events over coronavirus expert says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHundreds of thousands of people attend St Patrick’s Day events in Ireland every year.

Photograph:  Derek FarrellPoolAFP via GettyThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have arrived in Dublin for the start of a three-day visit to Ireland.William and Kate flew to Dublin Airport on a commercial Aer Lingus flight and were greeted by a small group of dignitaries led by Britain’s Ambassador to Ireland Robin Barnett.The couple will visit the Garden of Remembrance later on Tuesday, following in the footsteps of Queen Elizabeth, who laid a wreath in 2011 at the memorial to those who died for Irish freedom over the centuries.In a statement before their arrival, the couple said they hoped the visit would “build on the theme of remembrance and reconciliation” which followed on from the queen’s visit.In 2011 the queen visited both the Garden of Remembrance in Parnell Square and the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge where she paid tribute to the Irish who died serving the British crown in two World Wars.Her grandson’s visit to the Garden of Remembrance is significant in that he will only be honouring those who fought against British rule.A source close to the visit said it was intended to show “respect” to the complexity of the relationship between Ireland and Britain.The source said the queen had made a deep impression by laying a wreath in the Garden of Remembrance and it was hoped that the Duke and Duchess would carry on that tradition.They would do so in the spirit of the British queen’s comment in 2011 at Dublin Castle that both countries should be “able to bow to the past, but not be bound by it”.It also follows on from Prince Charles’s visit to Mullaghmore in 2017 where he visited the site where his granduncle Lord Mountbatten was killed by the IRA in 1979.First visitIt is the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first visit to Ireland. The Cambridges said they hoped to build a “lasting friendship with the Irish people”.They added that they “will learn about local organisations working to support and empower young people and projects which provide opportunities to help them develop important life skills”.“Their Royal Highnesses will also hear more about Ireland’s conservation initiatives and efforts to protect its environment, with a particular focus on sustainable farming and marine conservation.“2020 will see Galway host the European Capital of Culture on behalf of Ireland – a showcase of events highlighting the richness and ersity of Irish culture, art and sport. During their time in Galway, The Duke and Duchess will have the opportunity to experience a taste of modern and traditional Irish culture for themselves.“Throughout the visit, Their Royal Highness will meet a broad range of people, including the President, the Taoiseach and senior political leaders, children and young people, and those working in the creative arts, business and charity sectors.”The atmosphere has changed since 2011 as Brexit has strained Anglo-Irish relationships and the recent controversy over the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) reminded people of atrocities carried out by British forces in the War of Independence 100 years ago.Nevertheless, it is hoped that the visit will foster good relations between the two countries as Brexit negotiations begin.On Wednesday, the couple will pay courtesy visits to Áras an Uachtaráin to meet President Michael D Higgins.They last met the president during the commemorations that marked the centenary of the start of the first World War in June 1914.They will then visit Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Government Buildings before going to the Garden of Remembrance.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190769.1583186764!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"google staff in dublin told to stay at home after worker shows flu like symptoms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGoogle, which has 8,000 employees in Dublin, is also testing its wider preparedness by initiating a company-wide work from home day on Tuesday.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .President Michael D. Higgins has warned that the capacity of universities to provide a “moral space” for discussion is being eroded at a time of growing political populism.Mr Higgins, who was opening a celebration of Trinity College Dublin’s College Historical Debating Society, said “universities are not there merely to produce students who are useful”.“They are there to produce citizens who are respectful of the rights of others to participate and also to be able to participate fully, drawing on a wide range of scholarship,” he said on Monday night.The President said there is a growing cohort of people who are alienated and “who feel they have lost their attachment to society and decision making”.He explicitly targeted US president Donald Trump’s political sloganeering, saying these alienated voters “can become available for others who come and say to them ‘I want to be your voice’.”Mr Higgins said universities are relied upon “to create that moral space where people will be able to evaluate different suggestions”.Asked by his interviewer, the broadcaster and historian John Bowman, if he feared that capacity was being eroded, the President said “I do, straight up”.“We have a fractured society and the university is the place to where you would go for putting things back together in relation to discursive options,” he told a crowd assembled in Trinity’s Examinations Hall.He said universities and academics had become overly focused on the market, because of a sense that there was “magic happening in the marketplace… when in fact actually what you had was a whole series of vulgar chancers”.The College Historical Society, or “the Hist”, claims to be the world’s oldest undergraduate society and is running a week-long series of events to mark its 250th anniversary.Recalling his debating days in university, the President said debating is “a life-changing experience, most people who have done it will remember the very first time they debated and the sensation it caused”.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4191522.1583244113!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government formation talks likely to continue until easter says shortall","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSocial Democrat TDs and co-leaders Róisín Shortall (left) and Catherine Murphy.

But the EU holds that easy access to its single market can come only with close alignment to its rules and standards, as otherwise UK companies would have an unfair advantage over those of the EU – something that London has ruled out.Other sticking points include fishing rights: an economically puny but politically weighty issue, particularly for countries such as Denmark and France. Britain wants to preserve more of the catch in its territorial waters for its own fishing industry, ending the practice of shared fishing waters, but it relies on EU markets to sell much of its fish.The first round of talks will conclude on Thursday with a meeting of all groups and a bilateral meeting between Barnier and Frost, at which they will take stock of progress made so far.Britain has left the EU and is now in a transitional arrangement, continuing to observe the same norms as before until the end of this year. If no deal can be reached, Britain will begin automatically trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation default terms in January.Brinkmanship politics?Both sides have said they are willing to walk away without a deal, even though this would entail economic damage, particularly for Britain and its closest neighbours including Ireland. Britain has said it will prepare for a no-deal scenario if it judges that insufficient progress has been made by June.But whether or not a deal is struck, Britain has made clear that its ambitions are for a more distant relationship with the EU, even if that comes at an economic price.EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has urged companies to prepare for this by reactivating no-deal Brexit contingency plans.“I am very concerned that there’s not sufficient planning in place presently,” said Hogan. “The last thing we want to see is a logistical nightmare for our exporters at our ports and airports through not being properly prepared.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Eric BaradatAFP via Getty ImagesSuper Tuesday is the most important day in the Democratic primary calendar as the party’s presidential hopefuls vie for the chance to take on Donald Trump in November’s election.Following Joe Biden’s decisive victory in Saturday’s South Carolina primary, and the subsequent withdrawal from the race of Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer, Super Tuesday is shaping up to be a close contest between Biden and current frontrunner Bernie Sanders. It is also a pivotal day for Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, who will appear on ballots for the first time, having skipped earlier contests.The Super Tuesday results will help dictate the likelihood of a contested convention – a potentially combustible scenario in which no candidate receives a majority of delegates before voting formally begins in July.What is Super Tuesday?Voters will choose their preferred Democratic candidates in 15 contests that will elect 1,344 delegates to the Democratic convention, more than a third of the slightly less than 4,000 total. The elections will include the two most populous states, California and Texas, which have 415 and 228 delegates, respectively.The four states that have held their primaries or caucuses so far – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – together account for just 155 delegates, or less than 4 per cent of the total.Super Tuesday has historically narrowed the field of candidates. Those who fail to win delegates in key states will probably have trouble fundraising or qualifying for future debates.Who can vote?Eligibility to vote in Democratic primaries varies from state to state. In California and North Carolina, registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters are able to cast a ballot for one of the Democratic presidential contenders – but registered Republicans cannot. Maine holds closed primaries, meaning only registered Democrats can vote.Texas has open primaries, meaning all voters can vote in the Democratic primary regardless of party registration. South Carolina’s open primary system drew attention when some conservative activists in South Carolina urged Republicans to vote for Sanders in Saturday’s primary in a move they dubbed “operation chaos”.How are delegates allocated?Even if candidates do not win the state, they can still rack up delegates. Unlike the winner-take-all approach of the general election in November, the Democratic primaries and caucuses allocate delegates on a proportional basis.Each state’s total number of delegates is determined by a formula that takes into account its population and its support for Democratic candidates in the last three presidential elections.About two-thirds of the delegates in each state are allocated to candidates based on the statewide vote share – and only candidates gaining at least 15 per cent of the statewide vote are entitled to a share of delegates. Candidates with local pockets of support can also gain delegates if they have at least a 15 per cent share of the vote within a congressional district.There are also “unpledged” delegates, also known as “superdelegates”, who are free to support any candidate they choose. In the 2016 election, superdelegates became controversial because their commitments effectively secured Hillary Clinton’s nomination over Sanders. Since then, the voting powers of such delegates have been significantly reduced. They will only come into play in the event of a contested convention.What is likely to happen?Super Tuesday looks likely to establish Sanders and Biden as the frontrunners, according to polling data compiled by RealClearPolitics.In California, the largest state holding its primary on Tuesday, Sanders holds a double-digit lead over Biden. However, both Biden and Elizabeth Warren are also polling over 15 per cent in California, so even if Sanders wins California his main rivals may also end up collect some delegates there.Sanders is also the frontrunner in Texas, the second-largest state holding its primary on Super Tuesday. Polls there suggest Sanders is in a much closer four-way contest with Biden, Bloomberg and Warren.Polling data is more limited in other Super Tuesday states, but Biden currently has about a 2 point lead over Sanders in North Carolina. Sanders leads by a double-digit margin in Virginia over Biden, and over Warren in Colorado and Utah.It was unclear how Biden’s resounding victory in South Carolina and ensuing endorsements from party members and former rivals would impact the final outcome.Several candidates will be looking to capitalise on a home state advantage. Sanders looks likely to win his home state of Vermont by a wide margin. Warren is facing a tough challenge from Sanders in her home state of Massachusetts.What about Mike Bloomberg?Super Tuesday will mark the first test for Bloomberg, who skipped the contests in the four traditionally important, but relatively small, states that voted in February.Instead, he has opted to spend lavishly on broadcast and social media advertising in states voting on or after Super Tuesday, prompting other candidates and their supporters to accuse him of trying to buy the election.He is currently polling at 15 per cent in California, only just breaching the statewide threshold for gaining delegate votes, though he may stand to get a larger number of delegates allocated based on the vote shares in the state’s 53 congressional districts.What happens to delegates if candidates drop out?It depends. Pledged delegates at the district level will become free agents if their pledged candidate withdraws.Although they can theoretically vote for whomever they choose, if their candidate endorses one of the remaining Democrats before the convention, it is likely that candidate’s delegates would follow suit.Statewide delegates are more complicated. Although the results of state primaries determine how many delegates each candidate gets, the delegates themselves – the people who cast their ballot at the convention in July – are not chosen until a later date, according to political scientist Josh Putnam, who runs the blog FrontloadingHQ and keeps a calendar of delegate selection dates.If a candidate drops out before statewide delegates have been selected, those delegates will be reallocated to the remaining candidates in that state who have topped 15 per cent of the vote. Otherwise, those delegates will be free to switch their vote to the candidate of their choice.There is also a difference between suspending one’s campaign and formally withdrawing, says Putnam. Buttigieg, for example, can hold on to his eight statewide delegates as long as his campaign remains suspended. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: UK confirms 12 new cases, taking total to 51Boris Johnson will \u0026#39almost certainly\u0026#39 take paternity leave when his baby arrives Super Tuesday 2020: live voting updates as Joe Biden seeks edge on Bernie SandersPolitics latest news: Army on standby and police forced to focus on serious crime under coronavirus \u0026#39battle plan\u0026#39Row erupts over whether wartime pope tried to save Jews as Vatican opens up historic archives\u0026#39Cocooned in the artificial world of football\u0026#39: Jordon Ibe \u0026#39ignorant of his duties\u0026#39 after crashing BentleyComment: Hardened negotiators need a tougher breakfast than mere espresso and biscottiComment: The migrant crisis is exposing deep flaws in the EU projectWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Super Tuesday 2020: what time are the results announced, which states vote and why is it so important?China accuses Washington of ‘Cold War mentality’ after clampdown on US offices of its state-run mediaEU diplomats head to Turkey as smugglers slash prices for refugees trying to cross to Greek islands Comment: These trade talks will revolutionise our relationship with our American allies\tPutin suggests enshrining God and heterosexual marriage in Russia\u0026#39s constitutionHoli Festival 2020: how the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationUS election primaries, caucuses and debates: key 2020 dates for the Democratic raceUS Democratic race: how it works and what it means for the 2020 Presidential electionWho is winning the battle for delegates in the US Election 2020 Democratic primary race?How does coronavirus compare to flu, Sars, and other diseases?Government\u0026#39s coronavirus battle plan: Army on standby and police told to stop investigating lower-level crimePope Francis \u0026#39tests negative\u0026#39 for coronavirus after suffering heavy coldWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bernie sanders says california holds key democrat presidential","story":"Bernie Sanders has said whoever wins the California primary has an “exceptional” chance of becoming the Democratic presidential nomination at a raucous rally in front of more than 10,000 supporters in Los Angeles.The Vermont senator and democratic socialist called on high profile supporters from Hollywood and the music industry to help gee up his backers just 48 hours before the state, and 13 others, go to the polls.Members of the rap group Public Enemy bear-hugged Mr Sanders on stage before urging the crowd to raise a fist as they sung “Fight the Power”, a message that the Sanders campaign adopted for the night.Actor Dick Van Dyke, the 94-year-old star of Mary Poppins, made fun of concerns about Mr Sanders’s age, joking that he probably “got married or something” on the day the 78-year-old politician was born. Comedian Sarah Silverman mocked critics of the senator’s policies from the stage, saying at one point: “Free education and healthcare for all. What an a*******. Can you believe the nerve of this guy?”The crowds who had packed into the Los Angeles Convention Center responded with chants of “Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!” or waving blue and white placards that declared “Bernie - solidarity forever”. Of all the 14 states to vote on Super Tuesday, California has the most delegates up for grabs - the metric that will ultimately determine the winner of the race to take on Donald Trump at November’s election. Mr Sanders is more than 10 points ahead of any other challenger in the state in the polls, meaning he can claim the bulk of the 415 delegates up for grabs. The candidate who reaches 1,191 delegates will win the nomination. “We’re in it together. My family cares for your family, your family cares for my family. We’re in it together,” Mr Sanders told the room, playing up his ‘we not me’ campaign slogan. “But we not me means we must develop the strongest grassroots political movement in the history of this country.”Addressing the significance of the state in the race, Mr Sanders said: “The candidate who wins in California has an exceptional chance to win the Democratic nomination.”He knows from firsthand experience, losing California to Hillary Clinton in 2016. She went on to be the party’s presidential nominee before losing to Mr Trump. Mr Sanders ran through the familiar policies which have thrust him into front-runner status in the race - government-funded healthcare for all Americans, a $15 minimum wage, scrapping tuition fees, making marijuana legal. “This campaign is a campaign that is prepared to tell the truth about what goes on in our country, not push it under the rug. And that means we will end a broken and racist criminal justice system,” he said. Ms Silverman was the first celebrity to take to the stage for Mr Sanders. She praised his record of being a politician who “fights for equality not just for his people but for all people.”Van Dyke said: “He’s never been a career politician. He was just a patriot who worked as hard as he could.”He predicted that people who had stayed away from Mr Sanders in 2016 are now ready to vote for him after seeing Mr Trump unexpectedly win the presidency.The night ended with Chuck D, the American rapper who made up part of the group Public Enemy, telling the crowd to get to the polls on Tuesday. “Put some grown-up pants on. It’s no time to be on the couch,” he said, while trumpeting Mr Sanders’s determination to improve the US healthcare system and tackle climate change. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bloomberg makes last stand texas super tuesday","story":"Michael Bloomberg chose to deliver his Super Tuesday rallying cry near the Alamo, the fort where Texan revolutionaries were wiped out by a Mexican army in 1836. There could have been no more fitting spot for a final stand.The billionaire has already given up on winning California, the largest US state. But in Texas, the second biggest, he still has a fighting chance.We really need Texas to get the job done. The road to victory starts right here, right now, he told supporters in an old air force hangar in San Antonio. You\u0027ve all heard the slogan: \u0027Mike will get it done.\u0027 If you haven\u0027t … I’ve wasted an awful lot of money. Mr Bloomberg, 78, the world\u0027s ninth richest man, targeted Texas from the start of his unorthodox campaign (see video below), visiting seven times and carpet-bombing the state\u0027s airwaves. Appearing on stage to U2\u0027s Beautiful Day, he refrained from attacking, or even naming, any of his Democrat rivals, focusing instead on US President Donald Trump.He said: We have a leadership vacuum in the White House. There is a really serious crisis facing our country, and our world, and that is the coronavirus. President Trump buried his head in the sand.This is not a job for an amateur, and he is. Trump\u0027s incompetence really puts us at risk. He\u0027s the definition of ‘all hat and no cattle’. I\u0027m all action and no BS.The former New York mayor went on to describe himself as the un-Trump and vowed to send Donald back to Mar-a-Lago permanently.Addressing his own widely criticised debate performances, Mr Bloomberg said: You could see in the debates I\u0027m not someone who just yells slogans when they\u0027re not true. We need a leader ready to be commander-in-chief, not college-debater-in-chief. I believe we need less talk, less ision, less tweeting. How about no tweeting from the Oval Office ever again?In Texas, it is impossible to turn on a TV without seeing Mr Bloomberg. Some 80 per cent of presidential campaign advertisements are his. Across large swathes of the Lone Star State, he is the only candidate on air.One Spanish-language advertisement, repeated endlessly, cost $4.3 million. It says Mr Bloomberg has la fuerza para enfrentar a Trump - the strength to face Trump. A third of Texas voters are Hiic.The resulting poll numbers have been reasonably encouraging for Mr Bloomberg, placing him in an effective tie for second place with Joe Biden but trailing Bernie Sanders. However, experts say those numbers could be soft - meaning people like what they see in the advertisements but won\u0027t get round to voting.Mr Bloomberg\u0027s campaign points out that he also has by far the biggest ground game in Texas, with 19 field offices and 180 staff, many more than Mr Sanders. The candidate says he has also eaten a lot of Texas brisket while meeting voters.But when it comes to drawing crowds, there is no comparison with Mr Sanders, who previously barnstormed the state, including packing out a rodeo arena.By contrast, barely a few hundred people turned up at to see Mr Bloomberg. It was less than the number that tried to defend the Alamo.But I\u0027m still putting all my eggs in one basket because I believe this guy can beat Trump. I like Bernie and Biden, but we need to go with someone who has a chance.Mike Mullen, 72, a Vietnam veteran, said: I used to be a Republican but Trump\u0027s ruining the country. I came here to take a look, and Mike\u0027s got my vote. He’ll do better than people think.Mr Bloomberg\u0027s juggernaut of a campaign has been built by the very best data and advertising experts. His field organisers are being paid $6,000 a month, more than the average family income in Texas. He has spent an estimated $528 million on advertising alone.The top-down structure of the campaign is the opposite of Mr Sanders\u0027 organic movement.However, it appeals to those with a yearning, not for excitement and revolution but for competence and stability.In San Antonio, it was a serious, cerebral crowd. There were no baseball hats and, despite it being Texas, not a single Stetson. No one chants or dances wildly at a Bloomberg rally. If they feel the Bloom, they do so quietly.But they do go home satisfied that they have seen a man who knows what he is doing and what he is talking about.There was a similar reaction when Mr Bloomberg appeared last week at a Women for Mike rally in Virginia, where he is also polling well. The event was a response to allegations that he had made derogatory comments to women working at his media company, which he has denied.The middle-class audience, many dressed in “I Like Mike” T-shirts, snacked on chocolate croissants and fruit skewers in a hotel ballroom 10 miles from the White House.I think he actually is charismatic, but he\u0027s just not used to debating on TV, said Roberta Russell, 76, an author who brought along her champion poodle, Lexis Cathexus. He’s a fine man. He\u0027s highly educated and he’s reached a stage in life where all he wants to do is give. That\u0027s very admirable.Julianne Fanning, in her 50s and retired from working at the World Bank, volunteered to knock on doors. She said: We’ve lost credibility abroad. We need an honest broker in the White House.For Mr Bloomberg, the question is whether his appeal to voters\u0027 heads, rather than their hearts, can succeed. On Super Tuesday on March 3, where 14 states will cast their votes to nominate, he will find out whether competence and stability is enough of a draw.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"female director ftse 100 firm sacked 200k job did not discuss","story":"Talking about football has long been commonplace inside Britain\u0027s offices with opinions on the beautiful game a seemingly endless source of debate.But while sales director Adrienne Liebenberg watched on as her male colleagues bonded over their interest in the sport, she claims her apparent non-enthusiasm led to her being alienated and eventually dismissed.The businesswoman, who was paid £200,000-a-year by FTSE 100 firm DS Smith, an international packaging conglomerate based in London, has told an employment tribunal she was a victim of sexism.Ms Liebenberg joined the firm in March 2017 as its director of global sales and marketing but said she was soon marginalised because she didn’t partake in conversations about football or involve herself in office banter.She was dismissed from her role in December 2018 after being told that her leadership style was not working.Ms Liebenberg, who previously worked at oil and gas giant BP Castrol, has taken her former employers to an employment tribunal, arguing that she was sacked because of her gender.The company denies the accusation. In a statement read out at the tribunal, Ms Liebenberg claimed business decisions were often taken over boozy dinners with a gang of senior male employees, whose practice consisted of bonding, drink, and football.Ms Liebenberg added that she found it difficult to join in with these events, because she felt alienated by the focus on drinking, and talking about football, and starting up late.The tribunal heard tensions grew particularly between Ms Liebenberg and her line manager Stefano Rossi, the company\u0027s Packaging CEO.She told the tribunal: I felt that Stefano\u0027s modus operandi was to connect with his team over wine, dinner and football.Because I did not embrace those things in the way that my male colleagues did, I was perceived - by Stefano and others - as not being a \u0027team player\u0027 or \u0027one of the gang\u0027.Ms Liebenberg claimed Mr Rossi was a huge football fan, and would often interrupt meetings to discuss football or watch highlights.She added: I cannot remember a single day of meetings at which we went the whole day without Stefano watching football matches, or videos of parts of matches, on his phone or following football scores and interrupting meetings with an update or to discuss Inter Milan or a particular player.Expressing surprise at how male-dominated DS Smith was, Ms Liebenberg noted that she was often the only woman in the room.Out of 35 leadership roles in sales and operational positions at the company, only eight were reportedly filled by women Mr Rossi and his senior colleagues at DS Smith, some of whom, including CEO Miles Roberts, are respondents to the discrimination claim, are adamant that Ms Liebenberg was sacked because of poor performance rather than sexism.In a statement to the tribunal, Mr Rossi said Ms Liebenberg\u0027s dismissal was down to her dictatorial approach and lack of respect for senior colleagues. Mr Rossi added the company had sought a different leadership style following Ms Liebenberg\u0027s departure, and criticised the former director for not being collegial with other employees. The firm, Mr Rossi, Mr Roberts and HR director Tim Ellis all deny sex discrimination.

Just one is in England, and 11 are in Wales.The Government has promised communities will be given a “more effective voice” in making decisions on whether onshore wind farms can go ahead across the UK, but it will not change current planning regulations.The move was welcomed by environmental campaigners. Greenpeace said the announcement was “great news for anyone who pays an energy bill, and it\u0027s great news for our climate.”The plans announced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy yesterday will allow onshore wind and solar producers to bid for a long-term guaranteed price from next year.The price for offshore wind contracts last year reached a record low £40 per megawatt hour, cheaper than existing gas-fired power stations, and comparing to £92.50 per MWh from the planned Hinkley Point station.RenewableUK, an industry body, estimates that onshore wind could save households £50 a year on energy bills by 2035 and could provide 26,500 jobs in construction and maintenance.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/01/26/TELEMMGLPICT000151990653_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"rural britain nothing like singapore need farmers","story":"Worrying about food security may seem strange, but if global supply lines are disrupted we\u0026#39ll be grateful for home-grown harvestsIt wasn’t a good weekend for British farming. Leaked emails from Dr Tim Leunig, the economic advisor to the Chancellor, argued that, as agriculture accounts for a mere 1 per cent of the British economy, our farming industry is an unnecessary irrelevance. Instead, Dr Leunig suggested, we should follow the example of Singapore, which is “rich without having its own agricultural sector”.These comments are not only shocking and deflating for farmers, they are confirmation of what many of us have long suspected – that Westminster mandarins inhabit a very different world from the rest of us. Comparing Britain to Singapore? The latter is an economy based on finance, technology and knowledge, one of the most stable in the world, with high salaries and a completely different climate from Britain, not suited to food production. Is that seriously the sort of future we’re contemplating for the Peak District, the Lake District and active agriculture in Britain? I appreciate that sometimes in government it is useful to have people willing to explore unorthodox ideas, but that’s very different from spouting pie-in-the-sky nonsense. Taking a broader view of rural life shows just what would be lost. Living on a typical small family farm, as I do, there’s never a quiet day. Among the constant stream of callers might be the foot-trimming man, ready to do a vital job with livestock. The corn merchant will most days drop off a delivery. We’re quite likely to have the vet, either doing the mandatory TB check or coming to tend to unwell animals. The man with the straw visits several times in the winter, to make sure we can comfortably bed down  the cows. These are just some of the essential callers on which we rely – and all of their jobs depend on farming. You wonder whether Dr Leunig has any idea of their existence, let alone spent any time at all on a farm.Drive around your local area and you’ll almost certainly come across pubs offering a Sunday roast supplied by a named butcher and, often, a named farm. Nowadays we expect no less. We like to know we’re supporting the local economy and reducing food miles. Then you have the hospitality and tourism industries. What does Dr Leunig expect them to advertise and sell? Where do B\u0026ampB owners, landlords, chefs and serving staff fit into his statistics? Or do they not count at all?Most importantly of all, what happens in a farmerless Britain if basic food imports are disrupted? Used as we are to supermarket shelves loaded with exotic produce, it might seem strange to talk about food security. But you can’t follow the news without realising that we should not take current supply chains for granted. If you have an existing and trusted system, throwing it away merely makes you a hostage to fortune.Dr Leunig questioned the “poor me,” attitude of farmers, the special pleading, at the cost of restaurants and supermarkets. And perhaps farmers do need to listen more, not just throw their hands up in horror at what they perceive as the latest in a long line of attacks.Farmers do need to be more open, listen more and be more proactive in tackling countryside issues. But to question their existence is to attack the very soul of the land. What’s more, it’s hardly the way to win the trust of rural areas.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Everything you need to know about how the day worksPolls close between  7pm and 8pm local timeWhich candidates are left in the race?Joe Biden’s hopes of beating Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination received a boost after a string of moderate rivals dropped out just before today\u0027s ‘Super Tuesday’ vote. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, became the third centrist candidate to quit the race in as many days after deciding there was no path to victory, following former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and billionaire Tom Steyer.Ms Klobuchar and Mr Buttigieg appeared on stage with Mr Biden on Monday night to endorse the former US vice president.I\u0027m looking for a president who will draw out what is best in each of us, and I\u0027m encouraging everybody who was part of my campaign to join me because we have found that leader in vice president, soon-to-be-president, Joe Biden, Mr  Buttigieg told  a rally in Dallas.In an apparent swipe at Mr Sanders, the former mayor said: We have politics right now that makes it sound like being loudest is tantamount to being right. We need politics that\u0027s about decency.The clearing of the field helps Mr Biden, the former US vice president who is resurgent after a blowout win in South Carolina, as he fights to prove he is the best placed to beat Mr Sanders, a self-styled democratic socialist. Super Tuesday is the most consequential day of voting left in the race, with a third of all delegates - the metric that will determine the winner - up for grabs.Mike Bloomberg has spent more money on his campaign than any other presidential candidate in historyIt is also represents the first test for Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and billionaire, who has used his personal fortune to fund his candidacy. Mr Bloomberg entered the race less than three months ago and opted to skip the early voting states to focus his resources on Super Tuesday. It remains to be seen whether his unprecedented campaign spending will translate into electoral success when he appears on the ballot for the first time today. The two other candidates still in the race, Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, and Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman who has made little impact, are both also facing serious questions about viability. Rozina Sabur is reporting from Virginia, which has 99 delegates up for grabs, the fourth largest of any state voting on Super Tuesday. Given the state\u0027s mix of economic and social ersity, a candidate\u0027s success here will be a good litmus test for how the rest of the country will vote. Hillary Clinton narrowly carried the state against Donald Trump in 2016, but Virginia will be an important state to in determining the outcome of November\u0027s presidential election.The state\u0027s rural parts are deeply conservative but northern Virginia and university-educated women in the suburban areas contributed to the Republicans losing the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Today\u0027s primary is expected to be a two horse race between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, with the urban, university areas expected to support the progressive senator and the suburban parts more likely to vote in favour of the former Vice President.Mike Bloomberg has also been competitive in recent polls and he has spent a lot of his money and time in the state.  A poll of polls shows Mr Biden and Mr Sanders averaging 29 per cent and 24 per cent respectively, with Mr Bloomberg on 14 per cent. Which candidate wins in Virginia may offer a clue of what is to come. Polls close between 7 pm and 8 pm local time, depending on the state. However most of the Super Tuesday states have some form of widespread early voting. Voters in Minnesota, for example, could start casting ballots in January. Millions of postal ballot papers went out to California voters on Feb. 3, the day of the Iowa caucuses.Number of delegates available in each stateBernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg have had the widest and most aggressive footprint across the Super Tuesday states, largely because they\u0027ve got the money to spend. Mr Bloomberg is advertising in all 14 states, while  Mr Sanders is on the airwaves in 12. It\u0027s the first time Mr Bloomberg will be on ballots after he skipped the first four voting states, making the day a critical test of his theory that he\u0027s the best candidate to stand against Mr Sanders and, later, Donald Trump.Mr Sanders spent Sunday in California, holding rallies in the state\u0027s major liberal strongholds. He\u0027s hoping his monthslong focus on the state and resonance with Latino voters will help him win a large chunk of the state\u0027s 415 delegates. Joe Biden also plans to be in the state today. He hopes his strong showing in South Carolina is a harbinger of coming success with black voters, who dominate the Democratic electorate in a handful of Super Tuesday states. Meanwhile Elizabeth Warren may suffer the embarrassment of losing the primary in her home state of Massachusetts to Mr Sanders. While Super Tuesday won\u0027t necessarily determine who wins the nomination, it has historically been difficult for a candidate who performs poorly on the day to recover. Here\u0027s a look at Tuesday\u0027s contests. As well as California and Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Vermont, Utah, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Oklahoma are holding votes. The Super Tuesday states make up a erse range of voter groups. Most of the Southern states are Republican strongholds in the general election, while others like California are solidly Democratic. North Carolina is likely to be a battleground state in the general election.In California and Texas, white voters make up less than half the population. Hiics count for nearly 40 per cent of the populations in both states. California, meanwhile, has the nation\u0027s highest Asian population, at roughly 15 per cent. North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama and Arkansas have large populations of black voters, one of the Democratic Party\u0027s core voting blocs. The states blend a mix of urban and rural voters, as well as Democrats from all sides of the political spectrum. As candidates focus on wooing Southern Democrats in states like Texas and Arkansas, they must also be thinking about a message that can resonate in progressive San Francisco.Good afternoon and welcome to the \u0027s live blog. Our reporters will be bringing you the latest from across the country as 14 states and one US territory cast their votes in the Democratic nomination contest. Super Tuesday is when roughly a third of Democratic voters will cast their vote in the party\u0027s presidential nomination, making it one of the most significant points in the race to take on Donald Trump. This year has added significance because California, the state with the most delegates, will also have its say on the same day.A candidate needs 1,990 delegates to become the party\u0027s nominee. California has 415 delegates available, followed by Texas which has 228 and North Carolina which has 110. In all, there are 1,357 delegates available today.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The earth is slowly moving\u0026nbspMore trouble at the mill for Barclays.\u0026nbspAhead of the bank’s AGM, Jupiter Asset Management, one of its top 25 shareholders, has announced that it plans to back a shareholder resolution calling on the bank to phase out providing financial services such as lending to fossil fuel companies and utilities that fail to align with goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree Barclays bankers cleared of £4bn crisis deal with QatarBarclays should call time on golden hellos as it seeks a new CEO Jupiter is fairly middle of the road when it comes to UK fund managers.\u0026nbspIt’s not a corporate governance stick in the mud. It will use its voting power and take stances. But it’s not an ethical investment boutique and nor would you group it with, say, a Hermes, or one of the other more cutting edge institutional investors on the subject of climate change.It wasn’t one of the 11 big investors that signed up to the resolution at the outset, when campaigning group ShareAction was shaking the trees and looking for supporters, either.\u0026nbspIts decision to offer its support now is thus significant, all the more so because the resolution isn’t one of those wooly ones that call for more disclosure. It demands that Barclays takes concrete action to change its business.\u0026nbspThis could be seen as further evidence of the way the ground is shifting in the investment community.\u0026nbspFund managers are increasingly seeing climate change as a business risk, one that will hurt them\u0026nbspby wreaking economic damage and crimping returns. They are starting to\u0026nbsptake\u0026nbspit very seriously and are thus demanding that investee companies take it very seriously.Resolutions like this one rarely win, although sooner or later the dam\u0026nbspwill break.Even if it doesn’t this time, a significant vote in favour will still send a powerful message to Barclays’ board, which has come up with the usual guff about listening to shareholders in response to the move, and whomever is appointed to fill the roll of chief executive when Jes Staley departs.\u0026nbspBehind the scenes, the bank has quietly argued that it should be compared with a US, rather than a European peer group, because\u0026nbspit is a transatlantic investment bank.\u0026nbspThat won’t wash. It simply says, look, our peer group is ok with mucking up the planet so you should let us carry on too. Its a specious and short term argument.\u0026nbspThe bank also needs to wake up to the fact that while European money managers are ahead of the curve when it comes to the climate crisis, there have been tentative signs that American ones are belatedly starting to wake up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A reading below 50 indicates output is shrinking.With many companies and countries reliant on imports of goods from China, the slowdown will begin to impact supplies globally in the coming weeks and months.Its central or “base” scenario is that global economic growth will be 2.4 per cent this year, down from the 2.9 per cent it had forecast as recently as November. However, it also warns that the economic impact from coronavirus remains very uncertain and growth could fall much further, to 1.5 per cent this year.Much of this downward revision results from a slowdown in China where factories and cities have been shut down to contain the virus. Countries strongly interconnected with China, such as Japan, Australia and South Korea, will also experience economic damage, the OECD says.The organisation\u0026nbspthinks the most likely scenario is that the effects of the virus will fade relatively soon. If the countries most exposed to coronavirus take effective\u0026nbspaction to mitigate the impact of coronavirus, global growth could rebound to 3.4 per cent next year.The OECD says: “A longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak, spreading widely throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America, would weaken prospects considerably.”In this scenario, economies in Europe and North America will also experience significant economic fallout from the virus.Demand is likely to be significantly hit across much of the world for an extended period, with countries accounting for 70 per cent of global GDP likely to be affected.Other countries may not fully replicate\u0026nbspChina’s tough restrictions on movement, but\u0026nbspmany of the economic impacts are likely to be similar.\u0026nbspThis would\u0026nbspsignificantly damage\u0026nbspconfidence, causing heightened uncertainty, while\u0026nbspvoluntary\u0026nbsprestraints on travel and commercial and sporting events are all likely to depress spending.On Sunday, the UK health secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out shutting down cities if the virus spreads widely in the country.\u0026nbspMr Hancock\u0026nbspsaid he would not take anything “off the table at this stage” when asked about a\u0026nbspWuhan-style\u0026nbspquarantine\u0026nbspby BBC’s Andrew Marr.“There’s clearly a huge economic and social downside to that but we don’t take anything off the table at this stage because you’ve got to make sure that you have all of the tools available if that is what’s necessary,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The tests simulate a range of potential shocks, including\u0026nbspa dramatic economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong.

A day later, the number of people tested had disappeared, and the number of cases had nearly doubled.Presumed positive refers to\u0026nbspcases\u0026nbspwhere people have been shown to have the disease by state testing but not by the CDC. The CDC\u0027s website notes that states are now reporting those cases independently, and that their counts are more current.State officials have complained that the previous requirement that tests were carried out by the CDC in Atlanta was slowing down the official response to the virus. Experts have warned that the slow testing has made it difficult to get a full picture of the spread of the disease.Testing rules are now being relaxed to allow states to carry out their own diagnostics, which will then be confirmed by the CDC.Created with Sketch.

It urged governments to\u0026nbspstep in to support sectors most affected\u0026nbspsuch as travel and tourism, and the car and electronics industries.It also called for central banks to provide extra liquidity to banks so\u0026nbspthey can help businesses suffering immediate cashflow problems.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIf the epidemic spreads widely, the G20 economies should lead an internationally coordinated framework for health care support, combined with coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus to rebuild confidence, the OECD’s report said.Amid trade tensions and political uncertainty, Europe and Japan were already growing slowly before the new coronavirus began to spread.The prospect of a pandemic sparked a\u0026nbsprapid sell-off on\u0026nbspstock markets around the globe last week as investors weighed up the impact of factory shutdowns, cancelled flights and disruption to the supply of goods.The FTSE 100\u0026nbspregained some of the lost ground on Monday morning, trading 1 per cent up on Friday’s close.\u0026nbspMarkets will gain little comfort from the OECD’s report or from separate data showing a slump in Chinese manufacturing.Factory activity plunged in February at its fastest rate and to its lowest level on record as anti-virus controls brought some production lines to a standstill.A monthly purchasing managers’ index released by Caixin magazine fell to 40.3 from January’s 51.1. A reading below 50 indicates output is shrinking.With many companies and countries reliant on imports of goods from China, the slowdown will begin to impact supplies globally in the coming weeks and months.Its central or “base” scenario is that global economic growth will be 2.4 per cent this year, down from the 2.9 per cent it had forecast as recently as November. However, it also warns that the economic impact from coronavirus remains very uncertain and growth could fall much further, to 1.5 per cent this year.Much of this downward revision results from a slowdown in China where factories and cities have been shut down to contain the virus. Countries strongly interconnected with China, such as Japan, Australia and South Korea, will also experience economic damage, the OECD says.The organisation\u0026nbspthinks the most likely scenario is that the effects of the virus will fade relatively soon. If the countries most exposed to coronavirus take effective\u0026nbspaction to mitigate the impact of coronavirus, global growth could rebound to 3.4 per cent next year.The OECD says: “A longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak, spreading widely throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America, would weaken prospects considerably.”In this scenario, economies in Europe and North America will also experience significant economic fallout from the virus.Demand is likely to be significantly hit across much of the world for an extended period, with countries accounting for 70 per cent of global GDP likely to be affected.Other countries may not fully replicate\u0026nbspChina’s tough restrictions on movement, but\u0026nbspmany of the economic impacts are likely to be similar.\u0026nbspThis would\u0026nbspsignificantly damage\u0026nbspconfidence, causing heightened uncertainty, while\u0026nbspvoluntary\u0026nbsprestraints on travel and commercial and sporting events are all likely to depress spending.On Sunday, the UK health secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out shutting down cities if the virus spreads widely in the country.\u0026nbspMr Hancock\u0026nbspsaid he would not take anything “off the table at this stage” when asked about a\u0026nbspWuhan-style\u0026nbspquarantine\u0026nbspby BBC’s Andrew Marr.“There’s clearly a huge economic and social downside to that but we don’t take anything off the table at this stage because you’ve got to make sure that you have all of the tools available if that is what’s necessary,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The tests simulate a range of potential shocks, including\u0026nbspa dramatic economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong. The Chinese economy has been impacted significantly by the virus with factories shut down and planes grounded, delivering a knock-on effect for companies that source goods and materials from China.We don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen, Mr Carney said.\u0026nbspCertainly the situation we are entering, the economic situation we are entering because of the virus - we didn\u0027t run a stress test against that specific situation but we can learn from the stress tests we\u0027ve been carrying out since 2014 about the resilience of the institutions against that type of risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don\u0027t have any zero contract hours,” he told the BBC.Wetherspoons said last week that its 45,000 employees would be paid statutory sick pay if they isolate themselves.

It is simply turning the inidual woman back into a breeder.”The author, who is about to publish the final part of her trilogy of works devoted to the life of Thomas Cromwell, previously condemned the perception of Kate Middleton in the tabloid press.She suggested in 2013 that Middleton’s public image was “designed by a committee and built by craftsmen, with a perfect plastic smile and the spindles of her limbs hand-turned and gloss-varnished”.Markle and her husband Prince Harry are to step down from their roles as senior royals on 31 March.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was doing so to ensure that they would not unexpectedly shut down, it said, but the admission led to a flurry of criticism over the fact that users were not informed.It has since rolled out a range of attempts to make that better, including a feature that will alert users when they are subject to the performance throttling and the option to turn it off.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow the company has agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle the claims. Apple and lawyers representing affected customers agreed to the deal as the fallout from the feature continues.As well as changing features in the software, the\u0026nbspadmission also led\u0026nbspto Apple offering discounted battery replacements at $29, but many people claimed they had already spent hundreds of dollars to buy new phones because Apple didn\u0027t reveal the cause of the problem. If they had known they could just buy new batteries, they might not have bought new phones, some consumers in the case said.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

These include anyone waiting for coronavirus test results, anyone who has come\u0026nbspinto contact with a confirmed infected person, and anyone returning from a country significantly disrupted by the virus.Instead of sending staff home, PHE recommends that if a workplace has a confirmed case of the virus then they\u0026nbspshould wait to be contacted by a local Health Protection Team to discuss and determine what measures, if any, should be taken.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: Cases soar of deadly new flu-like virus Show all 154Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

Time-management apps like RescueTume can help you stick to your schedule and maintain your regular hours.​What are your rights and will you still get paid?Any staff who have been asked to self-isolate are entitled to take the time as sick leave, according to health secretary Matt Hancock. He added that self-isolation should be considered “sickness for employment purposes”.How much pay a worker receives will depend on their contract, with most employers offering a certain number of sick days on full pay.Even if employers do not offer sick pay, workers are entitled to\u0026nbsp statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. It amounts to £94.25 per week and is paid from the fourth day of sickness.Those hardest hit will be anyone who is self-employed or who work in the gig economy, who are not entitled to SSP\u0026nbspif they self-isolate. The Department for Work and Pensions has said that anyone deemed a public health risk could claim universal credit or contributory employment and support allowance.​Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Brexit may be set to cost the UK more than £200 billion in lost economic growth by the end of this year but we will once again be able to travel with a blue passport. Result!”There were also those who felt compelled to point out the UK could have had blue passports at any point in the last 30 years, and that Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government had switched the colour to burgundy under no duress from the EU.“I want my classic Thatcher-approved burgundy passport back! How dare the Iron Lady’s memory be traduced by the introduction of a Croatia blue document,” joked one Twitter user.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seb Dance, who lost his position as a Labour MEP because of Brexit, tweeted magnanimously: “Well done on the design.

Otherwise, we risk a much faster and greater spreading of coronavirus.”Christina McAnea, Unison’s assistant general secretary, echoed the criticism, saying: “If they stay off work, staff need to know they have enough money to feed their families and pay rent.“Waiting up to five weeks to get benefits runs the risk of them covering up symptoms.”And Sue Harris, legal director at the GMB union, said, “For workers, or the self-employed, making a claim for universal credit is laborious and lengthy.Created with Sketch.

But rural and coastal communities voted out in large numbers during the 2016 referendum after the Vote Leave campaign argued that farmers and fishermen would be better off once free of EU rules.The government distanced itself from the official’s comments, adding: “We have made it clear the comments are not in line with government policy.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A home flooded after the River Aire burst its banks in East Cowick, East Yorkshire Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg takes part in a Youth Strike 4 Climate protest march in Bristol, south west England.

So absolutely\u0026nbspwe need our famers, and of course we are the bedrock of the largest manufacturing sector providing all those raw ingredients.\u0026nbsp“Clearly, there is a cold economic case. But you have to look at the wider aspect of all of this: farms are the backbone of rural Britain. Surely the last thing we want to go to is importing cheaper, raw ingredients produced to lower standards. We export our conscience and our production.”\u0026nbspLast week, the environment secretary George Eustice came in for criticism after he refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US as part of a trade agreement with Washington.Fishermen also fear promises made to them about\u0026nbspincreased catch quotas and controlling who fishes in British waters could be traded in exchange for market access during the talks with the EU, which are due to begin next week.Brussels has made clear it wants little to change in terms of access for European boats and quota allocation once the transition period is over in December.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And so we must recognise that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our nation together, he said.

More delegates can be won on Super Tuesday than on any other day, so it’s sort\u0026nbspof a big deal.\u0026nbspWith states from all over the country voting, Super Tuesday typically represents a presidential candidate\u0027s first test of national electability. So all eyes will be on frontrunner Bernie Sanders going into Super Tuesday 2020. Will his erse coalition of voters pull through? Or was\u0026nbspSouth Carolina the start of a comeback streak for Joe Biden?It’s not just people living in America who vote on Super Tuesday.Democrats living across the world can vote in person and online in their own polls. Democrats Abroad functions just like its own state in the primary contest, sending 13 delegates to the Democratic Convention.\u0026nbspIn 2016, 35,000 Democrats voted across the world, from Australia, Britain and Guatemala, to India, Thailand and Norway 69 per cent of Democrats Abroad backed Sanders, while 31 per cent voted for his opponent Hillary Clinton.Why is it important for Democrats living abroad to use their votes?With 13 delegates, Democrats Abroad returns almost as many delegates to the all-important Democratic convention as states such as Vermont and Wyoming. This is despite the fact that population-wise\u0026nbspit has far fewer voters.\u0026nbspTravis Mooney-Evans, International Coordinator for Bernie Abroad – the global campaign for Bernie Sanders – told indy100:It is such a well kept secret that the voting power per capita is much higher in Democrats Abroad. By far and away it\u0027s three times the voting power of any other state.The Sanders campaign has been very active across the UK in particular, where Democrats can vote in person in London, Edinburgh, St Andrews, Oxford and Cambridge. Larry Sanders – Bernie’s older brother who represents the Green Party in the UK – is leading the campaign for his brother in Britain. In 2016, he read out the delegates awarded to his brother in a particularly moving moment from the Democratic convention.\u0026nbspAt a campaign event organised by Bernie 2020 UK, several Sanders supporters were planning on voting for him from abroad on Super Tuesday.One Sanders supporter\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbspI supported Sanders in the 2016 primary over here. Being a Florida voter I knew that my vote would have a much bigger impact in Dems abroad than in Florida because the polling for Sanders in 2016 wasn\u0027t good in Florida so I wanted to make sure he won here.We\u0027re out there canvassing all the time in London and the UK... We\u0027re constantly reminding people how they can vote.{{new}}{{#ads}}{{ads}}{{#ampAds}}{{ampAds}}Log in using your social network accountORLog in directly with Indy100{{message}}SubmitForgotten your password?Not registered?

Netanyahu incites better against the Arab public.”The Joint List is a political alliance of Israel’s four largest Arab-majority parties, which are opposed to Mr Netanyahu’s leadership.Likud members celebrate potential victoryAt the Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv,\u0026nbspthe room erupted into cheers and supporters, wielding enormous flags and blue balloons,\u0026nbspwelcomed the poll results\u0026nbspas confirmation of\u0026nbspa certain win.I’m feeling great and I think that the people of Israel have shown that they support the leadership of prime minister Netanyahu and the views of the Likud and the right-wing camp, \u0026nbspGilad Erdan, a Likud Knesset member (MK) told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Now we hope that the other parties will accept this verdict and will negotiate with us to establish a strong right-wing government, he added.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yes, there have been more than , confirmed cases of coronavirus in more than  countries around the world.But in the UK, where more than , people have been tested, there have been  confirmed cases.To date, there have been no deaths in the UK from coronavirus and only one Brit — an elderly cruise ship passenger in Japan — has died in total.So when Covid- is routinely referred to as the “killer virus”, that is something less than the whole truth. Because most people unfortunate enough to catch it recover.Even in China, where there have been over , cases, the ­numbers of ­infection are slowing.Containing the virus works. As we edge closer to a full-blown pandemic, a little perspective will go a long way.As those Brit tourists locked inside the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenere would probably tell you, the greatest threat posed by the virus is massive inconvenience, not sudden death.If you are not old, and have no pre- existing medical conditions, then coronavirus is slightly more le-threatening than regular flu — which killed , Brits last year.Every doctor will tell you that hands are a route of transmission — so keep them clean, and take a rain-check on handshakes, manly hugs and social kissing.Professor Hugh Pennington, a ­lecturer in diseases at Aberdeen University, says, “Just using ordinary soap and water is all that’s needed.It can make all the dference and really limit the spread of this virus.”We should be thinking about ­better personal hygiene rather than panic buying.I am not making the case for complacency. The world is facing the greatest health crisis for a ­generation.This week the first cases were seen in countries as far apart as Pakistan, Greece, Brazil, Nigeria and Wales.The cancelled sporting events are piling up. Schools are closing. The stock market is in freefall. This is not normal le.Personally, I am not getting on a plane until my daughter is the far side of her exams in the spring.My local gym has installed hand sanitisers and I use them.When I see someone coughing, I wish they had the common decency to cover their cakehole.But every one of us must walk the hard path between staying safe and staying sane.The Government’s worst-case scenario predicts half-a-million British deaths from the virus — which would exceed the number of British military and civilian deaths in World War Two.Is Covid- REALLY deadlier than living through — and fighting in — World War Two The Government should ditch the scare stories and tell us how to stay healthy. They should keep repeating how simple personal hygiene habits can contain the spread of Covid-.Keep calm, carry on and wash your hands.For as any doctor will tell you, there is nothing more contagious than panic.ANA De Armas is doing the heavy lting in promoting the new Bond film, No Time To Die.In the last week alone, Ana has appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair and Porter magazines. What’s lovely about the Cuban goddess is that she actually seems happy to be in a James Bond movie.“I was jumping all over the place and very excited,” she says about getting her role as CIA agent Paloma.In stark contrast, it is hard to imagine grumpy old Daniel Craig jumping with excitement at anything to do with the Bond franchise.“I don’t even call them Bond girls,” grumbles downbeat Dan.It’s like having Victor Meldew playing .DAVID Dimbleby, the nearest thing the BBC has to royalty, claims that: “The whole idea of a national broadcaster that speaks truth to the nation and is impartial and objective is under threat.”But whose fault is that Millions of us blame the BBC. Because during the great national debate about Brexit, the BBC was openly, unapologetically biased.The orthodoxy of BBC opinion is totally out of touch with the people who fork out the £billion a year for the licence fee.For years the BBC told those people that they are thick, ignorant racists who would all soon be dead.If the BBC had been “impartial and objective” in recent years, it would not be ripe for losing the licence fee.Prince Harry and the Queen have always seemed close.And in a family that is not big on displays of affection, the Queen’s face always seemed to light up in her grandson’s cheeky, ginger-bonce presence.But his North American exile means Harry will now see far less of his grandmother,  this April.If Harry has an IQ bigger than Meghan’s shoe size, I bet he will live to regret it.STORM Dennis, Storm Ciara and now Storm Jorge.For three weeks in a row, rain and floods have brought abject misery across the country from the north of England to Wales – the same areas that gave Boris Johnson his -seat majority.Homes have been ruined.

What is he afraid of That someone will shout at him  You really need to man up, put on your wellies and get out there, Boris.Because right now it looks like you don’t give a toss.PROMOTER Frank Warren is right – a fight between Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua would be the biggest British sporting event since the  World Cup Final.ButJoshua fights someone  next – Kubrat Pulev is currently booked for June – then anything could happen, just as it did in AJ’s first clash with Bart Simpson’s stunt double, Andy Ruiz.Fury and Joshua should do it at Wembley, do it next and claim their place in history.If Tyson does not take on AJ next, then they may never fight at all.WHITNEY Houston, who died in  at the tragically young age of , is on tour as a hologram.Apparently, the Whitney hologram is convincing, especiallyyou don’t sit too close.

This even earned comparisons with former Chancellor Phil “Spreadsheet” Hammond, another stick-in-the-mud Eeyore. But though senior civil servants should advise ministers discreetly, ultimately they must do their bidding.The Government won its large majority on a manesto of change. It cannot be ruled by Sir Humphreys, employing every trick in the book to delay and frustrate those elected to enact the will of the people.Sir Philip is a £,-a-year knighted bureaucrat who will no doubt end up with a gold-plated pension far beyond the dreams of ordinary workers.Instead of bleating he should face the reality of the situation.If he can’t or won’t do the job, the Government has to get someone who can.CONVICTED foreign thugs are already dodging deportation by using human rights laws.To add insult to injury, the taxpayer is coughing up millions of pounds to pay their legal bills.“Mr Big” drugs dealer Courtney Byndloss  hit the legal aid jackpot, racking up nearly £million for his fight against deportation.

Is it conceivable under any circumstance, you try and cut off the city in this country ”Mr Hancock replied:  Theres clearly a huge economic and social downside to that.But we don’t take anything off the table at this stage, because you’ve got to make sure that you have all the tools available,that is what’s necessary.But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption.It may be too early to make such calls but the top priority is keeping the public safe, he said.And a vaccine is still months away from being developed.Ministers will this week look at emergency powers they might needthe virus continues to spread - to make sure Britain is fully prepared.Under the worst-case scenario, we would have to take quite signicant action, Mr Hancock told the BBC.We will be publishing battle plans this week that sets those things out.It came as:Health officials are desperate to trace those who were in touch with the man who had walked into a GP surgery in Haslemere,  Surrey.They have not found anything linking him to someone who had been to an affected region abroad.A doctor from the practice also has symptoms, ex-Health Secretary and local MP Jeremy Hunt said.A senior health source said: “This is our nightmare scenario. It’s spreading uncontrollably and we are losing our grip.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning said the Government already were able to forcibly quarantine members of the populationthey were at risk.And thanks to large-scale No Deal planning in the past six months, the country already has stockpiles of several types of drug that could be usedneeded to try and treat the virus.He also cast into doubt the information coming from other countries such as China and Iran on coronavirus - amid fears they are suppressing the true number of people affected.We dont think all the figures from around the world are fully accurate, he said.We update [our] figures all the time... but we dont say any of those figures are concrete and definitive.The Health Secretary said today people should scrub their mitts for at least  seconds to destroy as many germs as possible.He told Radio  Live: You should do that for  seconds or more, and the way we explain it to children is that you should sing… wash your hands as long as you’re singing either Happy Birthday or God Save The Queen.Experts have warned that desperate moves to contain the Covid- outbreak could decimate all sport across the UK for months.Clubs yesterday began taking their own precautions to protect star players from infection.Tottenham’s injured South Korean ace Son Heung-min, , has been forced to self-isolate for two weeks after ing from his home country, where hundreds of cases have erupted.Last night the outbreak was casting a shadow over horse racing’s historic Cheltenham Festival, which begins in  days time.Organisers insist it is “full steam ahead” for the four-day meeting.But the odds of racing not taking place on the first day were a mere   last night.Cheltenham expects , spectators to attend the festival and the event in Gloucestershire will not take place without them.Rugby has already been hit by the postponement of next week’s Six Nations clash between Ireland and virus-plagued Italy.Englands football friendly against Italy at Wembley on Friday March  is still officially on — though it is subject to review.The Chinese Formula One Grand Prix scheduled for April  has been postponed, while other races are in doubt.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others are on borrowed time.Casualties could yet include the biggest fish of all, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill — Rutnam’s predecessor at the Home Office.If he survives, it will be at the cost of his second huge job as head of national security.Few of these shadowy Whitehall aristocrats will welcome Sir Calamity’s decision to wash their dirty linen in public.And with a career-long ­catalogue of costly blunders to his name, drama queen ­Rutnam could yet regret suing for unfair dismissal.Witnesses might testy to his “sneaky and snivelling” ­managerial style — including perhaps Amber Rudd, who blames him for destroying her career as a Cabinet high-flier.Rutnam left her to swing for his department’s unforgivable Windrush scandal and the deportation of innocent West Indian migrants.As Ms Rudd fell on her sword, Rutnam “went missing”.“She repeatedly asked for the information but it was never forthcoming,” says a friend.“Then a week after she resigned, the data was made available. The whole thing was very odd.”In other words, it stinks.Sir Philip had little time for Priti Patel.“He seemed to think Priti was stupid and treated her as such,” says an insider.Once exposed to daylight, such arrogance, coupled with third-party allegations of racism, can be politically explosive.We are witnessing a deceptively important battle on the home front, fought in parallel with Brexit.Downing Street believes it is winning the fight for ­sovereignty. But the mandarins are fighting a Fth Column battle to keep Britain tied to the EU’s apron strings.“The first six months are critical,” says a senior ­ministerial source. “It’s all to play for.”MILLIONAIRE lawyer “Sir” Keir Starmer QC – he pretends to hate the title – is now a racing certainty for Jeremy Corbyn’s job as Labour leader.This chameleon politician is a protege of Labour dud Gordon Brown.

eastenders","story":"It feels like it’s been going at least  years, partly because it survives on just half a dozen endlessly repeated stories, but also due to the fact its shrill tone, right-on agenda and obsession with long-suffering, alcoholic women and spineless men has been copied by almost every other mainstream drama on TV.Take, for instance, last night, where you had the choice of ITV’s Liar or BBC’s The Split.Such a miserable offering, I flipped a coin, lost and ended up watching The Split.If you haven’t suffered like I have, I should explain this is basically just a middle-class version of EastEnders set in a family law firm run by matriarch Ruth and her daughters, who are straight from central soap casting.There’s Nina, the hot one, an alcoholic shoplter who can’t get a bloke.And there’s Hannah, who’s as plain as an envelope and has men fighting over her in the street.There is another one as well, Rose, who can’t get pregnant.But writer Abi Morgan hasn’t the ­faintest idea what to do with her, so the drama tends to revolve around the ­miserable-as-sin Hannah, played by Nicola Walker, who’s been having the least steamy affair in television history with a walking Grolsch advert called Christie Carmichael.They bonded over a mutual love of swimming and legal jargon and now refer to their encounters as “Grayling,” like it was a Prohibited Steps Order.He’s a bit of a git, obviously. As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds.

Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. The NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic.”The language on food standards such as GM food, chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef was left much more ambiguous.It said: “Any agreement will ensure high standards and protections for consumers and workers, and will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards.”Lting the GM ban paves the way for cheaper food on supermarket shelves.But it risks infuriating British farmers, who face being flooded with cheap American produce.Official trade talks with the US are expected to start in the middle of March.David Lawrence, senior political adviser at the Trade Justice Movement, warned: “The Government continues to deliberately miss the point on food standards, including chlorinated chicken, GM crops and hormone-fed beef.“While they repeatedly say that the UK won’t lower its own farming regulations, they have not ruled out importing food from the US that is made to these lower standards.“The fact is that some US farming practices are illegal in the UK, for health, environmental and animal welfare reasons, and there is no doubt that the government will be under immense pressure to allow these products into the UKit wants a trade deal with the US.”Today Ms Truss will become the first British minister to speak to the World Trade Organisation since the UK became a member in its own right following Brexit.Last night the US Trade Secretary Robert Lighthizer urged the UK to ditch its opposition to chlorinated chicken - a potential stumbling block to the talks.In a speech to the Oxford Union, he said: “I’ve had a lot of meals in America with a lot of European trade negotiators, and they’ve never been hesitant in ordering the chicken.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things are going great between us – we spent Christmas with each other’s families and we’re planning a trip together this summer. My only problem is, I don’t like her group of friends. They’re very shallow and always bitching and gossiping. They’ve never been that nice to me and I always feel I’m on trial every time we’re out with them. She’s not like the rest of them at all, so I’m confused about why she wants to hang out with them. They’re just not very nice and I don’t trust any of them. I hate the thought of these people being in our lives, but what can I do about it  I thought maybe it was just me, but then I invited some of my mates on a night out and they agreed with me – “What does she see in them ” was the general opinion. I’ve never told her how I really feel about them and don’t know whether I should. I don’t want it to become an issue that causes problems between us. What do you think  Coleen says I think perhaps you’re worrying about it more than you should. In reality, you probably don’t have to see them that much and, as your relationship develops, you’ll probably see even less of them. But you shouldn’t encourage her not to see them. They are her friends and maybe they have a shared history that goes way back to college or school. If you do start to interfere, she’ll resent it and you’ll come across as controlling. Would you accept itshe told you she didn’t like your mates and didn’t want you to see them  I know it’s not idealyou don’t get on with your partner’s friends, but most of the time it’s just the two of you and that’s what you have to focus on.

The doomsday document warns Brits could see more troops on the streets, sports matches and schools closed and police forced to abandon low-level crime to maintain public order. A fth of Brits could be off sick at once, an army of NHS staff could be pulled out of retirement and people turfed out of hospitals early - not to mention a dilemma for councils in dealing with more bodies. The pressures on services and wider society may start to become signicant and clearly noticeable, the document says. And even more than one in five could be off worktheyaposre caring for the sick. At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson insisted our country remains extremely well prepared. He said the Army could be called inneeded and sick pay rules would be kept under review. But Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned up to % of Brits could be infected, % of whom die - though he stressed it would probably be a lot lower than that.  Prof Whitty added: Even for the highest-risk group, the great majority of people will survive this. Soyou look at the Chinese data,you take the very oldest people, the great majority survive. So it is important to stress that. Andyouaposre talking about the low-risk groups the rate of mortality is well below %. So I think thereaposs always a danger people think this has actually got a higher risk than it actually has for them personally.A Downing Street press conference heard whole-city lockdowns like in China are unlikely - and there was “no need” to panic-buy goods, which could make the situation worse. But Boris Johnson admitted: There are long established plans by which the police will keep the public safe, prioritise those things they have to do. The Army is of course always ready to backfill as and when. But that is under the reasonable worst case scenario.  Meanwhile the government will consider passing new lawsnecessary to help public authorities cope - while the services we rely on may be reduced temporarily. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock is thought to have spoken to chiefs at social media firms, including Twitter, urging them to help the responsible spread of accurate information about the outbreak. Now remember, this is only a potential plan for later stages of the outbreak - which the government doesnapost expect for weeks or even months,it happens in the UK. But bearing that in mind, what exactly does it say  Hereaposs a guide to  key points. . Remember! For now, the advice is pretty much what you know already  Itaposs important to stress that the governmentaposs plan has four stages - contain, delay, research, mitigate. Currently we are still on Stage One, and the plan accounts for all four stages over a period of several months. For now, the public health advice is much simpler than most of whataposs in the document:Follow public health advice on hand washing -  seconds with hot water and soap Rely only on trusted sources of information such as the government and NHS websites Check and follow the latest Foreign Office travel advice Check your family’s vaccinations for other conditions are up to date Check on elderly or vulnerable family, friends and neighbours Use NHS , pharmacies and GPsand only go to AE when really needed Go into self-isolationyou are advised to by the NHS, but not otherwiseAuthorities already have the legal power to “detain and direct” people in quarantined areas, and apply for court orders to force people to undergo quarantine and medical examination” - under emergency laws passed in the last few weeks. Itaposs thought the main way the virus is transmitted isyouaposre standing less than  metres from someone who sneezes, for example. Oryou touch a surface that has droplets from a cough or sneeze, and then touch your face. Thataposs why handwashing is so important.  The reason the plan has been drawn up is because, as it admits, “it may be that widespread exposure in the UK is inevitable. Weaposre all susceptible to catching the disease”, because thereaposs no vaccine and no natural immunity in our bodies yet. Officials believe the containment phase is almost over and whataposs more, the course of the disease cannot be predicted accurately at this point”. The strategy is to delay the peak of the outbreak as much as possible until the summer, when the NHS is under less strain from other illnesses like flu. That also “buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines, the plan says. If we do reach the third and particularly the fourth stages of the outbreak - hereaposs what might happen. Andwidespread exposure happens... . Gatherings like football matches may be banned  The plan confirms that large gatherings, like sports matches or the London Marathon, could be banned. It says: “Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategiesto slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, whilst ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible. However, there is no information currently about which events might be banned, for how long, or with how much notice - because itaposs simply too early to tell. The plan says: “Such judgements will be informed based on the best available and and most up-to-date scientic evidence and taken into account the trade-offs involved.” By apostrade-offsapos, the government is talking about the hit to the economy and public order. When it comes to sports matches, itaposs thought the risk could be higher from cramming into the pub afterwards than the actual match. Thataposs because itaposs thought the virus can only usually be transmitted in close proximity.  The plan makes clear troops could be used to support public bodies like the NHS and councils. It says: The Ministry of Defence has put in place plans to ensure the deliver of its key operations in the UK and overseas. There are also well-practised arrangements for Defence to provide support to Civil Authoritiesrequired. . A fth of all Brits could be off work at once  The plan admits everyone will face increased pressures at work, not to mention caring for themselves and others who might have the virus. It states: In a stretching scenario, it is possible that up to one fth of employees may be absent from work during peak weeks. This may y for inidual businesses. There will be case-by-case mitigation for small firms unable to pay their taxes or other duties due to cash flow issues. This will be run through HMRCaposs Time to Pay system. . Police could have to abandon low-level crime  Police and firefighters would be among the hardest-hita fth of Brits end up off work. The plan says they will “enact business continuity plans to ensure they are able to maintain a level of service that fulfils their critical s. For example, with a signicant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order.” . Councils face dealing with more bodies in makesht morgues  The plan does not explicitly refer to bodies and morgues but it makes reference to them obliquely. It says: “There could well be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly amongst vulnerable and elderly groups.” Councils are to be given advice by central government on “dealing with this challenge”, it adds. Councils are the organisations responsible for dealing with death registrations, morgues and inquests - and inquests already have a very long waiting time, taking months or even years to complete. . Patients could be turfed out of hospitals early  If there is a serious outbreak, health and social care bodies would be asked to work together to support early discharge from hospital and to look after people in their own homes, the plan says. Patients could also be turned away from hospitalthey have low-level conditions and routine operations could be postponed. The plan saysdoctors and nurses themselves become ill in large numbers, NHS hospitals may recommend a signicantly dferent approach to admissions. That would see staff re-deployed to prioritise and triage service delivery. . NHS volunteers could be brought out of retirement The pressures on the NHS - especiallydoctors and nurses become sick - could force people whoaposve left or retired from the NHS to come back. Staff rostering changes may be necessary, including calling leavers and retirees back to duty, the plan says. . Schools could be closed  The clear advice is that schools should not close unless specically directed to by Public Health England. That advice would continue, but it may well be that more schools are told to close by the authorities. The governmentsapos education departmentsapos planning assumptions include the possibility of of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection, the plan adds.  . People could have to work more from home As stated above , workplaces could count as large-scale gatherings and need to send people home. However, the plan suggests this would be encouraged rather than enforced , and obviously there are some professions where itaposs not possible. . Contact tracing could have to be abandoned  At the moment health authorities are piling huge resources into painstakingly tracing every person that an infected patient came into contact with. However, as the virus spreads this may become impossible, or a bad use of resources that could be used to treat the sick. The plan says contact tracing “may lose effectiveness” and officials may need to direct their resources where in future. The Chief Medical Officer said there may come a point where it’s “so great” that containment “ceases to make sense”. He added: “We have not reached that point, but we could reach that point.” . Medicine stockpiles would start being depleted  The UK “maintains strategic stockpiles of the most important medicines and protective equipment” for healthcare staff, the plan says. “These stocks are being monitored daily, with additional stock being ordered where necessary”. However, the plan says the UK may need to draw down on stockpiles of medicines and medical devices in the case of a widespread outbreak. There are no numbers of estimates of how quickly this might happen. . And there could yet be ‘multiple waves’ of the illness It may not be a simple case of one peak, the plan says - and a more long term plan may be needed. “It is possible that an outbreak or pandemic of COVID- could occur in multiple waves”, it says. . But despite it all, the government says weaposre well-placed to deal with it These are all doomsday plans, of course. But the government is also trying to reassure people. The plan says the government has “planned extensively over the years for an event like this, and the UK is therefore well prepared to respond in a way that offers substantial protection to the public.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britain needs follow hollands example","story":"NewsBritain needs to follow Hollands example to conquer devastating floodsEXCLUSIVE: Turning the tide - how Holland conquered flooding, its grey monster which killed , people, and the lessons Britain needs to learn from a nation which has since prevented further deathsShareCommentsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video week-weather-ice-rain-wind-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news britain-needs-follow-hollands-example-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

They spent the freezing night floating along on fragments of the roof. Not all of them survived. Mina Kooijman, who was  at the time of the ordeal in , said she watched the sea water in their village in the Netherlands rush towards them “like a grey monster”. Around , of her compatriots were killed. It kick-started huge investment in flood defences, and no one has been killed by floods since then. Experts now say Britain needs to follow the Dutch example. The catastrophic storm in the North Sea in  killed more than  people in the UK and caused the MV Princess Victoria to sink off the coast, taking the lives of  more.At .pm on January , a telegram warning of “extremely dangerous high water” was issued by the Dutch Met Office .But few organisations subscribed to the telegram service in the low-lying nation and hardly anyone in the worst-hit areas was warned. The force of the waves burst the nation’s dykes and in a few hours water filled homes in the Zeeland province to the second floor. Mina’s family in the farming community of Nieuwerkerk, south west of Rotterdam, made their way into the attic then out on to the roof of their barn as the water rose. She later recalled: “We saw my gran, Uncle Pau and housekeeper [floating] by on a raft. A little later they disappeared into the water.  “Then the barn roof broke into pieces. My father and brother Han were on a separate piece of roof. “My mother, brother Wim, sister Hanna and I were on another.” After hours bobbing along in the wind and rain, the family reached a dyke and found refuge in a small house that had taken in  others who were suddenly homeless.  But -year-old Han did not make it. When the high water peaked at am, many people were caught out while sleeping. The North Sea flood was the worst disaster in the Netherlands during the th century. As well as the death toll, , buildings were flooded. The damage ran into tens of billions of pounds in today’s money.  Within  days, the Dutch government created a commission to try to ensure the country was never devastated by floods again. Billions were spent on the Delta Works, the largest flood protection system in the world. As well as  storm barriers, work included strengthening dykes, widening rivers and a system of drainage ditches, canals, sandbanks and pumping stations.  The jewel in the crown is the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier, completed in , which is nearly six miles long. Flood prevention is a source of national pride, evident as Jeroen Kramer, from the Water Management Information Centre, shows me around what he called “the Netherlands’ front door”. The Maeslantkering, said to be the world’s largest robot, is the storm surge barrier protecting the port of Rotterdam and over a million people. Completed in , it consists of two metal arms the size of the Efel Tower.  They stay open to allow ships to pass, but are ready to close when the water rises by ft. Jeroen says when a nation suffers major floods people there ask: “What are the Dutch doing ” The Maeslantkering cost taxpayers €million. He said: “In the Netherlands, we regard water as a national problem and everybody expects to pay.” Environmental scientist Angela Terry thinks the UK must spend much more on defences.  She said: “Investment in world-leading flood schemes is a sense of national pride [with the Dutch] yet in England only % of national infrastructure spending goes on protection... “As the world warms due to carbon emissions, sea levels are rising due to... melting ice. “As an island nation we are vulnerable on our entire coast.”  Ria Geluk, who was six when the  disaster hit the Netherlands and who survived by getting on to the roof, led a grassroots movement to found the WatersnoodMuseum, in Ouwerkek which opened in  as a memorial to the catastrophe. Ria, , said: “In  I think the Netherlands had a preview of what the future could look like for many in a world of global heating. “It took the  disaster for real action to be taken here. Will you [in Britain] wait for another one ” Peter Glas, the scientist in charge of protecting the Netherlands against floods, last week warned Britain should prepare for seas and tidal rivers to rise by over ft in  years – nearly double the Met Office’s worst-case predictions. Such a rise could inundate towns along estuaries and wreck places miles inland on tidal rivers such as the Thames, Severn, Wye and Tyne.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailRestricting travel for Britons and UK visitors to prevent the spread of coronavirus would be pointless, a health chief has suggested. The chief scientic adviser to the Government, Sir Patrick Vallance, said it would be too late, adding: “Once the epidemic is everywhere, then actually restricting travel makes no dference at all. “At the moment we are certainly not recommending any change to behaviours in relation to that. “Andit grows in the UK, then of course it doesn’t really make more sense to say that you’re at more risk somewhere  than you are here.” Follow our live blog for the latest updates on coronavirus. But Professor Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, added: “If you happen to be in a place with a very weak health service at the peak of their epidemic, weaker than the NHS, that obviously might be more problematic - and this is particularly an issue for people who are older or have pre-existing health conditions.” The pair were speaking alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday as the Government outlined its -page coronavirus battle plan. Many countries have implemented travel restrictions in a desperate bid to prevent the spread of the killer bug. Thailand is forcing visitors from some of the worst-affected countries, including Italy, to quarantine themselves for  days upon arrival.  Singapore has banned entry to travellers from Italy, Iran and South Korea, and anyone who has visited those countries within the last  days. Several airlines have stopped flying to China and Italy. A major outbreak could see the Army on the streets, police ignoring minor crimes and a fth of workers absent, the Government has warned. The military could also provide support to emergency servicesneeded, the action plan says.  The NHS could delay non-urgent care and call retired doctors and nurses back to duty, schools could close and big events could be bannedextraordinary measures are needed to curb the spread of the flu-like illness in the UK. Prof Whitty said up to % of Britons could catch the bug in a worst-case scenario and one per cent of those infected may die. There would be a relatively high death rate among the elderly and frail. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that  people have now tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, up from  the day before.

Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said the number of people who have the disease but are not showing symptoms is not yet clear. Speaking about what the Government did not know, he said: The proportion of people who have no symptoms at all. Thataposs because we donapost currently have tests which can work outsomeone has had an infection with no symptoms at all. So it may be for example in China a very large number of people have been infected with no symptoms and are not being counted in the numbers. He added that there is a signicant ramp up in the death rate of those infected who are over  years old. The exact percentages will depend on a lot of factors - including the health care system you have in place, so I would not expect... the numbers we are seeing in China automatically to read over to the UK, the professor said. The chief medical officer, speaking alongside the Prime Minister, added that probably around one per cent of those infected may die, although the death rate depends on age. The Government reportedly plans to create extra mortuary space amid fears the outbreak could cause a spike in deaths among the elderly.Professor Whitty stressed that the great majority survive coronavirus, even among the elderly.  Even for the highest risk group, the great majority of people will survive this. If you look at the Chinese data,you take the very oldest people, the great majority survive. He added: If youaposre talking about the low-risk groups, the rate of mortality is well below %. The outbreak could lead to a fth of workers being absent, cause the police to drop low-priority cases and force the NHS to delay non-urgent care, according to the Governmentaposs battle plan. The -page document sets out the UK-wide response to Covid- amid widespread concerns about the impact the virus will have on peopleaposs wellbeing, the economy and public services. Measures aimed at delaying the spread of the virus could include school closures, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings and encouraging greater home working. The Governmentaposs response is in four stages: containing the outbreak, delaying its spread and mitigating the impact of the disease once it becomes established, and alongside that, a research programme is aimed at improving diagnostics and treatment for the disease.

Andrew Bland took his own le in  just before he was due to move back in with his parents Richard and Sue.Instead of welcoming the -year-old home, they received a knock on the door from a police officer explaining he was dead, Stoke Sentinel reported. Seven years on from the dad-of-oneaposs death, his parents leave the landing light on in memory of him. Richard said: “Andrew was going to come home on the Saturday. “But on the Friday night we got the knock on the door. Andrew had problems in the past of being a bit naughty and when I saw the police, I just said, ‘what’s he done’. But the officer said, ‘it’s more serious than that, can we come in’. “They told us what had happened. It was shock, horror, and disbelief – complete and utter disbelief. “The first thing you do is telephone everyone. Our youngest son couldn’t cope with it. In the end the police took me to him to calm him down, he couldn’t deal with it. He still can’t. He certainly can’t understand why Andrew did it. For two months the couple didnapost go to bed, instead choosing to sleep on the sofa downstairs. You think you are dreaming it, the -year-old said. “If he had died in a car crash or had a heart attack, or even been shot and murdered you could understand it. But you can’t understand or accept him killing himself. “You get very angry. If I had known how he felt I would have dragged him home and locked him up in the house. “But there’s no anger towards Andrew. He’s at rest now, he’s at peace.  For Richard and Sue, Andrewaposs death weighs most heavily on them on Fridays. “Now every Friday is the same. It all comes back, Richard said. “Every Friday we relive it. There are a few little noises around the house and you think, ‘Andrew’. “Do I dread Fridays  If you were to ask me at pm, I would say, ‘yes’. It depends on how busy I am. If you were to ask Sue, she would probably say, ‘every minute’. “When we heard what had happened there was a light on in the hall and that has been on every night since. We won’t turn it off in case Andrew wants to come home.” Before the financial crash in  Richard ran a thriving family firm selling security safes to banks. The economic downturn saw the company collapse and Andrew and his brothers cast out of work. “When we had the business we were very careful to make sure the kids benefited, but they worked so hard - it was seven days-a-week,  hours-a-day,” said Richard. “We lost everything in the crash, that was devastating. “I can’t say [Andrew’s death] was totally caused by the collapse of the business, but that was a long way towards it. “You never get over the loss of a son. “It destroyed our family. My eldest son was as fit as a fiddle. He was always outgoing and he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for charity and ran up Mount Snowdon. Not anymore. He’s really suffered.

This is my kind of greeting! “Be prepared for a mass outbreak of athlete’s foot!”, another person joked. People around the world are rejecting handshakes and refusing kisses in an attempt to reduce the spread of the disease. Swiss people should consider dropping the everyday greeting of kissing each other on the cheeks to avoid spreading the coronavirus, the health minister said.  Meanwhile, France has also recommended that the customary aposLa Biseapos greeting should be dropped.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that coronavirus would not stop him greeting people with a handshake, adding that he had shaken the hands of everyone at a hospital where infected patients were being treated.Mr Johnson told reporters at a press conference in Downing Street: I am shaking hands.

Obviously, we look at it by position to try to make them better technically and tactically but we want all players comfortable in taking the ball.“We’re not fixated on systems and formations right across the club, we want to do what’s right for our inidual players.“It’s also about getting us to empower the coaches to be able to deliver those same messages across the board. We’re constantly reviewing and adapting our model. We don’t want to just stand still. We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club. The calibre of people you are working with on a daily basis is great. We’ve got some of the best people around.“If you look at the profile of the type of player this club tends to produce, there’s a creative flair but we want to help by giving them as much information as possible.”Payne added: “Logan Chalmers and Keiran Freeman are next in line.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e5ce776b724e6.95875127-scaled.jpg ","title":"mcpake and dee make good use of idle saturday after arbroath clash called off","story":"Dundee mounted a spying mission on their next three opponents after Saturday’s clash with Arbroath was called off.With the Dens Park pitch waterlogged, the Dark Blues squad headed instead to an impromptu indoor training session at the city’s Regional Performance Centre.But the day wasn’t over for the Dee coaching staff.First-team coach Dave Mackay was dispatched to Ayr’s Championship win over Alloa, while assistant boss Jimmy Nicholl saw Dunfermline down Dundee United at East End Park.The Dark Blues face the Wasps tomorrow night, before a double header with the Honest Men is rounded off by a visit from the Pars a week on Saturday.And, despite gaffer James McPake’s irritation with the weekend call-off, he is pleased with how his staff worked it to their advantage. vw, px\"  “It was a frustrating one,” admitted James.“We’d worked all week in preparation for Arbroath and, by the time Saturday comes around, you’re desperate to get out there.“But, at the same time, the pitch was nowhere near playable and the referee who came in to do the inspection made the call.“It’s a pain but it’s part of football. The games are stacking up a wee bit but we just have to get on with it.“We trained on Saturday and it’s one of those occasions when we’re grateful to have access to the indoor facility at the Regional Performance Centre.“It was a good session, which kept us ticking over for Tuesday night, and there were actually positives to the game going off.“Dave watched Alloa and Ayr on Saturday afternoon and Jimmy went to Dunfermline against Dundee United, which was obviously useful for the days ahead in terms of preparation.“So there’s frustration but we took the good side of it, too.”Meanwhile, James reacted to news of the club’s latest financial figures.The Dark Blues revealed losses of £. million at teatime on Friday – more than four times greater than the previous year’s deficit .The figures show how heavily the cost of relegation has hit Dundee in the pocket, with squad and managerial churn blamed for much of the club’s increased expenditure.Financial predictions for next year are also bleak.But the club’s majority shareholder – Tim Keyes and John Nelms’ Football Partners Scotland– have committed, in a statement released alongside the accounts, to continue providing funds.For the manager, who has enjoyed daily support from Nelms, that came as no surprise.But McPake remains aware of the pressing need toas quickly as possible to the Premiership, given the havoc dropping into the Championship has wreaked on the club’s balance sheet.“Some of it I can’t control but the bit of it I can control is the budget I’ve been given,” he said.“Regardless of what  has been going on and wherever  money has been needed, the owners have backed me from start to finish.“I have absolutely no complaints on that front. That has been the same for every other manager they have employed here – they’ve all been backed.“What we can do on the playing side is, as I’ve said before, make sure come April, May time, we’ve given ourselves the best possible chance of getting back to the Premiership.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Person-wearing-Medical-Face-Mask-to-protect-against-Coronavirus-Covid-19_34708990-599x372.jpg ","title":"people urged not to panic after first case of coronavirus diagnosed in tayside","story":"Tayside residents have been urged not to panic after it was confirmed Scotland#s first case of coronavirus was found in the area.The patient, understood to be from the Arbroath area, had recently ed from a trip to Italy and was taken to a hospital outside of Tayside as a precaution.Yesterday during a briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the patient was admitted to a facility, but is not seriously ill.While news of the virus arriving on Scottish shores has understandably been met with some anxiety among the public, an NHS Tayside source has urged people to remain calm.The health worker, who asked not to be named, said: #There is absolutely no need to panic. This can be controlled with good hygiene practices.#If we were going to end up in a situation with public buildings such as schools and the universities being closed down it would have happened already.#I genuinely don#t believe we are in that type of situation. The further the infection moves from its epicentre the weaker it becomes.#The first minister confirmed the patient#s self-referral was #handled entirely in line# with procedures.In Dundee the sight of people wearing protective masks, familiar from news footage in China and other affected countries, is becoming increasingly common.Yanxia Fu, a -year-old bachelor’s student at Dundee University, explained why she had begun wearing a mask.She said: “I just started today. We wear masks so thatwe become infected we don’t pass it on to others.“Getting it is a concern for us. We’re on our way to use some hand sanitiser now.”Yilan Xu, a -year-old who lives in Hawkhill, was also wearing a mask.She said: “It’s just to prevent any possible spread of the virus and keep everyone safe.“I’ve basically been living the same as before, just washing my hands more and keeping clean.“I think it’ll all be okay.#Meanwhile, others were calling for greater intervention from the UK and Scottish governments.Andy Douglas, , a retired security guard at Ninewells who lives on Arbroath Road, said : “It does worry me.“I think the government should act more quickly and totally ban people from leaving the country and going abroad.#However, others were less alarmed and were sceptical of the risk the virus presented.Barry Allan, , a student from Broughty Ferry, said: “It’s not something which worries me.“I know it’s infectious but it’s just young people and old people that are at risk.“I’m just living how I normally would. I think this whole thing has been blown out of proportion.”The Tele has also learned of instances where Tayside residents who have ed from at risk places and who fear they may have the virus have been taken by ambulance to hospital for tests.The residents claimed ambulance crews wore infection protection hazard suits and said the emergency vehicles were being deep cleaned on a daily basis.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said the administration did not comment on inidual cases but added: “Appropriate infection prevention and control measures are carried out in line with guidance issued by Health Protection Scotland.”Rumours that pupils at St Paul’s Academy and other schools in Dundee had been affected by the virus have been dismissed.A tweet from St Paul’s said: “NHS Tayside have just in the last hour confirmed that there are no confirmed cases of the coronavirus linked to any school at all in Tayside, including St Paul’s.”Angus Council#s provost Ronnie Proctor said that the best advice he could give was for people to be vigilant and not panic.Mr Proctor said: #Obviously our thoughts are with the infected person but it is important that we don#t panic about the confirmed case in Tayside.#If anyone has any concerns about any symptoms they should contact the relevant authorities and they should self-quarantine themselves while they await further advice,#Arbroath councillor Derek Wann said: #Angus Council has contingency plans in place to deal with any outbreak.#We are continuing to have briefings and any necessary action will take place. In the meantime I would urge everyone to follow advice and make sure that most of all they follow basic hygiene rules and keep washing their hands.#Meanwhile, Perth and Kinross councillor Murray Lyle said: #Working with our partners in the Tayside Resilience Partnership, Perth and Kinross Council is well-prepared for a potential outbreak of coronavirus, following established contingency plans for events like this.#The multi-agency resilience group has been meeting over the last two weeks to ensure the co-ordination and consistency of our response.#We are following the advice of NHS at national and Tayside level in relation to prevention and infection control, and would encourage our communities to do the same. Information is available via the www.nhsinform.scot website.#People have a vital role to play in helping us contain any outbreak by following the latest health and travel advice, and following basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.#Coronavirus has spread from Wuhan in China across the world, with tens of thousands of confirmed cases and thousands of deaths.What’s the scale of the problem China has reported nearly , cases and almost , deaths. Outside China, there have been cases in nearly  countries with about  deaths.What’s happening in the UK There have been  confirmed cases, with more than , people having been tested –  diagnosed in England, one in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. Yesterday Scotland reported its first case # a Tayside resident who recently travelled from Italy.What is a coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from theWhere did it come from Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people, the World Health Organisation says. The first cases were in people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.How is it spread The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with the virus coughs or exhales.How can you stop it Thorough hand-washing, keeping distance from others, and avoiding hand-shakes are among the most effective measures. Everyday precautions like carrying hand sanitiser, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, rather than your hands, and binning used tissues immediately is also helpful, according to the NHS.What are the symptoms Initial symptoms include fever, cough, tightness of the chest, shortness of breath and breathing dficulties. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to death.There are no specic treatments or vaccines but symptoms can be treated.Can people with no symptoms spread the virus The jury is still out on this one, although scientists believe there is evidence of asymptomatic transmission. The Department of Health has said it believes the risk of catching coronavirus from someone with no symptoms at all is low – but it is possible to catch it from someone who has mild symptoms.Are some groups more at risk The UK Government says based on current evidence most cases appear to be mild and those who have died in Wuhan appear to have had pre-existing health conditions.The World Health Organisation has said about four in five people who contract the virus get mild symptoms and recover.But it added older people or patients with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes are more at risk of developing serious illness."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/DNic_Tele_Fball_Podcast-8-scaled-e1582122918392-940x547.jpg ","title":"tiddler forbes could do with a ball what no other mortal could","story":"“Once upon a time, there was a city that had an urban identity – a core identity, a sports identity.This spoke wondrous tales of glories past and what might have been.That city was Dundee – a Dundee of another time.That was the opening lines of Rob Boag’s latest contribution to BwB.He continued: “The Overgate, the Wellgate, the Murrygate and Westport were a landscape teeming with humanity every Saturday.“Families dressed in their finest as they deserted the tenements and invaded shops and department stores.“And inside inner-city pubs, what was there to talk about  Not the mills, or factories, or the boatyard. It was sport, it was boxing, it was football – and every pub on that landscape was steeped in stories of legends and heroes of renown.“And on such a Saturday at noon in , I, an apprentice, along with four journeymen, left our job site at Dundee University and headed along Park Place toward Hawkhill.“It was agreed we would stop and have one pint – no more, then be off on our separate ways.“My elusive memory can’t decide which pub we entered, it was either Mickey Coyle’s or The Globe.“Whatever establishment it was, business was ramping up to a steady Saturday afternoon crowd.”Betting was illegal in those days, but there were ways around that, as Rob continued: “Standing at the bar sipping on a pint was a bookie’s runner making his rounds of the local pubs.“From punters, he accepted money and slips of paper signed with a nom-de-plume and scribed with a meticulous studied selection of racing form – along with hopes and dreams of a Saturday night windfall.“As pints were poured, the discussion continued.“The euphoria from Dundee’s very own Dick McTaggart’s recent magnicent and glorious Olympic achievement had mellowed and everyone had evolved from a fan to a McTaggart advisor – should Dick turn professional or stay amateur and become an ambassador for his sport “As a young lad I was undergoing my indoctrination into the protocol of behaviour in the company of elders in a licensed establishment.“And I watched and listened to the debate of the journeymen as they detailed the pros and cons of stepping up from amateur to professional in the sweet science of boxing.“The advice was well thought out and worthy of consideration. But it was Dick who made his own decision – a decision he doesn’t regret.”The discussion then suddenly veered into who was the best football player to ever play in Dundee Junior leagues.Rob went on: “The journeymen were veterans of WW, when young men of their generation had lived and breathed football in that glorious sports decade of the ’s when Dundee was saturated with talent and the city was a giant encompassing sports stadium.“They were men from another time.“A name came forth – Tiddler Forbes.“According to two of the journeymen, he was the greatest dribbler of a ball – bar none.“They were emphatic that Tiddler could do things with a ball that no other mortal could.“Some years ago, I am positive I read in BwB a reference to Tiddler Forbes.“However, I can’t recall the content of the article.“What stays with me is not just the name, what stays with me is the utmost conviction of the journeymen who declared Tiddler Forbes the greatest junior football player of their generation.”I also can’t recall the reference, so, is there a BwB reader with any information on Tiddler Forbes "},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-glasgows-queen-barras-five-facts-maggie-mciver","story":" Maggie McIver, Queen of the Barras, had her first taste of business when she looked after a family friendrsquos fruit barrow in Parkhead.

It should not have to house an energy transition zone at the expense of our green space.”However, the zone was backed by the Liberal Democrat group.Councillor Martin Greig said: “The ETZ is crucial to our economic future. This zone is part of our responsibility to try to develop future energy technology.”Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said the decision would create “a bright future for Aberdeen”.He added: “We are in danger of falling behind and need to embrace this for our young people.

They race because it provides them with the illusion of freedom. But they fall in love behind the wheel, meaning many of them never leave.“This is what happened to our protagonist Finnie and his we Katie. After  years of gutting fish, and with a son following in his footsteps, Finnie can no longer ignore the fact he’s going nowhere.“While the tension provoked by his son’s coming of age rises in Finnie, Katie tries to keep their relationship together. She knows what Finnie has yet to learn about the value of love.” vw, px\"  Run will be released in UK cinemas on March  and is the third feature- film based in the north-east written and directed by Mr Graham, following Iona and Shell.Mr Graham added: “Run is the last of three films about a conflict between a parent and child and the place they call home.“Unlike Shell and Iona, my new film is about the hope that can be found in the ties that bind you to your family and your community.“With this film I have tried to reimagine Springsteen’s songs about families who can’t communicate and history repeating itself as something ultimately uplting. I wanted to show that these themes, expressed so well in American music, literature and film, are as much a part of le in the north-east of Scotland as they are the American Mid-west,” he said.“Run is a film that celebrates falling in love in your teens, evenit means you never leave your home town.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.48791421-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.48791421-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.48791421-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.48791421-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"sids plea to trace long lost love met with huge response from aberdeen locals","story":"A plea to find a long-lost lover of a Norfolk deep sea er has garnered a massive response from helpful locals.Sid Johnson wants to trace Lilias Morganto leave her money in his will.Lilias lived in the Ferryhill area around .Following his trip to the Granite City last week, he has ed home to Norwich empty-handed.However, after the article was published yesterday and online, there has been a huge response from readers touched by his story.So far, there have been more than  emails and social media messages with potential leads sent in.Sid is absolutely thrilled with this response and has thanked everyone for their help.He said: “I didn’t think my story would be spread this wide and I want to say thank you to everyone who has been in touch so far.“It is something I’ve always wanted to sort out and the time is now right to do this.“Everyone up in Aberdeen has been so great and kind with me.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e57692b504fd5.70489191-848x564.jpg ","title":"stepping out on road to 1m with aberdeen kiltwalk","story":"Thousands of people across the north-east will be donning their kilts as part of a popular national charity walk.Kiltwalk, the fth largest fundraising event in the UK, is set toto Aberdeen with some big changes.Now in its th year, the event is backed by celebrities including Scots funnyman Kevin Bridges – who showed his support by sharing a now viral video, urging the public to get on board and “cut aboot in a kilt”. vw, px\"  The Hunter Foundation, which has financially supported the kiltwalk since , pledged to increase its contribution this year.The venture provides a % top up on all funds raised through the charity event, but announced in January that it would be providing a % boost for this year.Every £ raised becomes £., with % of funds going to the charities chosen by the “kiltwalk heroes”, meaning Aberdeen is expected to smash the £ million mark in a single day.Philanthropist Tom Hunter said: “Kiltwalk is the lowest cost  in Scotland for charity fundraisers to walk for what they care about.“We hope our % top-up will help them along the way.“I’d like to thank each and every person who takes part in our Kiltwalk events.“We’ve seen just what impact it can have – from a young walker in Dundee raising £ for the Sea Cadets to the biggest charities raising hundreds of thousands of pounds.“Everyone is making a big dference all over Scotland, so we’ve decided to ‘up the ante’ and boost their fundraising with a % top-up.” vw, px\"  Comprised of three dferent walks of ying s – The Mighty Stride, The Big Stroll and The Wee Wander – there is a Kiltwalk designed for everyone to take part in this summer.Last year, a total of  charities in Aberdeen and the surrounding areas benefitted from the event, which takes place in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee.Paul Cooney, Kiltwalk CEO, said: “We’re counting down the hundred days until the Aberdeen Kiltwalk.“Last year , big-hearted Kiltwalkers supported their causes raising £,.“With the brilliant news that Sir Tom Hunter is uplting the Kiltwalk top-up to % this year, we are on track to smash £ million for charities in the north-east.“I hope you can join us on the June  for a great day at Kiltwalk .” vw, px\"  Kiltwalk  is set toacross four cities this year.The popular charity event, which has been held since , sees thousands of people put on a kilt and a smile in aid of their favourite cause.With locations across Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, many choose to take on one walk or a ‘grand slam’ of all four.Aberdeen Kiltwalk takes place on Sunday June , with the ultimate challenge of the -mile Mighty Stride beginning at am from Potarch Green.The route moves through the stunning Blackhall forest, before following the Deeside Way through King George V Park in Banchory.The Big Stroll is  miles between Crathes Castle and the combined end point, Duthie Park, where there is food and entertainment.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour.

The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road .

An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield stands has been supported by two Scottish rugby legends.Former Melrose

the style of sculpture has a isive effect on opinion, the statue has and continues to attract visitors to the Borders.Isabel Hay from the William Wallace Society believes more should be done to

He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do this for up to  days to help reduce the possible spread of infection.What are the symptoms of coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, with the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionexplaining they usually cause ldquomild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold.This particular strain originated in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, the largest city in central China, and is in the same family as SARS and MERS .The symptoms of coronavirus are:a cougha high temperatureshortness of breathBut these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-self-isolation---can-affect-rights-pay-work","story":"UPuntil a week ago many of us had probably never heard the term lsquoself-isolationrsquo.But now not a day goes by without us being aware of people who have been asked or chosen to isolate themselves in order to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid statutory sick pay while Irsquom away from work Onlyyou are medically unfit for work and meet the eligibility criteria for Statutory Sick Pay.Will my pay be affectedI have to stay at home due to my childrsquos school being closed You have the right to reasonable time off to deal with unexpected disruptions relating to the care of your child this includes incidents relating to your childrsquos school.You must noty your employer as soon as possible and advise, where practicable, how long the disruption is likely to last.This time off is unpaid but you may request to use this time as paid annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period

And the results scar Londonrsquos skyline today.The PM ldquodidnrsquot care about social or genuinely affordable housing and ldquoran roughshod over communities in bulldozing estates, Mr Khan added.ldquoHe did nothing to help renters and rents skyrocketed on his watch and shamefully rough sleeping more than doubled during his time as mayor, the mayor continued.London is in the middle of a housing crisis with private renters suffering from sky high rents and the threat of eviction.Join @SadiqKhanand tell the Tory Government to give London the power it needs to introduce rent controls. # https:t.co laqbtdKpic QLlgSdmnXRmdash London LabourMarch , ldquoItrsquos simply impossible to undo this damaging legacy overnight, itrsquos going to be a marathon not a sprint.City Hall does not have the powers to introduce rent controls and would need to be devolved from central Government.But Mr Khan was claiming his victory after putting rent controls ldquofront and centre in the campaign would mean the Prime Minister could not ignore the ldquoclear and compelling mandate to grant the power.ldquoThe Prime Minister will have to give us the powers becausehe declines to do so he will be denying the democratic will of millions of Londoners who are crying out for help, he told supporters in a swipe at the key Brexit campaigner.vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Khan has criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos record when he was Londonrsquos mayor ldquoAnd as wersquove all heard Boris Johnson repeatedly say himself the democratic will of the people must be respected.Under his proposals, Mr Khan would establish a ldquoLondon private rent commission, with renters on its board, to enforce measures controlling rents as prices spiral in the capital.Mr Khan was not saying how the scheme would work, but his team pointed towards cities including New York and Berlin which have some controls on rent.Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey accused the mayor of ldquochasing quick headlines rather than ldquodoing his day job.vw,vw,px, px\"Shaun Bailey is the Conservativesrsquo candidate for mayor ldquoThis idea has failed around the world where it has been tried, leading to higher rents and longer waiting lists, Mr Bailey said.But Amina Gichinga from the London Renters Union campaign welcomed the plan as having the ability to ldquotransform the housing system.ldquoRent controls are urgently needed to help end the way that sky-high rents are driving people out from their communities and into poverty, she said.Mr Khan snubbed rival Rory Stewart in billing the election as a ldquotwo horse race between himself and Mr Bailey, who he also launched a scathing attack on.Askedhe was running scared of the former Tory cabinet minister who is now running as an independent, Mr Khan indicated internal polling was backing up his claim.ldquoIrsquom quite clear based upon my experience on London elections as well as the polls that itrsquos a two horse race, he added.Mr Khan, the former MP for Tooting who was elected mayor in , is also facing challenges from the Liberal Democratsrsquo Siobhan Benita and Green Party co-leader Sian Berry.Ms Benita said there ldquois little evidence that rent controls work, as she vowed to build ldquotruly affordable rental homes controlled by City Hallshe won..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Khan puts rent controls at centre of London mayor re-election campaign"},{"url":null,"title":"grab-boarding-passes-set-sail-anything-goes","story":"ITS smooth sailing for the cast of Galashiels Amateur Operatic Societys production of Anything Goes.The Volunteer Hall was filled with s glamour as Cole Porters classic musical was brought to le aboard the S.S.

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo. Beria is trying tae stop spring and the rule orsquo Queen Bride. And we still hae the three days orsquo snaw tae come, but ater that Beria will huv tae flee.ldquoWhy didnrsquot they kill Beria, then itrsquoll be summer all the time  asked one of the older children.The gran smiled. ldquoAngus was Beriarsquos son. They were all related, just like the seasons, although they fought each other for a place they all needed each other and were part of the same family.ldquoJust like us.ldquoAye.ldquoGran, can we have more hot chocolate and can you tell us the other stories about Beria  asked a grandchild.ldquoOrsquo course, said the gran, ldquobut we wud need a hale winter tae tell arsquo the stories aboot her.

council says the hall costs over pound, a year to maintain, claiming pound, of that is caused by cleaning costs while it only receives an income of pound from the Scouts to use it.Scout leader Sam

Our system prevents that methane going into the atmosphere so itrsquos having a positive effect.ldquoWe were the first in Scotland to go down that road and recently the Scottish government is seeing the benefit of district heating networks as a weapon in the fight against climate change, one which will help to achieve its decarbonisation targets.PIONEERING: Derek Leask of Shetland Heat Energy and Power Ltd .He thinks that other regions in the UK might be surprised at the degree of innovation that has been put into practice in a relatively remote island community. In  the new Anderson High School and its halls of residence began to take advantage of the system and before electricity companies began installing smart meters SHEAP had already introduced a radio system that could transmit its customersrsquo meter readings.There are other beneficiaries of the ERP. Close neighbor Orkney does not have a similar incinerator. ldquoShetland Islands Council has an arrangement with Orkney that means we are able to take all their organic waste and use it for the district hearing scheme ndash which effectively allows us to provide an environmentally positive and affordable outcome for their waste management and is an additional benefit, says Leask.SHEAP is run as a commercial operation but any profits generated go to help Shetland Charitable Trust and its subsidiaries that focus on arts, heritage and recreation.SHEAP has some  domestic and  non-domestic customers, which include hospitals, businesses and council buildings taking in around  people. However, there are challenges that Leask would still like to resolve. ldquoWe have a waiting list of  people looking to connect inidually to the system and while there are loan and grant schemes that allow domestic customers in Scotland to have new, more efficient, fossil fuel heating systems installed, that type of funding hasnrsquot been available for connecting to our system so far. This seems a bit of an anomaly with the government targets on climate change.ldquoWersquore currently in discussion about how that could be changed especially given the growing acceptance and acknowledgement that district heating networks represent a positive way to help in the decarbonisation of domestic and business heating and it would make sense for the public to have access to the same degree of funding to enable connection to our distribution network which has much less environmental impactldquoWe also believe that heating networks such as ours should be included on the renewable heat incentive scheme. This would increase its attraction to customers and allow for further expansion. We feel that waste-to-energy schemes are having at least the same positive environmental impact as many dferent types of renewable energy which are currently subsidised with RHI, and probably more so in some cases.With the ability to reach a large mass of customers, we can intervene in high carbon energy use much quicker than the development of some of the new alternative renewable projects.SHEAP is not standing still either. Upcoming planned improvements to the Energy Recovery Plant will result in more energy being produced and the company is actively looking at technical solutions to allow this to be utilised. Plans are underway by the local housing association to build up to  residential units in Lerwick, many of which will be for social housing. These are the customers SHEAP wants to reach and discussions are underway on how to extend the network to provide energy to this development. Other initiatives include a project to take waste heat from the Lerwick electrical power station.Leask concludes: ldquoThe world is basically in a climate emergency. We understand operations like district heating can go a long way to helping with the decarbonisation of Scotlandrsquos energy provision. Wersquore keen to remain at the forefront of this and are continually looking at ways of expanding the Lerwick district heating scheme, making it more efficient and playing our role in reducing emissions from energy in Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11098242.jpg?type=article-full","title":"stirling-marathon-organisers-confirm-record-prize-money-race-winners","story":"Thousands of runners at every fitness level will take to the picturesque roads in and around the city for the two-day running festival in October.The spectacular route takes in some of Scotlandrsquos most iconic sights and stunning countryside ndash from the unmistakable Stirling Castle and Wallace Monument, to the picturesque towns and villages of Doune, Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.:Scenic Stirling marathon s in new guiseThe event caters for shorter distances too, with participants able to take on k and k courses, alongside a family mile and a half marathon at Kingrsquos Park.However race coordinators Classic Run Events say those at the top of the field will share a five-figure pot, with the winners of the menrsquos and womenrsquos races taking home pound, each - ten times the previous total.Classic Run Events director Steve Simpson said: ldquoWe want to attract a field of top-class runners and reward them accordingly.ldquoAlthough this is our first year in partnership with Stirling Council in running the Stirling Scottish Marathon, we took on board feedback from athletes about the level of last yearrsquos prizes.The route takes in iconic sites including the unmistakable Stirling Castle and Wallace Monument and the picturesque towns and villages of Doune, Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.ldquoThis is a substantial prize pot, one that is unrivalled in Scotland.

People can turn up, work and provide a passport of their EU driving licence and that will not have any implications for the rest of the UK.ldquoWe have another open border with the Republic of Ireland, and we operate a common travel area. There is no reason why that canrsquot happen with Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East added that the policy could create a ldquobig danger in terms of exploitation of workers.He explained: ldquo The big danger and potential cause of illegal work and trafficking iswe have a system in place where demand for workers is not being met.ldquoThat is the danger of what the UK government has announced in recent weeks.ldquoThe demand for people to work in agriculture or lower paid jobs is not going to be met now. there will be people willing to fill that gap through trafficking or exploitation, illegal working.The Fragomen report states ldquoany regional policy iations on the governmentrsquos proposed system would not open a ldquoback door for illegal immigration to other parts of the UK.It adds: ldquoWe reject arguments that free movement in Scotland, or perhaps any regional flexibilities, would create a back door to the wider UK labour market...The government is already relying on in-country controls to prevent any abuse, for instance right to work checks, whether relating to visa free travel from the US and where, or through the borderless common travel area with Ireland.ldquoThe government could rely on those same checks for migrants moving from Scottish free movement to a UK immigration system. Concerns that this will create a back door do not stack up, when the UKrsquos front door is wide open.It also suggests lowering the pound, salary threshold for workers coming to Scotland, creating a separate Migration Advisory Committee,three-year post-study work visas and waiving the fees for NHS visa applications.It comes after business leaders warned up to a fth of Scottish firms may be forced to close under the plans, while others said they were completely unprepared and had no clue how they would recruit enough staff.The agriculture, fishing, tourism and care sectors are thought to be worst affected by the proposals, as well as rural areas where, experts say, there are barely any jobs with salaries over the threshold required for a visa.A Home Office spokesman said: ldquoThe UK Points-Based Immigration System makes sure that everyone working in this country can prove that they have the right to be in the UK. This will help to identy iniduals being exploited and we remain absolutely committed disrupting criminal traffickers and unscrupulous employers.Our new Points-Based Immigration System will work in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom. The independent Migration Advisory Committee have recommended a single, less restrictive system to help attract the brightest and the best from around the globe.

As it is, the showrsquos run at the VIE Festival in Cesana in conjunction with their European partners, the Emilia Romagna Teatro Fondazione, had the plug pulled on it before anyone left Scotland.The postponement of The Metamorphosis is due to uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus threatening the globe, with the Italian government requesting the cancellation of all festivals in their country over the next few weeks as a precautionary measure.All of which seems a strangely fitting back-story to Lenton and Vanishing Pointrsquos new take on Franz Kafkarsquos seminal story about a young office worker, Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to discover himself transformed into a giant insect. For Lenton, itrsquos been a long time coming.ldquoWe talked about doing The Metamorphosis years ago, he says. ldquoId read it when I was younger, and I remember being weirdly underwhelmed by it. But we were talking to the Italian company who Irsquod worked with before on a version of  about doing something  with them, and I thought, with the atmosphere and darkness of it, Metamorphosis really should be my cup of tea.Lentonrsquos response to Kafkarsquos story when he re-read it was a completely dferent experience.ldquoIt made me think about what it must have been like to be Jewish in Germany before the Second World War, he says, ldquowhen gradually you realise that somethings happening thatrsquos not only alienating you from society, but is making you an object of persecution because you are what you are. People are moved from their homes into ghettos, and you get to the point of absolute horror and isolation, where you realise that there is no way out. Thatrsquos what Gregorrsquos journey is like, and I started to think about how easy it is for people to become alienated, but also, I became more interested in how easy it is for everyone  to alienate and marginalise someone because of the dferences of that person.ldquoThe interesting thing about The Metamorphosis for me isnt the fact that Gregorrsquos metamorphosis has happened at the beginning. The real metamorphosis is what happens to everybody  around him in response to it. Gregorrsquos an insect, and its not necessarily a problem at the beginning, He could be an insect that everyone cares for and goes, OK, thats dferent, lets try and deal with it, and be empathetic towards this thing.ldquoThat sort of happens at the beginning, then gradually it changes until everyones behaviour towards Gregor starts to become scarier, and gradually his world disappears and he ends up dying because of the way everyone  begins to treat him dferently. That incremental transformation is the thing thats really interesting, how people go, OK I can deal with this, theres no problem. But then, for one reason or another, your behaviour towards someone starts to change until you find ways of excusing your behaviour, and at its worst, persecuting people.There are clear references to the plight of refugees and asylum seekers here. This is likely to be heightened by having Gregor played by Italian actor Nico Guerzoni, whose dialogue in an otherwise English-speaking production will be in Italian. This should have dferent resonances depending on which country the show is being performed.ldquoWhen the family wake up and see Gregor, they see someone whos turned into a beetle, but they also see someone whos not from their country. In Italy, seeing the only actor speaking Italian gradually alienated by everybody  will be interesting, and here its going to be the opposite, with the only person who doesnt speak English being the outsider.In this sense, The Metamorphosis addresses Vanishing Pointrsquos very existence as an international company. As Lenton observes, ldquoDoing The Metamorphosis now comes at a fascinating time, because weve just come out of the European Union at a time time were collaborating with a company thats based in the European Union. So, for this show to happen, as well as this particular story to happen as an international co-production, and as a cultural collaboration, is really interesting. On one level, its very much about celebrating internationalism, but its also about exploring the tensions of internationalism.Coronavirus and Brexit aside, Lenton fully intends Vanishing Point to keep on evolving. ldquoIts always been really important to us that we that we work internationally, and that were an international company based in Scotland. And I really hope that that that wersquoll continue to be able to do that. Even though it becomes harder, and perhaps even because its harder, its an even better reason to try to celebrate internationalism, and hopefully not wake up one morning as a beetle. It always seems to be such a failure of the imagination to not be able to put yourself in the place of the other.Vanishing Pointrsquos production of The Metamorphosis opens at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, March -, then tours to the Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, April - Dundee Rep, April - Eden Court, Inverness, April -.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And the results scar Londonrsquos skyline today.The PM ldquodidnrsquot care about social or genuinely affordable housing and ldquoran roughshod over communities in bulldozing estates, Mr Khan added.ldquoHe did nothing to help renters and rents skyrocketed on his watch and shamefully rough sleeping more than doubled during his time as mayor, the mayor continued.London is in the middle of a housing crisis with private renters suffering from sky high rents and the threat of eviction.Join @SadiqKhan and tell the Tory Government to give London the power it needs to introduce rent controls. # https:t.co laqbtdK pic QLlgSdmnXRmdash London LabourMarch , ldquoItrsquos simply impossible to undo this damaging legacy overnight, itrsquos going to be a marathon not a sprint.City Hall does not have the powers to introduce rent controls and would need to be devolved from central Government.But Mr Khan was claiming his victory after putting rent controls ldquofront and centre in the campaign would mean the Prime Minister could not ignore the ldquoclear and compelling mandate to grant the power.ldquoThe Prime Minister will have to give us the powers becausehe declines to do so he will be denying the democratic will of millions of Londoners who are crying out for help, he told supporters in a swipe at the key Brexit campaigner. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Khan has criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos record when he was Londonrsquos mayor ldquoAnd as wersquove all heard Boris Johnson repeatedly say himself the democratic will of the people must be respected.Under his proposals, Mr Khan would establish a ldquoLondon private rent commission, with renters on its board, to enforce measures controlling rents as prices spiral in the capital.Mr Khan was not saying how the scheme would work, but his team pointed towards cities including New York and Berlin which have some controls on rent.Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey accused the mayor of ldquochasing quick headlines rather than ldquodoing his day job. vw,vw,px, px\"Shaun Bailey is the Conservativesrsquo candidate for mayor ldquoThis idea has failed around the world where it has been tried, leading to higher rents and longer waiting lists, Mr Bailey said.But Amina Gichinga from the London Renters Union campaign welcomed the plan as having the ability to ldquotransform the housing system.ldquoRent controls are urgently needed to help end the way that sky-high rents are driving people out from their communities and into poverty, she said.Mr Khan snubbed rival Rory Stewart in billing the election as a ldquotwo horse race between himself and Mr Bailey, who he also launched a scathing attack on.Askedhe was running scared of the former Tory cabinet minister who is now running as an independent, Mr Khan indicated internal polling was backing up his claim.ldquoIrsquom quite clear based upon my experience on London elections as well as the polls that itrsquos a two horse race, he added.Mr Khan, the former MP for Tooting who was elected mayor in , is also facing challenges from the Liberal Democratsrsquo Siobhan Benita and Green Party co-leader Sian Berry.Ms Benita said there ldquois little evidence that rent controls work, as she vowed to build ldquotruly affordable rental homes controlled by City Hallshe won.copy -.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door. Tickets are available from the Devenish reception or by contacting Danielmcginley@gmail.Alanna’s Hidden Hope will be available on iTunes, single priced at £..Proceeds raised on the night will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group and PIPS Charity.

Opening positions set out by the two sides ahead of the negotiations suggested there are major dferences on issues including fishing rights, Brussels# demands for a level playing field to ensure fair competition and the role of the European Court of Justice. At the European Commission#s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels, Mr Frost was joined by the UK#s ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow and a team of aides. Talks are expected to continue until Thursday, with a further set of negotiations planned in London later in March. The UK is refusing to extend talks beyond the end of the year and has warned it will walk away without a trade deal rather than see the process drag on. A high-level meeting to take stock of progress is scheduled for June, by which time it should be clear whether the Canada-style trade agreement sought by Mr Johnson is possible by the end of the year. The UK#s approach to negotiations states that the broad outline of a deal should be apparent by that point, which could then be finalised by September. If not, the Government will need to decide whether the UK#s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion. Michael Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for overseeing the UK#s exit from the EU, said Britain would not trade away its newly recovered sovereignty during the talks. French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin warned the Prime Minister that the tight December  deadline would not pressure the EU  into agreeing fresh terms. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said neither he nor his Scottish counterpart are considering checks on goods at ports.Last week, Tanaiste Simon Coveney warned that there would be a signicant impact on the trade negotiationsthe UK does not implement the requirements of the Northern Ireland protocol.He saidthere isn#t progress on the infrastructure needed to implement the Irish protocol as part of the Withdrawal Agreement in the next few months then I think that is going to be a very worrying signal for whether or not it is going to be possible to conclude something sensible before the end of the year.But Mr Poots yesterday told MLAs: In the infrastructure that is being sought by Simon Coveney, we are looking at tens of thousands of checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which will create a huge pressure on business.He added: I should say that neither the Northern Ireland minister nor, indeed, the Scottish minister have expressed that they are willing to accept any checks at any ports. Scotland was as firm as I was on that: we would not put infrastructure in our ports to facilitate that. If Mr Coveney had his way, there would be tens of thousands of checks, damaging those just-in-time goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That would be hugely detrimental to the shops, convenience stores and supermarkets that provide food that has been produced in Great Britain and comes to Northern Ireland. Again, that will have a huge impact on our consumers.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadUK and EU split on major issues as Brexit trade talks beginUK warned it can#t renege on Brexit Irish sea border agreementRevealed: The vital medicines that may be impossible to getUK crashes out of EuropeWhat has EU done for Northern Ireland  Interactive map details £million pumped in projects Who cares about border in Ireland so long as we are out of Europe  - Nelson McCausland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Here is what to look out for in Tuesday’s contests:– The statesFourteen states hold primaries on Super Tuesday, including Calornia and Texas, the two biggest delegate hauls of the entire primary season.Calornia offers  delegates and Texas . In total, more than , delegates will be up for grabs, about a third of the total available in the race to the Democratic presidential nomination.Although Super Tuesday was originally created as a regional primary featuring Southern states, it has morphed over the years. This year, it includes states from every region of the country.The other states are Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Vermont, Utah, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Oklahoma. Most of the Southern states are Republican strongholds in the general election, while others like Calornia are solidly Democratic. North Carolina is likely to be a battleground state in the general election.Polls close between pm and pm local time, depending on the state.– The votersThe Super Tuesday states are home to erse electorates, both when it comes to demographics and political ideology.In Calornia and Texas, white voters make up less than half the population. Latinos count for nearly % of the populations in both states. Calornia, meanwhile, has the nation’s highest Asian population, at roughly %.North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama and Arkansas have large populations of black voters, one of the Democratic Party’s core voting blocs.The states blend a mix of urban and rural voters, as well as Democrats from all sides of the political spectrum. As candidates focus on wooing Southern Democrats in states like Texas and Arkansas, they must also be thinking about a message that can resonate in progressive San Francisco. vw,vw,px, px\"Most of the Super Tuesday states have some form of widespread early voting. Voters in Minnesota, for example, could start casting ballots in January. Millions of mail-in ballots went out to Calornia voters on February , the day of the Iowa caucuses.– The candidatesVermont senator Bernie Sanders and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg have had the widest and most aggressive footprint across the Super Tuesday states, largely because they have the most money to spend.Mr Bloomberg is advertising in all  states, while Mr Sanders is on the airwaves in .It is the first time Mr Bloomberg will be on the ballot, after he skipped the first four voting states, making the day a critical test of his theory that he is the best candidate to stand against Mr Sanders and, later, Republican president Donald Trump. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Sanders spent Sunday in Calornia, holding rallies in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, the state’s major liberal strongholds.He is hoping his months-long focus on the state and his resonance with Latino voters will help him win a large chunk of the state’s  delegates. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren was in Calornia on Monday, and Joe Biden willon primary day.Mr Biden, for his part, hopes his strong showing in Saturday’s South Carolina primary is a harbinger of coming success with black voters, who dominate the Democratic electorate in a handful of Super Tuesday states.Mr Warren hopes to win her home-state primary, though Mr Sanders is making a play for it in what could prove to be a fatal blow to her campaign. Mr Bloomberg has also campaigned across the South in recent days as he tries to prove he can build a winning Democratic coalition.Democrats opposed to Mr Sanders are hoping to see voters coalesce behind a moderate alternative.

The Catholic Church has therefore taken the decision to “suspend” the Sign of Peace during religious services and advised that water fonts should not be used. Bishop McKeown said: “Most physical interaction during religious services, e.g. shaking hands while exchanging the ‘Sign of Peace’ in Christian religious services, involves a low risk of spreading the virus, especiallymembers of the congregation who are unwell do not attend religious services while they are ill. “However, because COVID- is a new disease that has not been seen in people before, we need to exercise extreme caution to limit the spread of the virus.” googletag.cmd.push Current information suggests that COVID- can spread easily between people and could be spread from an infected person even before they develop any symptoms. For these reasons the church has decided that physical interaction during religious services, including the Sign of Peace, should be suspended. He added: “The practice of shaking hands on greeting and departure at religious services gatherings should be suspended for both religious leaders clergy and laity. “Because COVID- is a new disease and appears to spread easily between people, we advise that holy water fonts should not be used. “Using communal vessels during religious services, e.g. drinking from the Chalice during Holy Communion in Christian services. To minimise the risk of spread of infection, the use of communal vessels should be suspended. googletag.cmd.push “For example, during Holy Communion in Christian religious services only the celebrant should drink from the Chalice. No one  should drink from the Chalice – this includes other priests, ministers of the Eucharist and members of the congregation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the beginning of February the Derry News reported that Derry City  Strabane District Council expected Stormont to announce poundm of City Deal match funding within weeks. A formal announcement has not yet been made. The council also indicated that negotiations were ongoing with the NI government to secure an additional poundm to match the total UK Governmentpackage of poundm towards a Derry City and Strabane Region Deal. Now, a Department of Finance spokesperson has said Sinn Feacutein minister Conor Murphy supports match funding. googletag.cmd.push The spokesperson stated: “The Minister will be taking a paper to the Executive seeking its agreement to match funding for City Deals. “As the Minister has expressed his support for Match Funding for Inclusive Future Funds this will also be included as a recommendation in the paper.” The current package, pound million for the City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund, aims to boost the economic potential of the city and support a more prosperous and united community. The Derry City and Strabane City Deal investment will help strengthen innovation and the digital potential of the city region and unlock local partner funding. googletag.cmd.push It will be bolstered by a poundm Inclusive Future Fund aimed at bringing greater prosperity and social benefits to the whole of the community. Ulster University will be granted poundm of the pound already committed. Official council documents indicate it may be given additional funds. UU’s poundm will be invested in centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation , the Graduate Entry Medical Schooland Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence . Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson has welcomed Finance Minister Conor Murphy’s support for Executive funding towards Derry’s pound million City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. She said: “Together, The City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund represent a pound million investment in the North West which will provide a major and much-needed economic boost to the entire region, helping us to create and sustain well-paying jobs and opportunities. “Derry’s City Deal was always contingent on the Executive match funding the British Government’s contribution, but the Executive must also decide whether to take a similar approach to the Future Fund. “Therefore, I very much welcome that Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy has now confirmed in an Assembly answer to me that he supports match-funding both and will shortly be bringing the matter to the Executive. “That is another example of the positive approach that Sinn Feacutein takes to government, helping to deliver investment, regeneration and opportunity where it is needed.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin was speaking after details were published of locations visited by potential inward investors to Northern Ireland hosted by Invest NI. In the   year, there were  visitsto Belfast, compared to just sixin the Foyle constituency and a meagre two visits in East Derry. Invest NI is Northern Irelands regional economic development agency. It is a non-departmental public body of the Department for the Economy . googletag.cmd.push According to its own website its role is to grow the local economy. “We do this by helping new and existing businesses to compete internationally, and by attracting new investment to Northern Ireland,” it adds. The agency has come in for harsh criticism from Derry representatives in recent weeks after attending a Derry City  Strabane District Council meeting where it was branded “Invest Belfast” and taken to task for failing to promote the North West to potential investors. Just days later, at a Department for the Economy Committee meeting with Invest NI, DUP MLA Christopher Stalford accused Sinead McLaughlin of engaging in the “politics of envy” when she insisted that a sub-regional strategy was needed to address “disparities” across the country. googletag.cmd.push Following the publication of statistics that show almost % of Invest NI visits are to Belfast locations, SDLP Economy Spokesperson Sinead McLaughlin MLA has sought an urgent meeting with Diane Dodds, Economy Minister. The Foyle MLA said: “The focus on Belfast from Invest NI will not be a surprise to many, but the statistics released recently are particularly damning, with almost % of potential investor visits limited to Belfast. “These statistics are only confirmation of what we already know and understand about where investment goes. “It is their mantra that they do not promote one place more over another. If Foreign Direct Investorsland in Belfast and are not taken anywhere  then it is indicative of only promoting one place.”  Skills deficit  Northern Ireland’s skills deficit, she says, is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – whereas areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of an NI Assembly briefing document has shown. Almost half the adult population of West Tyrone – % - have no qualications. Other areas with a high proportion of adults without qualications at level  or above include Mid-Ulster , Fermanagh and South Tyrone , Upper Bann , and Newry and Armagh . The Foyle MLA went on to say that sub-regional targets must be written into law and incentives put in place to ensure that investment is spread across the country. “If we keep on doing what we are doing we are going to get the same results, it is fundamentally wrong. People can’t keep on using the same old excuses for regional disparities. “Northern Ireland’s skills deficit is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – while the areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of official statistics reveals. “I have written to Minister Dodds to seek an urgent meeting where I will press for inclusion of sub regional investment targets in the new Economy Strategy.” Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson asked the Minister for the Economy whether she plans to set targets for Invest NI to ensure future jobs are located in Foyle. Diane Dodds, DUP MLA, said: “All targets within the extant Invest NI Business Strategy - are on a regional i.e. Northern Ireland wide basis. “Invest NI supports Councils to drive economic development in their area. Each Council has its own Community Plan, with targets for investment and growth. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has set a target of , jobs by . Invest NI’s support for businesses in the region will contribute towards this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

His performance will give manager Declan Devine something to think about ahead of this week’s game against Waterford, and Mallon admitted that the opportunity to prove himself on the pitch drives him every day.“In the first game I didn’t start but I kept my head,” he explained. “I’ve had times before, playing Us, when I haven’t been picked and I’ve thrown my head, but tonight was a chance to prove that I’ve changed and I’ve matured and that I am going to work hard every day. Decky put his faith in me and the goal was an unbelievable feeling.”Mallon was a threat for Derry City throughout Friday’s game and was involved in a fascinating battle with Bohs defender Michael Barker, a battle he eventually won.“I play to my strengths, I get the ball and knock it down the line and use my pace and get crosses in,” he explained. “I think he started to read that and that’s why, on the goal, I came inside to go back out. “It was an unbelievable feeling running over to the fans in the corner. My body was numb, it was an unreal feeling and to have my family in that corner as well was unbelievable.”The importance of getting the first win of the season was not lost on anyone at the club, but Mallon insists that neither he nor his team mates are getting carried away.“We’ve had two hard games,” he acknowledged. “We went to Dundalk and put in a good performance and were unlucky and Finn Harps I think we could have come away from that game with two more points, but it’s moments like this when you have to dig deep and keep on going. We always thought we could win this game, but it is only one game. We have four points on the board and we go into next week with the same attitude because we want to get another three points and get to the top end of the table.“The next game is a big game so hopefully we can go down there, give % and come away with the three points. googletag.cmd.push ‘No pats on the back’Meanwhile, Declan Devine has got one of his pre-season wishes as his team beat one of the top three at last, but he is not celebrating too much.“I want to beat them again,” he stated. “There’s no pats on the back. We’ve done it once, we have to play them another three times, we have to play Dundalk another three times and we have to play Shamrock Rovers four times. “It’s a good start doing that but for me this was all about character. “The boys took a few digs last week, with a few people saying things that I felt hard done by, but that’s the nature of it. We have to remember that when we came into this club they were th in the league having lost  league games, the crowds were down to - people. “People quickly forget, but we have to understand that this is the nature of the job. “The support we received was honestly unreal the singing and the backing the players received, that’s everything, that was important as the performance on the pitch.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City were left frustrated against Bohs continuously last season, picking up three points from four games against the Dubliners, with just one goal scored in the process. City have matched that points tally and bettered their goalalready and Devine insisted the points went to the better team.“Bohs are a very good side and let’s be honest, they’ve played three games in a week and we’ve played two and that’s not taking away anything from us,” he said. “Fair play to them, they came here and had a right good go, but I thought we were the dominant side, thought we were very much the team in control of the game and I think the players deserve huge credit again because they showed brilliant character and a desire to win the match.”The Candystripes are making a habit of scoring late goals, with Adam Liddle’s th minute goal against Finn Harps last week followed by Figueira’s nd minute strike on Friday. Derry City just keep going…“We have to. We have to,” Devine insisted. “The game lasts that long. These players worked extremely hard in pre-season and their fitness levels are really high. “The importance of the squad was shown again in the three guys who came on and had a huge impact. “We have a lot of talented players but we have to fight and scrap for every point we earn in this league. It is a tough league, an unforgiving league and we have got to play when we have got the ball and dig deep when we don’t. All in all it was a good night but we have to try and get better and keep moving forward and keep having that same appetite every Friday night we play.” googletag.cmd.push Key MomentDanny Lupano’s acrobatic goal-line clearance was a key moment in the game, and played a pivotal part in City securing their first clean sheet of the season. “It was a key moment but there were a lot of key moments,” Devine stated. “We had a couple of free headers Ally has a free header, Eoin Toal has a free header, so it works both ways. Our own downfall was giving the chance away that Danny has cleared, and what a clearance. Character is everything, quality is everything and an ability for people to attack and run to the very end the players deserve huge credit for. “There were a lot of square pegs in round holes but ultimately we have done a job and that’s all it is. “The players have been magnicent, I keep saying that, and they have been since January . “They will continue to get better andthey keep showing the appetite and hunger then that’s all I can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead. This advantage was quickly cancelled out by Gallagher, but Down continued to press and further scores from Liam Kerr and Barry OrsquoHagan sent the home side into the break with a - to - lead.Down controlled play at the start of the second half and points from OrsquoHare and Quinn stretched their lead to four points.However, no sooner had the Down supporters started to relax as their side moved well clear, when Longford roared back with - without reply to take a shock - to - lead.Connerton rocked the boat when he goaled out of nothing and when Dessie Reynolds and Gallaghertagged on points, the visitors were suddenly in the driving seat.Down now faced an uphill task, but they refused to panic and with  minutes gone Liam Kerr started the fightback with a point from play.Barry OrsquoHagan converted a free and it was suddenly all square again, but the predatory Quinn pounced to give Down a - to - lead with five minutes remaining with a well-worked goal.A free from Daniel Mimnagh another rsquo from Collum saw Longford trail by a single point with only a matter of minutes left on the clock.Down really went for broke at this stage and they were rewarded when James Guinness showed his versatility with a cool finish when he put the home side into an unassailable - to - lead with the  minutes almost up.Longford never stopped trying, but all they had to show for their efforts was another Mimnagh point.Down take to the road again this weekend when they head to OrsquoConnor Park to take on Offaly on Sunday afternoon for another must win game.Down: R Burns, S Annett, P Murdock, R McAleenan, G Collins, D OrsquoHagan , B McArdle, J Flynn , D Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , K McKernan , L KerrD OrsquoHare , A Morgan, C Quinn .

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon.

The Minister will be aware of incidents in my own community. Why have the Government not yet proscribed these organisations, and what steps will they take to review the situation urgently And I asked Home Office ministers why we should trust them over deportation flights when there are serious unresolved concerns about the Windrush scandal and wider detention and deportation policies.I said: ldquoThe Minister is asking us to trust a Department and system that have had repeated and costly failures.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland.
