In 2018, 178mm fell. In 2019, only 127mm fell.So far in 2020, Wild says more than 500mm has fallen on the cattle and wheat property.Photographs Wild took in December 2019 and then again in March 2020 show the area escape from a moonscape of rocks, dust and dry creek beds.“It was probably the longest prolonged dry period in recorded history. We really did get to a dire situation with a lot of these townships looking at day zero and not knowing what was going to happen.”Merenele is now run by a caretaker with Benjamin’s father John, 71, and mother Vicky, 70, living in the nearby township of Warren.Benjamin Wild, an occupational therapist and poet, lives in Lismore, but goes back regularly to Merenele.“I had a really strong affinity with nature growing up,” Wild says. “I was very much attuned to it. I used to collect seeds and rocks and fill up my drawers with all the junk I found.”Benjamin was born and raised on the farm with his two older sisters Julia and Kate, and older brother Tom.“It was just a state of freedom but, on reflection, it’s growing up in a workplace. Mum and dad were always around and I’d be out shooting or doing farm work. It becomes ingrained in you.”In a good year, the farm now runs more than 400 Shorthorn Charolais cross cows but by December 2019 as Benjamin returned for Christmas, they had de-stocked to 50.He remembers taking a picture as he entered one of the property’s main grazing paddocks, with a cow in the foreground.“That was a horrible day – hot and windy. We were out feeding all day and it was filthy. It would blow a dog off a chain,” he says.“That day showed just how bad it could get. Dad has been out there all his life and it’s rare that the ground gets stripped back to the bone.”The farm faced a bill of about $10,000 every six weeks just to feed the cattle.“The biggest commitment is just keeping everything alive,” Benjamin says.Wild’s photographs show the paddocks returning to life, and the creeks and rivers of the property and other spots close by filling with rain.Marthaguy Creek that forms the eastern boundary of the property was a place Wild watched black cockatoos and water rats play. He doesn’t see those anymore.“The saddest thing has been the numbers of tree deaths over recent years. That stands out for me.”Wild says the region has always had variable weather – with cycles of wet and dry – but he feels something has changed.“I feel like a tourist in my own town because I go back and see these extreme changes. It would always get to 38 or 40 degrees (centigrade) in the late summer, but recently it’s been getting up into the 45s and 47s for extended periods.“I hear the climate change denial in people, and I ask them when was the last time the Arctic and Antarctic was melting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87cd5007fe7eeef5ad920b01c64ce91cca428606/138_846_6056_3634/master/6056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdca68c4ccc18e0a942c4b0a711dc9fe","title":"caring for the vulnerable of scarborough a photo essay","story":"Photojournalist  Gary Calton documents the lives of the residents and the dedication and compassion of the staff inside Saint Cecilia’s Nursing Home in the north of England, during the coronavirus pandemic.Simon Walls is perched on the edge of a set of cupboards by a large window, gently holding the hand of 90-year-old Lily Pettener. His tenderness belies his imposing six-foot frame and the care and compassion for the people he calls “family” is plain for all to see.Walls is clinical lead at Saint Cecilia’s Nursing Home in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. He is sitting in Lily’s room, wearing PPE, after she was nursed back to health after contracting Covid-19. She is one of 11 people who have taken up residency on the isolated “Covid floor” of Saint Cecilia’s.When I arrived I was met at a front door adorned with images of angels, unicorns and rainbows, seemingly drawn by the young relatives of residents. “Do you mind going around the back?” asks Anne Brand, the executive administrator from Saint Cecilia’s Care Group. No visitor has ventured through the front door for some time. As the pandemic lockdown came, all visits were suspended to protect the vulnerable.I’m met at the rear door by Walls (15 years of military service) with his imposing figure fully blocking the doorway. “I need to check your temperature first,” he says. “Thirty-six point eight, come in,” and I’m led into what would seem to be the service quarters of the Victorian building.The home, which specialises in the nursing care of people at high risk of “deterioration”, was originally the Dorchester Hotel. It’s close to Scarborough spa, which was the UK’s first seaside resort, and once an upmarket destination for wealthy London visitors. But it went into decline in the 1970s when package holidays drew the holidaymakers away to guaranteed sunnier climes.Mike Padgham, owner and manager director of Saint Cecilia’s Care Services, agreed to give me access to the home. He has been a prominent advocate for reform of the care sector for a number of years, calling for better pay and career recognition of the work done by staff within the sector. It has taken a number of weeks to gain access to the home as permission was needed from residents, their family and staff. My visit was registered with the Care Quality Commission and I was required to wear full PPE.I was quizzed on my health, my partner’s keyworkers’ role and asked to sign a declaration of health. The white PPE overalls covered me head to toe, I wore a face mask, face shield and protective gloves. It was as hot, uncomfortable, ungainly and impersonal as it gets.It’s just before lunch and the television is on. I’m spotted by cheery resident Angela Morgan, with team leader Corina Grigoruta, and she’s smiling for my camera. She has been a resident for the past six years. I may have been the first person outside of the care environment that she has seen for three months. The scene is heart-warming and it is hard to believe the devastation this pandemic has had on the care sector. The dedicated staff, until recently described and labelled as unskilled, are now seen as keyworkers.“It’s frustrating,” say Walls. “The staff have been amazing here. I have massive respect for the NHS but social care has been left out. The work has gone unrecognised for a long time.”The first two weeks of lockdown were particularly bad, he laments. We had one lady come in with no symptoms but then later died of Covid. Then, in the space of two weeks, 10 people died. “It was heart-breaking,” he says, recalling the time he came in to manage the last hours of a dying resident only for the resident in the next room to die shortly afterwards.“I would rather have been in Iraq,” he says. “It’s a situation you expected there, we had the training. We didn’t expect that in a care home. We couldn’t get a GP to come in. It was horrific. It was really hard for the staff to take.”Allan Booth is lying in his bed, eating his lunchtime dessert. Nearby there is a picture of him as the town crier and on his wall another of him with his contemporaries. He was known locally as Mr Scarborough for his services to the town. “I did it because I loved it,” he says. Thirty one years as town crier but also 19 years as the town’s Santa. Each Christmas, Scarborough’s Santa Claus would arrive by fishing boat into the harbour that Booth can see from the window of his room at St Cecilia’s. He didn’t like the water so much, so each year organised a stunt double to ride in the boat and, through the magic of Christmas, managed to switch positions, on dry land, before the young onlookers noticed. Booth liked to talk. Vera Lynn had died that day and as we departed, the 88-year-old serenaded us with a rendition of We’ll meet again.Sybil Thompson lay in her bed. Her beauty and poise undimmed by her fading years. Nursing assistant Kasia Kapuscinka was helping her with her medication and a drink of coconut milk. A photograph of the 97-year-old’s large, extended family peered down from the wall besides her bed, easy for her to see. Despite her frailty, her energy had no limits her laughter and joie de vivre filled the room.The light from the afternoon sun was shining down on her face. She had celebrated her 70th wedding anniversary with her husband, Robert, at the home. Until recently, he too was a resident in the room next door. A couple in love “till death do us part”.The word “family” crops up time and again. “Many families have been fantastic”, says Walls. “They’ve understood everything. Even donated money just to say thank you.”“They are like family” is a much-used phrase but it’s hard not to feel the pain, pressure and fatigue many of the care staff have undergone. Many residents have been in the home for a number of years. Their needs cared for on a daily basis, and bonds forged. Their history learnt and family relationships understood. Physically and emotionally, the lockdown has taken its toll on the country as a whole, but the work in care homes has long gone undervalued and underrepresented.Donna Henderson, registered manager: “We’ve been through a difficult time and it’s been tough for us all, but I have a great team and we’re getting through by supporting each other. Staff have done an amazing job at keeping morale high! We are all proud of how we’ve managed these unpredictable events.”Sarah Earp, head housekeeper: “I came to work here straight from school, aged 15. I’ve been here 22 years and now I’m the head of housekeeping. I make sure that we are fully stocked with PPE, make sure all the cleaning is done on schedule and up to date. We have a 24-hour cleaning schedule now, in line with Public Health England guidance. You do get bugs in the home, we have always managed to keep it to a minimum. To keep things at bay, sometimes we have to isolate residents. Regarding PPE, some people don’t understand the problem. We haven’t run out. It’s the price some people are expecting us to pay. I think it’s extortionate. We pay £1.30 a box for vinyl gloves, which is great. But recently, some suppliers have been trying to charge £16 a box. That’s where we need the help from government. We need them to stop putting the prices up.”Corina Grigoruta, team leader: “I came to the UK for a better future. This company gave me a chance that I didn’t have in Greece. They gave me the chance to develop my skills. I like to work with people. It is so nice to help people and make people happy every day. I think all of us were stressed at the beginning of lockdown. We need to take care of our mental health, too. We are a very good team. We helped the residents to be without stress and explained Covid-19. We protected them and ourselves, which is very important. I have two children and they are very proud of me. In the beginning, we understood that we should stay apart. I was worried for my family, too. I was isolated in my bedroom. It was alright. We could manage.”Jojo Wilson, healthcare assistant: “I started work on 4 March then, seven days later, the lockdown came. It is my first role in care and I love it. I’m kinda glad that I started when I did because you just had to get on with it. Everyone pulled together as a team the staff, management were amazing. It was scary because we didn’t know what was coming, whether we would lose people. Sadly, we did lose some people. But we needed to just get on with it, these people needed our help. I love the job. I want to be able to go on and get my NVQs and work my way up. There have been loads of highlights. There is a resident called Susan and on my birthday she gave me a card and wrote in it: ‘Thank you for everything that you do for me.’ I was like, ‘oh my God’. That’s so rewarding.”Anne Brand, executive administrator: “For me, the past few months have been a whirlwind, adapting to home working, Covid-19 taking over work and homelife, supporting frontline carers in our homes and the pressures of being a good parent and there for my family and to home school. All of this has been a challenge and there have been good days and bad days. I am immensely proud to work in social care. My daughter leaving me notes saying, ‘good job Mummy’ saying she is proud of me got me through when things were tough.”Graham Pryce, housekeeper: “I started in May 1989, I’ve been here 31 years. I work in house keeping and do the all the cleaning, polishing, dusting and washing up that needs to be done in the home. I’ve been tested twice and I’m all ok.”“We have had too many reviews with nothing done,” says Walls. “We don’t want to be another statistical promise.”“We are a forgotten bunch of guys that do an incredible job. It’s not an unskilled job. It’s a very skilled job. The staff here have been heroes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b908284adf429e17121688aec9ae6240d3f54c8c/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efe196cca75ea9a5e24be558240b2c3f","title":"george floyd tributes concert for plants 20 photographs of the week","story":"Black Lives Matter protests continue and Liverpool win the Premier League title – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f073d482f3485a37a00db6695629ad3a69f5b9/0_480_7108_4264/master/7108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57038a7c8aec4eb89997d44c3f4e00d5","title":"ashley dotty charles few moments compare to meeting oprah","story":"The rapper and radio presenter on the problem with online activism, the power of protest, and the moment Oprah squeezed her handAshley “Dotty” Charles is the host of BBC’s 1Xtra breakfast show. Charles, 32, grew up in south London with two brothers and a sister and began rapping at 13. After a brief spell in Los Angeles with her family as a teenager, Charles moved back to the UK, graduated from Kingston University and, in 2012, signed to Virgin Records – the first British female MC to sign a major label album deal in more than a decade. She now lives in Surrey with her wife and their three-year-old son, with another baby on the way. Her forthcoming debut book, Outraged: Why Everyone Is Shouting and No One Is Talking, is published by Bloomsbury.Your book is a swipe at the empty rhetoric of activism that only exists with a hashtag online. It’s timely now, but what prompted it?I was on holiday in Thailand when I checked my phone – I shouldn’t have – and landed on an online feeding frenzy, one of those occasional social media moments where everyone is shouting about the same thing. Wall-to-wall fury. The currency of outrage, to me, was so twisted that I ended up writing about it in the . The feedback was amazing and I felt I’d found my tribe. Book publishers got in touch after that.People have been out on the streets for Black Lives Matter even during a global pandemic. How does it feel to witness?This is such a powerful time. In the book, I talk about “clicktivism” – activism that lives and dies online and is of no consequence because it’s not mobilised. And I think, for the first time, a lot of the people protesting are 18- and 19-year-olds who haven’t engaged at this level before.Do you believe it is a pivotal moment, one that will have lasting effects?Absolutely. You’re seeing tangible change. Police departments in the US are being defunded. The revolution won’t happen online but the power of the internet can change everything. It’s the platform that triggers the dialogue and for young people who are going to shape the future, the ideas for them are sparked there. I don’t want to be hyperbolic about it but it does feel as though this is the moment. There is something in the air.Outrage feels positive in that context but, as you have observed, it’s become wildly overused too. Where Jamie Oliver’s “jerk rice” can provoke as much noise as genuine social injustice…I think we have to be really vigilant in our outrage. We need to realise what is and isn’t worth engaging in. I’m somebody who has also engaged in absolute shit online. We do it because there’s so much in the world that is just insurmountable. And it’s much easier to start slagging off Piers Morgan than it is, as an inidual, to start trying to deconstruct institutional racism. If we can exert that energy collectively on the bigger issues, and bring down the systems rather than the iniduals, we will, as we are seeing now with the Black Lives Matter movement, see real change.You spend a chapter speaking to and deconstructing Katie Hopkins. What did you learn, if anything?That we can suffocate purveyors of hate like Katie Hopkins by disengaging with them.How do we revalue outrage when it is the social currency of our press, politicians, and national debate?It’s so difficult. This book isn’t a manual. It’s not me saying these are the answers and this is what we need to do. For me personally, how I revalue my outrage is that I channel my responses. I’m so mindful of what does, and doesn’t warrant my engagement. I don’t think we realise how much of a toll it takes to be perpetually outraged. So often, we’ll see something awful, like a Daily Mail headline, whether it’s a misstep or a massive atrocity, and then we’ll retweet it and comment how awful this thing is, but you’ve now just shared it to your network. You’ve made it louder than it was a second ago.What has your lockdown been like?The first stage was quite nice, it felt like we were collectively taking a pause. We were having three elaborate meals a day, doing puzzles, we created an at-home nursery experience for our son… Now we’re just watching Netflix and trying to keep our kid out of the washing machine.You’ve smashed 1Xtra’s listening figures with the breakfast show. What’s the secret to your success? I don’t think there is a secret! Broadcasting is all about speaking to people and I think I’m fortunate to be able to have so many great conversations with listeners. There’s nothing I love more than fading up a caller and sharing the airwaves with someone who I might never have met otherwise. When someone from Bristol comes on air to tell you about an awful date they went on or a mother gets in touch to say their kids have ripped the curtains down… I love being invited into people’s lives, it’s a massive honour.Your career has gone to the next level in the phast couple of years. What have the “pinch me” moments been?There have been so many but few compare to meeting Oprah. I interviewed her for my show and was then invited to introduce her at a film premiere the next day.

Firms will be asked to contribute to furloughed workers’ wages from August, regardless of whether they operate in sectors of the economy that remain closed under government rules, before it closes entirely at the end of October.The intervention came as Labour, union bosses and business leaders pressure the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use his planned summer statement next month to extend support to prevent a looming jobs crisis from taking hold.The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, called on Sunak to continue paying higher wage subsidies to sectors of the economy hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis, such as hospitality and retail, where job losses are expected to rise most.Sunak is thought to favour easing lockdown restrictions to help firms reopen as the best means to combating unemployment. The chancellor could also announce VAT cuts and more tax breaks for companies to encourage them to retain staff or hire new workers.According to the foundation, lasting job losses will be most concentrated in hardest-hit sectors. During lockdown, it said workers in hospitality, non-food retail and arts, leisure and entertainment were more than twice as likely to suffer from changes to employment than the rest of the economy.Urging the government to mount a swift response to combat the highest unemployment since the early 1990s, Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain is slowly emerging from the lockdown that brought the economy to a halt and sent employment tumbling. But we are a long way off returning to business as usual, and its jobs crisis is far from over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a1f9c8bdbbbb30d4e8686ea03df9e9b7deda6d/0_107_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5967f8fd30291395bc85add64378c2f","title":"coronavirus shielder find consolation lockdown prospero tempest john sutherland","story":"As I reflect on the deaths of earlier Sutherlands, and the writers I’ve written books about, I find myself thinking of ProsperoNational hibernation the man called it. A refreshing winter snooze. For me what came to mind was not bears in the woods but imprisonment. “Lockdown” is jail jargon and it fitted.It was a version of the 19th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham’s theory that incarceration should be isolation (the “separate system”). Why? So that, alone with their thoughts, prisoners could reflect, repent and reform.Examples bear out Bentham’s thesis. In his two years of solitary confinement Oscar Wilde produced his confessional, De Profundis. Not a witticism in it, but much truth. In my three months of social isolation a few groan-inspiring things floated from the profundis to the surface of my mind.But one thought above all preoccupied me. Ancestry informs me that I have lived longer than any Sutherland as far back as records can reach – some nine generations.As someone whose career was teaching and learning from literature, I have lived longer than every author, bar one, I’ve written a book on: Thackeray (died aged 52), Dickens (58), Walter Scott (61), Charlotte Brontë (38), Jane Austen (41), Shakespeare (52), Orwell (46). The exception is Hardy, who walked on through his Wessex countryside, noticing things others didn’t to the age of 87.Question: how is it that I’m the Methuselah of Sutherlands? Answer: the NHS. It has been the extender of my days, from the tonsils it removed in 1947 to Mr Alistair Hunter who, seven months ago, nailed my shattered hip back together with three titanium screws.I’m not, as Leonard Cohen put it, “living on pills for which I thank God”. But a potful or two are keeping me in trim, for which I thank Aneurin Bevan. With luck and medication, self-care and a functioning brain I hope to attain my Hardy year. And more.I rejoice at that prospect. Why? Because I enjoy being alive: even if, like sobriety, it’s for one day at a time. It’s a gift none of the other Sutherlands before me have had.The catch (there’s always a catch) is a virus that, like some microscopic white shark, is hungry for old meat like mine.In mid-May the  had the eye-grabbing headline: “Pensioners 34 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than working age Brits, data shows”.Some weeks earlier the Sunday Times reported our Richelieu, Dominic Cummings, as saying about prospective Covid-19 casualty rates: “If that means some pensioners die, too bad.” Downing Street denied he’d said it.While the younger bears are gamboling in the woods, scooping up life’s honey, the old must take care. Care homes, statistics suggest, are best avoided. How then? I am advised to “shield”, keep my head in my shell, isolate with some minimal bubble socialising. Till when? Vaccine or virus extinction. Somewhere over the rainbow.What then to do in the meanwhile? Everlasting quarantine, the door opening twice a day to take the chamber pot out and put in the soup bowl in, would make death a merciful release. Shakespeare suggests a preferable answer.In the Tempest, Prospero makes his retirement speech, breaks his staff and delivers his final verdict on life as illusion. Without that illusion – “life lies” as Ibsen calls them – human society would deflate like a punctured balloon. But when you’re a certain age, you can’t puff the balloon any more. Or can’t be bothered.The formerly omnipotent Prospero makes way for the young – his 18-year-old daughter leading the way – to live their life lies. He will, he announces, “retire me to my Milan, where  Every third thought shall be my grave”.But what about the other two thoughts? I see Prospero keeping his distance in his hometown streets, enjoying the fraction left to him in age, relishing the moment, always reminding himself that there are fewer moments ahead than behind.

Those who have been judged clinically extremely vulnerable, including transplant recipients and those undergoing some cancer treatments, have spent months shut away. Now, with remarkably little scrutiny, they are being urged out of shielding.From 6 July, they will no longer be expected to distance themselves from those they live with. Adults who do not live with other adults will be able to form a support bubble with another household. They will be able to meet up to six other people if they maintain social distancing. From 1 August, they can go to work if they cannot work from home and their workplace is coronavirus-secure. Most of the 90,000 children will be able to go back to school. Many will be desperate to get out after so long behind closed doors. Isolation affects both physical and mental wellbeing. Charities agree that in a lot of cases the benefits will outweigh the risks of infection.Yet many are extremely anxious. While the government estimates that one in 1,700 people are now infected, compared with one in 500 people four weeks ago, the UK reported 186 deaths on Friday. Economics, rather than science, are driving decision-making. Other countries have taken a much more cautious approach.Those whose needs have been overlooked during lockdown can have little confidence that they will be addressed in relaxation. Some vulnerable people never made it on to the government’s shielding list. When universal credit was rightly increased there was no corresponding boost for disabled people on benefits such as the employment and support allowance.Moreover, people with entirely rational concerns about ending their isolation may nonetheless be forced to do so. Though some employers are making minimal efforts to adapt workplaces, and even the “Covid-secure” label is an aspiration rather than a guarantee, the extremely vulnerable will no longer be eligible for statutory sick pay while shielding. Free essential food box deliveries will stop the government says people can go to the shops, or still get priority delivery slots or supplies through the NHS volunteers scheme.Under these circumstances, as the chief executive of the MS Society has noted, the idea of returning to normal life feels more like a threat than an opportunity for some. Disability Rights UK put it more strongly: “People are being forced to choose between their life and their livelihood.”The pandemic has both highlighted and exacerbated the marginalisation of people with chronic illnesses or disabilities, and the outright discrimination which persists. People need to understand the degree of risk they face from coronavirus – but the stress on the underlying conditions of those who have died has at times carried an undeniable whiff of the idea that they were essentially doomed anyway, or even that their lives were worth less. Shockingly, GPs have issued do not resuscitate notices to people on the basis of their autism or learning disabilities, and to elderly people en masse.Shielders have been poorly served during lockdown, and must not be neglected now. Continuing financial and material support should be coupled with creative solutions: in Dublin, “cocooners” have been given a designated time to exercise in parks, with others asked to stay away. A civilised society should put those most at risk from coronavirus at the top of the agenda – not relegate them to an afterthought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

The central story here is that of Drew Dixon, an eloquent, intelligent and talented woman who gave up a stellar career in A\u0026ampR as a result of the systemic culture of sexual abuse within the hip-hop music industry. The stories of her treatment at the hands of Def Jam Recordings head Russell Simmons and others are harrowing the film lays bare the great personal cost she wrestles with in her decision to go public 20 years later. “I do not want to be radioactive,” she observes, adding that by naming her abusers, she would be inviting back into her life the very chaos that she has managed to leave behind.

City will face Real in their last-16 second leg during the end-of-season mini-tournament on 7 August and, having lost their Premier League title to Liverpool last Thursday, they are determined to hold on to the FA Cup.They took a significant step towards doing so yesterday when they booked a Cup semi-final date against Arsenal by beating Newcastle 2-0 at St James’ Park, and Guardiola is keen for his side to finish the season on a high. The tie with Arsenal will be on 18 or 19 July and the FA Cup final is scheduled for 1 August.He said: “We are delighted after the defeat against Chelsea to be in London again at Wembley. Always it’s an incredible trophy and it gives us an extra bonus. We spoke after what happened in the Premier League – we need two more victories to qualify for the Champions League. But we have two competitions we can win. We made the first step today. It will be good to arrive against Real Madrid in the best condition. To win this title would be the best way to prepare for Madrid.” City, who have already retained the League Cup, lead Real 2-1 from the away leg.City dominated on Tyneside but needed a gift from Fabian Schär to open the scoring. The defender needlessly pushed Gabriel Jesus inside the box to hand Kevin De Bruyne the chance to celebrate his 29th birthday with a 37th-minute penalty and he duly obliged.Despite their inferiority, Newcastle should have equalised, but the substitute Dwight Gayle fired over from point-blank range with 66 minutes gone and Raheem Sterling made him pay almost immediately with a neat finish to wrap up victory.Guardiola said: “It was a fantastic goal from Raheem. For the penalty, I didn’t see the review. Gabriel Jesus could have headed the ball and I think the opponent pushed him. De Bruyne is definitely reliable and hopefully he can carry on because we struggled a lot this season with this.”It proved a disappointing evening for Steve Bruce, who admitted his side’s first-half display had not been good enough. “When you’re playing against teams like this, you can’t make the type of mistake we have done for the penalty,” the Newcastle manager said. “Unfortunately, we gave a poor, poor penalty away.”“In the second half, we were much better and brighter and the big turning point – could we have made it a really good cup tie had we equalised? Who knows whether we would have been able to go on from there, but we were certainly better in the second half.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d3c9d1a18c6bf250d2d9f210f344ed55cfd673/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29270f612ae0c64ed88cbd4940b23d2","title":"real madrid la liga barcelona espanyol serie a milan roma","story":"Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema produced an audacious back-heel assist for Casemiro to score as they beat Eyol 1-0 away on Sunday to capitalise on Barcelona’s slip-up a day earlier and move two points clear at the top of La Liga.The Brazilian midfielder slid to the ground to guide the ball home on the stroke of half-time after being played in by a stroke of genius from Benzema, who dragged the ball through the legs of his marker to find his team-mate.Real held on to their slender lead for a fifth consecutive victory, which gives them a two-point cushion in the title race over Barça, who were held to a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo on Saturday. Eyol, playing their first game under the caretaker coach, Francisco Rufete, their fourth manager of a troubled campaign, remain rooted to the bottom of the table on 24 points, 10 away from escaping the relegation zone.Levante went into a four-goal lead against Real Betis, who scored two late goals while Gerardo Moreno’s fine volley completed a fine 2-0 victory for Villarreal over Valencia. Eibar were also victorious, seeing off Granada thanks to Pablo de Blasis and Kike.In Serie A, Bologna pushed Sampdoria deeper into trouble as they handed Claudio Ranieri’s side a third 2-1 defeat in eight days.Musa Barrow broke the deadlock for Bologna from a penalty in the 72nd minute and the Gambian set up the second for Riccardo Orsolini with a mazy run down the left three minutes later. Barrow then hit the post before Federico Bonazzoli headed one back for Sampdoria with two minutes left.Milan scored twice in the final 15 minutes to sink Roma 2-0 in a slow-paced game as the teams struggled in the San Siro heat. The match kicked off at 5.15pm local time with the temperature around 32C and although the pitch was almost entirely in the shade the conditions clearly affected the players.After an entirely forgettable first half, Milan finally stirred into life after the break as Hakan Çalhanoğlu and Lucas Paquetá forced saves from Antonio Mirante. The hosts broke through in the 76th minute when Franck Kessié’s shot was saved at close range by Mirante and the ball rebounded to Ante Rebic. His first shot struck the post but the ball came straight back to him and he scored at the second attempt.Calhanoglu converted a penalty in the 89th minute to give Milan their second straight win since the league’s restart.“The kick-off time made this a really tough match,” said the Milan coach, Stefano Pioli. “We were looking for a victory against one of the top sides and we got it on merit. This win gives us confidence for the future. We have to grit our teeth and try to finish the championship well.”Inter completed a dramatic turnaround at Parma, as Stefan de Vrij and Alessandro Bastoni struck in the last six minutes for the 10-man visitors and Luis Muriel scored twice as Atalanta won 3-2 at Udinese. There were six goals at Sassuolo, who earned a draw thanks to a last-minute Rogério strike against Hellas while Napoli eased to a 3-1 win over Spal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83706587003d8e89aaa21c38f7c9d5808223bfd1/0_227_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03e144ea8002fea65edf9047c7f9df08","title":"michel rosen the national health service saved my life when i had coronavirus","story":"The children’s author and poet, 74, talks about surviving coronavirus, enjoying getting older and moping all weekend when Arsenal loseI’m only alive because my wife and our friend who is a GP had a sense that I was on a downward spiral with coronavirus and got me to A\u0026ampE. But I’ve got no recall of being critically ill it because I was in an induced coma. I’m only finding out now how the NHS saved my life while I was in intensive care for nearly seven weeks.The NHS is an incredible feat of the imagination – complete strangers care for you and this means that it is social medicine and social health at its best.My earliest memory is sitting on a beach. I was two and a half. I can remember sitting there, with my legs apart, looking at the sand. It’s hot and I’m not very happy.I’m the child who came after. There was a baby who was born between me and my elder brother, and he died. I only found this out when I was 11. My mother was very protective of me. If my dad or my brother took the mickey out of me, she’d say: “Leave him alone, he’s tired.”I was a massively happy child. My brother and I were given a huge amount of freedom to go off and play outside. Yet my parents were also very concerned, some might say over-concerned – they poured over every detail of our lives, our homework, our hobbies and so on. I felt total unconditional love from both of them.The closest I ever came to death, before Covid-19, was when I was 17. I was walking along the wrong side of an unlit road and a car hit me, breaking my pelvis and my leg. A few inches to the left or right, I would have been a goner. I rolled into a ditch and the driver drove on. Later, he went to the police, who couldn’t find me. They were just about to leave when they heard me talking in the ditch. I was apparently wide awake, talking. But I’ve lost this from my memory. It’s completely gone.Most people would be surprised to learn how much a football match can matter to me. I can watch a match and feel my heartbeat racing. And if Arsenal lose, I can feel completely devastated. It’s pathetic – it can ruin a whole weekend. I’ve been arrested twice. Once was for demonstrating against the Vietnam War in 1968 and pushing against the police in front of the American Embassy. The second time was for occupying a hairdresser’s, because the hairdresser was operating a colour bar and refusing to cut black people’s hair. I was charged with obstruction and had to pay £2 fine.If I could go back in time, I’d visit the period between 1900 and 1914. There was a huge revolution then in ideas and thought around psychology, literature and art. Everyone thought they’d learned from the lessons of the terrible wars of the 19th century, that war in Europe could never happen again. I’d live in the optimism and excitement of that time, just before the First World War.I don’t mind getting older. I’m 74 now, and people keep discovering me, which is very nice. They go: “Oh my goodness, you do this or that, and you’re quite good at it.” I think to myself: “Well, I’ve been doing it for 50 years.” But I don’t say it. I keep schtum.Be curious is the best advice I’ve ever been given. It came from my dad. He also said: be bold. I think that was quite useful.My greatest regret is not recognising that my son had meningitis. I put him to bed with what I thought was a high temperature and flu. I didn’t know and couldn’t see that he had the beginnings of septicaemia. Then I went to bed. I was the only one in the house. I can still see that moment I said goodnight to him for the last time, I can see that just in front of me. These moments are split seconds. The fragility of life is recognisable in them.It helps me to think about my son’s death as something that happens to living people and things. I place it in that category, as part of the inevitable biology of us. My feelings about him, my sense of loss… I’ve separated them off.I cried when I was researching my book, The Missing – realising that if my French relatives had just had a few more hours, they would have got on the boat and been safe from the Nazis. I discovered that a teacher in the French village where my uncle Martin was arrested is taking children to a local museum, to show them pictures of Martin. The idea that I’ve contributed to a bit of Holocaust education in rural France is, I think, my greatest achievement.I get arrangementitis. It happens to me when I’ve got so many arrangements, so many timings, so many possibilities of trains and timetables. I can get overwhelmed by that. It’s not the rushing, so much as the thinking ahead about all the many things I’m doing over the next few days, and it just sort of piles up. It can make me feel weary, like I’ve got a mountain to climb. It gives me a funny kind of tired feeling just underneath my eyes.I am an optimist, definitely. There’s no point in pessimism, because all that happens is you feel pessimistic – and then you die. You’ve wasted your life. So you might as well be optimistic.These Are the Hands: Poems from the Heart of the NHS, foreword by Michael Rosen, is out now, £9.99 (all proceeds go to NHS Charities Covid-19 Urgent Appeal)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea5e3b2e130dfca30078e8e904e5796cecdf9e1/0_257_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71601378d99fb9aa1d59d55f0e5fd783","title":"peers call tougher regulation digital social media uk","story":"Misinformation ‘pandemic’ erodes trust in politics and institutions, warns Lords committeeMinisters are being urged to toughen up the regulation of digital and social media because “a pandemic of misinformation and disinformation” is eroding trust in politics and public institutions.A House of Lords committee on democracy and digital technologies, chaired by the film producer and Labour peer David Puttnam, has called on ministers to push ahead with the long-mooted online harms bill and to overhaul rules for online political advertising.The peers on the committee, which made the recommendations unanimously, argued that too much power had been given away to a “few unelected and unaccountable digital corporations”, such as Google and Facebook.The impact of this, including the spread of inaccurate news and a lack of effective regulation in political advertising, was having a significant impact on trust in politics and institutions more widely, Puttnam argued in his foreword to the report.“This is a virus that affects all of us in the UK – a pandemic of misinformation and disinformation,” he wrote. “If allowed to flourish, these counterfeit truths will result in the collapse of public trust, and without trust, democracy as we know it will simply decline into irrelevance. The situation is that serious.”Among the report’s key recommendations is the creation of a regulatory committee on political advertising, comprising experts from the Advertising Standards Authority, Electoral Commission, Ofcom and the UK Statistics Authority.This would develop a code of practice and system of sanctions for political advertising, to restrict “fundamentally inaccurate advertising during a parliamentary or mayoral election, or referendum”.In its response to the online harms white paper earlier this year, the government announced that Ofcom would be put in charge of regulating the internet, with executives at tech firms potentially facing fines or even prison sentences over “harmful and illegal content”.The Lords report said the bill setting out such measures “needs to happen and it needs to happen fast”, adding: “The necessary draft legislation must be laid before parliament for scrutiny without delay.”Other recommendations include the establishment of an “independent ombudsman for content moderation”, to which people can appeal over online content, and more digital media literacy programmes, both in schools and for adults.Speaking ahead of the report’s publication, Puttnam argued that the tech giants were not too big to fine or otherwise regulate, despite their vast wealth.“I think the greatest single sanction is reputational damage. Google, Facebook and all those companies are more affected by reputational damage than we might think. And I think they rather rely on trying to keep everything as suppressed as possible.”Puttnam called delays to the online harms bill “utterly remarkable”, saying previous culture secretaries had appeared more onboard with it.“When I first talked to Jeremy Wright about this – it’s now almost three years ago – he was passionate about it,” he said. “Karen Bradley as well. But somehow that passion has evaporated and I don’t think we, as a committee, were convinced that the government is prepared to move with the kind of speed or seriousness that we think we need.”The Electoral Commission said it supported the committee’s focus on improving public trust in online content. Louise Edwards, its director of regulation, said: “We know that digital political campaigning can be a force for good, but many voters are increasingly concerned about truth, transparency and the targeting of political advertisements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f6bf277254e4902df5bb46ede4f46f97f1fa23/0_50_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c75fc1bbbf8137a4a8eb66c848b7917b","title":"a new normal how has working from home been for you","story":"We’d like to hear from  readers for a video series about what’s next in the world of work In our video series, A new normal, we ask  readers what they want a future shaped by Covid-19 to look like.

That it would have been my first is for me is matter of some regret as I have spent a long career trying to shoot a mix of all things British, and in particular iconic British events. How I managed to miss this festival is almost beyond me, given its significance in the British social calendar. I do have an excuse though, as the last weekend of June is always the AGM of Magnum, the cooperative that I am a member of, and I always felt obliged and keen to attend.So for the 50th festival I had planned to go, but as we all know it was cancelled. However, I thought it would be interesting to tour the site just before the festival would have opened, to see how it looks.I am being taken around by John from the press office, and the first thing to remember is that this is a large, busy and working farm. I photograph Steven, the farm manager, cleaning his tractor, and there are nearby piles of manure, and in front of the skeleton of the Pyramid stage is a large herd of friesian cows where normally you would see many thousands of dancing, waving festivalgoers.The other first impression is that the site is huge. This will not be news to regular attendees, but to this Glasto virgin it amazing to see the scale of it all. We pass the staff canteen, which serves 20,000 meals a day we see assorted landmark sites like the Greenpeace boat and the stone circle. We visit a site called Permaculture, where John picks some raspberries: normally at this time of year it would be a thriving market garden.All around the site are remains of the assorted attractions waiting to be brought back to life in a year’s time. There is a sense of melancholy about the whole site.We go back to base and meet Emily, and a few moments later Michael comes by in his bright red Land Rover. He is a pretty nimble 85-year-old. I explain I have taken his photo a few times and say the last time was when he opened a summer fete at an old people’s home in nearby Shepton Mallet. He says: ‘That’s the sort of thing I do!’ I shoot their portrait in front of the door to one of the farm barns.The tour continues and I go to an area with dozens of skips and many refuse lorries, a reminder that at the festival peak this is a community of more than a quarter of a million people, with all the servicing this entails. There are piles of old oil barrels which are the litter bins, which are freshly painted every year but are now looking a bit sad. I go to the festival workshop barn, where Rob is employed year-round to build and maintain the festival infrastructure.I hope to be back next year, to see the real thing in full operation, but I am grateful to have had this chance to first see the lay of the land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecd4beae976d6cdedd2b846e0cf5cf3e6b1f79c/0_64_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3212df302b8a245869b2784b9ffd8492","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities. Looking back, he sees some signs of hope amid the devastation. But will the government change its approach for the impending Covid-19 economic crash?When George Osborne delivered his spending review in June 2010 it ushered in what would become a decade of austerity measures. As budgets were slashed for children’s centres, libraries, parks and welfare, they were accompanied with the phrase “we are all in this together”.   columnist John Harris has been touring the country for the entire decade, chronicling the devastation that those cuts have made in local communities for his award-winning series Anywhere But Westminster.

Now a new telescope could confirm their belief and change solar system scienceYou’d think that if you found the first evidence that a planet larger than the Earth was lurking unseen in the furthest reaches of our solar system, it would be a big moment. It would make you one of only a small handful of people in all of history to have discovered such a thing.But for astronomer Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, it was a much quieter affair. “It wasn’t like there was a eureka moment,” he says. “The evidence just built up slowly.”He’s a master of understatement. Ever since he and his collaborator Chad Trujillo of Northern Arizona University, first published their suspicions about the unseen planet in 2014, the evidence has only continued to grow. Yet when asked how convinced he is that the new world, which he calls Planet X (though many other astronomers call it Planet 9), is really out there, Sheppard will only say: “I think it’s more likely than unlikely to exist.”As for the rest of the astronomical community, in most quarters there is a palpable excitement about finding this world. Much of this excitement centres on the opening of a giant new survey telescope named after Vera C Rubin, the astronomer who, in the 1970s, discovered some of the first evidence for dark matter.Scheduled to begin its full survey of the sky in 2022, the Rubin observatory could find the planet outright or provide the clinching circumstantial evidence that it’s there.Discovery of the planet would be a triumph, but also a disaster for existing theory about how the solar system was created.“It would change everything we thought we knew about planet formation,” says Sheppard, in another characteristic understatement. In truth, no one has a clue how such a large planet could form that far from the sun.The distant solar system is a place of darkness and mystery. It encompasses an enormous volume of space that begins at the orbit of Neptune, some 30 times further from the sun than Earth, or 30 astronomical units (AU)the , and extends to about 100,000AU. That’s almost one-third of the distance from the sun to the next nearest star.It was in the inner regions of this volume that American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto in 1930. Although Pluto possessed just two-thirds of the diameter of our moon, it was originally classed as a planet.By the end of the century, however, telescopes were bigger and astronomers were beginning to find more tiny worlds beyond Neptune. They were all even smaller than Pluto until 2005, when Mike Brown from the California Institute of Technology discovered Eris. It was at least the same size as Pluto and probably bigger, so, if Pluto was a planet, so was Eris. Nasa hastily organised a press conference and announced the discovery of Planet 10.About a year later, the International Astronomical Union ruled that Pluto and Eris were effectively too small to be called planets and renamed them dwarf planets. So the solar system’s roll-call returned to eight: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. And a cottage industry of finding distant solar system objects really got going.The path towards Planet 9 began one night in 2012, when Sheppard and Trujillo were using the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory’s telescope in Chile. They were finding more and more distant objects, but one in particular stood out. Catalogued as 2012 VP113, they nicknamed it Biden after the US vice-president at the time (because of the letters VP in the catalogue designation). To their amazement, this far-flung world never came closer to the sun than about 80AU. At its furthest, Biden would reach 440AU into deep space, meaning that it followed a highly elliptical orbit. But that wasn’t the most remarkable thing about it.By some weird coincidence, its orbit appeared to be very similar to that of another distant world known as Sedna. This mini-world had been discovered in 2003 by Brown, Trujillo and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. It immediately stood out because of its highly elliptical orbit, which swings from 76AU to 937AU.“Objects like Sedna and 2012 VP113 can’t form on these eccentric orbits,” says Sheppard. Instead, computer simulations suggest that they form much closer and are then ejected by gravitational interactions with the larger planets. The truly odd thing, however, was that the two elongated orbits pointed in roughly the same direction.And the more Sheppard and Trujillo examined the other objects in their catch, the more they saw that those orbits were aligned, too. It was as if something was corralling those tiny worlds, like a sheepdog manoeuvring its flock. And the only thing they could think of that was capable of doing that was a much larger planet.Curiosity piqued, they did some calculations and discovered that the planet their results were hinting at had to be somewhere between two and 15 times more massive than Earth, on an orbit that lies on average somewhere between 250AU and 1500AU from the sun. Their results were published by the prestigious journal Nature in March 2014 and interest in Planet 9 began to sweep the astronomical world.The next big leap came in 2015 when Sheppard and Trujillo were among the scientists who discovered 2015 TG387. They nicknamed this one the Goblin. It’s the third most extreme object behind Sedna and Biden and it, too, lines up, reducing still further the idea that this alignment is a random coincidence.In 2016, Brown and his collaborator Konstantin Batygin, also of Caltech, published their own analysis of the data. Agreeing with Sheppard and Trujillo about the size and distance of the planet, they even suggested an area of sky where they thought it might be found.But not everyone is convinced.Pedro H Bernardinelli, a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, realised that Sheppard’s data wasn’t the only place one could look for distant worldlets. So he turned to some initial data from a cosmological survey that was designed to measure the way in which the universe is expanding by looking at far-away galaxies. He searched the data for the celestial equivalent of a photobomb, looking for distant solar system objects that just happened to get in the way of the camera. He found seven.At first sight, it looked as if these worldlets were also aligned as expected, but the more rigorously Bernardinelli analysed the data, the weaker he felt the alignment became. “We don’t think we see the signal in our data,” says Bernardinelli, although he admits the he can’t yet definitely rule out the planet and has yet to run the analysis on the full survey data. “Our answer might change the next time we do this,” he says.These days, Sheppard can regularly be found using Japan’s Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, patiently scouring the sky for more evidence of Planet 9, maybe even hoping that he sees the planet itself. The scale of the task is enormous. It really is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The planet – if it is even there – is very faint and the sky is very large. But help is on its way in the form of the Rubin observatory.Rubin is a monster that will devour the sky. Whereas most telescopes would take months or years to survey the whole sky, Rubin will do it in just three nights. Then do it again and again and again to see what’s changed and so catch the moving objects.Construction is nearing completion, and the telescope is set to open its giant eye for the first time later this year. Commissioning and tweaking will then take another couple of years.“That survey is going to change solar system science as we know it,” says Sheppard. And if Planet 9 is out there, Rubin should see it.“We can detect an Earth-mass planet at around 1000 AU,” says Meg Schwamb, of Queen’s University Belfast, who co-chairs the Rubin observatory’s solar system science collaboration. That puts Sheppard’s world easily within its sights. “If others haven’t seen Planet 9 before our survey starts then, I think, all eyes are on the Rubin observatory,” says Schwamb.Even if the telescope fails to see the planet directly, it will detect many more distant mini-worlds that can all be use to triangulate the planet’s position more precisely, thus helping to narrow the search area. And if Planet 9 really is out there, then the consequences will be huge. Astronomers think that the solar system formed in a disc of matter surrounding the sun. That matter condensed into smaller bodies, which then collided to form larger ones. At the end of this process, the planets were born. But the matter in this disc thins out further from the sun, meaning there is not enough raw material to form a large planet in the distant solar system.To rescue the standard theory, some suggest that Planet 9 was once destined to become a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn and so was forming alongside them. However, a gravitational interaction stunted its growth by hurling it out into the dark.But Jakub Scholtz of Durham University is sceptical. “It’s possible,” he says, “but it actually requires quite a lot of coincidences.” That’s because a single gravitational interaction can’t do the job. Instead, a series of interactions is needed to place it in an orbit that never brings it back to where it formed.Scholtz has a more exotic idea. Together with collaborator James Unwin, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, he has suggested that the object corralling these distant worldlets is not a long-lost planet but a black hole.If so, not even Rubin will be able to see it, because black holes emit no light whatsoever – they simply swallow light and anything else that happens to cross their path. It is a tantalising possibility because Scholtz’s black hole would have to be part of a long-suspected but never-proved population of black holes that were formed shortly after the formation of the universe.But for the time being, most other astronomers seem more than content with the idea that there’s a large planet out there in the darkness, just waiting to come into view in the next few years.And if Planet 9 really is there, then perhaps the first time Sheppard sees it through a telescope, he will finally experience something akin to a eureka moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e32ad6a9c080e341b7a07f4d31221f61822718/0_38_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd0fc58f648d2312c27a85c352d26f85","title":"black trans lives matter march in london in pictures","story":"Thousands of transgender people and supporters gathered in London to raise awareness about the discrimination and prejudices faced by the black transgender community.

Stidham appeared in three games last season, completing two passes for 14 yards with one interception.The NFL Network reported the contract is worth up to $7.5m, citing an informed source.“I’m as excited as I don’t what right now!!” Newton posted on Instagram. “All praise to God!! Dropping content tomorrow!! I hope you’re ready!! Let’sgoPats.”Newton, a former No 1 overall draft pick who turned 31 in May, had spent his entire nine-year professional career with the Carolina Panthers until he was released by the team in March after they signed Teddy Bridgewater to a three-year, $63m pact. He had one year remaining on a five-year, $103.8m contract, but the Panthers saved $19.1m under the salary cap by releasing him on 24 March.The Auburn product and Heisman trophy winner, who passed for 45 touchdowns and led Carolina to the Super Bowl during a scintillating 2015 campaign, has struggled with injuries in the years since, missing 14 games last season with a foot ailment and playing the final two games of 2018 with a torn rotator cuff that also required surgery.In nine years, he has completed 2,371 passes for 29,041 yards and 182 touchdowns with 108 interceptions.

That is why the actor turned politician is leading a push for the government to save the sector, which he said was weeks from oblivion.“I’ve worked in pretty much every theatre in the country, not once but on several occasions,” he said. “In 55 years of being a touring actor, you take it all in. But all these wonderful theatres, cultural centres, which bring the performing arts to the people – we are in danger of losing them, and we are in danger of losing them now.”Watling, who also worked as a director and theatre manager before becoming the MP for Clacton in 2017, has met Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, to make his case for an emergency rescue package.The government has published a “roadmap” to get theatres and other live venues running again after coronavirus, but it contained no promises of new money to tide the sector over.With even some larger venues such as the Theatre Royal Plymouth and Newcastle Theatre Royal planning likely wholesale redundancies, Watling argued a rescue plan was ideally needed within days rather than weeks.“We need an announcement of some serious support for the theatre sector,” said the MP, who has also written to Boris Johnson. “We just need to know that something’s coming so that people keep going through these very hard times. Because there are theatres closing.“A second thing we really need to know is a date, a plan for opening our theatres. If nothing is done by August, then the panto season goes. And, as we all know, the panto season is something that puts money into theatres and supports the rest of the arts.”Becoming a politician was something of a late career change for Watling, 67, who along with his theatre work is probably best known for a regular role in the 1980s BBC sitcom Bread, and is almost certainly the only politician to have to quit a touring production of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, to fight a byelection.Starting out as a child actor on the ITV police drama Gideon’s Way, Watling spent many school holidays on the road with his father, the actor Jack Watling. He later spent a period in the 70s and 80s running the tiny Frinton Summer Theatre, based in a hall just up the coast from Clacton, describing it as “a hand-to-mouth operation” even at the best of times.“You get out and sell the advertising in the programme, you put on the best plays you can for the money available,” he said. “And you pray that the audience is coming. It still has a very loyal audience, but it just will not survive without help.”It is, Watling noted, a long way from big London theatres: “I suspect the West End will survive. It’ll be impoverished, but it will come through. You have the Palladium with 2,000 seats. If you have 1,000 people, and you charge a little bit more – and they will pay in the West End – you can probably make it.”Watling is urging ministers to consider the long-term cultural impact of losing theatres like that in Frinton, where actors including Antony Sher made their debuts, as well as the economic boost from overseas cultural capital.“Under the late Derek Nimmo, I toured the world,” he said. “We played to packed houses everywhere we went, and they were looking at British theatre, British values. It’s extraordinarily valuable, much more valuable than £13.7bn it’s worth on paper.”Watling, who met Dowden on Wednesday, said he hoped ministers were listening: “People are beginning to understand just how valuable this is, and how how much in danger it is. And how historically important it is. Ever since the time of Shakespeare, we’ve been exporting the English language and English values across the world, through our theatre. And we’ve now come to a point where Rome is burned around us – the theatres are closing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad62b7e5808dc7a0aa0965d1a4c0e472a38471c/412_921_3645_2187/master/3645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15c5a4bccfe4aa443f189bbb62a5d321","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated dailyLockdown laughs: where to watch online comedyThe National Theatre at Home initiative has reached a huge global audience, with productions streamed for free online on Thursdays at 7pm and then available for seven days.

Dave Watts took this photograph of his daughter Minna, five, on the daily walk he and his wife, Frances, a landscape artist, have taken with their three young children. Watts and his family live on the edge of a town in Somerset, where he works as a commercial photographer, but when jobs dried up in April and the kids were home from school the days took on a less predictable, sometimes magical shape, one he has tried to capture.“There is a network of footpaths and we fell into doing the same route every day,” he says. “Probably about a mile and a half, always quite a leisurely pace. The children got into the habit of stopping in the same places to play. Because it was at the end of such a long dry spell, this place was dusty and Minna loved that she throws herself into being busy and messy.”In some ways, shrinking horizons have perhaps taken children across the country back in time a little – with not much traffic on the roads, and long days to fill.Watts started his career as a travel photographer based in London, before moving back to Somerset, near his childhood home, when his eldest child was born. The weeks of relative confinement have been a bittersweet time, he suggests – the fears and liberation of an empty schedule. The family has been sustained in part by Frances selling some work through the Artist Support Pledge. “To start with there was a lot of anxiety, with the pandemic and the lack of income, but then there were also these lovely sunny days outside with the kids,” Watts says. His pictures capture some of that contrast – the poignancy of living in the moment, and trying not to wonder what comes next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f126dba0bf7a79b63583395450bc207bf0500d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f81334029ec24320a4967f6d70f62d","title":"aunt jemima uncle ben racism advertising branding","story":"As brands like Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben face an overhaul, Jason Chambers sheds light on why it took so longHow do we make advertising and branding less racist? For Jason Chambers, an associate professor of advertising at the University of Illinois, this question has driven his life’s work.As reckonings around racism in the US grow, a new focus has emerged: decolonizing the American supermarket. Last week, a bevy of multinational food and drink conglomerates, including PepsiCo (which owns Aunt Jemima) and ConAgra Foods (which owns Mrs Butterworth’s), announced major changes to brands that many shoppers have long felt uncomfortable supporting. These include Aunt Jemima, who many have long argued is a racist “mammy figure”, the “happy black cook” figurehead on Uncle Ben’s rice (owned by Mars Inc), and the perceived racist packaging of Mrs Butterworth’s. Cream of Wheat has also announced a review of its mascot.But what about the other legacy entities in America popularized through harmful images? Land O’Lakes butter retired its indigenous maiden character in April, but will the Washington Redskins change their mascot? Here, Chambers, the author of Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry, addresses branding built on harmful stereotypes and what needs to happen next.What was your reaction to the news of Aunt Jemima changing its name and packaging? My immediate reaction was relief. It’s an absolute shame that it took them this long.The racist ideologies and caricatures embedded in Aunt Jemima have long been criticized. Why do you believe PepsiCo was so resistant to the change?Quite honestly, they’ve had the money and the brand visibility to withstand it. Until now. When you’re talking about changing a brand name or trade character, you’re talking about magnitudes of change. Things companies have spent decades and tens of millions of dollars establishing. So who wants to be the first person to walk into the room and say, ‘You know the decision I think you should make for social or humanistic reasons?’ Then, with this current movement, PepsiCo saw that maybe the brand wouldn’t withstand the current sociopolitical conversations happening.Did you think other brands, including Uncle Ben’s and Mrs Butterworth’s, would follow as quickly as they did?Once the biggest domino has fallen, the one that’s the most visible, people will then gradually move down the food chain and ask, “What other brands are conveying similar racist imagery?”Is there historical precedent when it comes to a high-selling brand making large-scale changes to become less “problematic”? The one my mind jumps back to immediately – when discussing parallels of trade characters – is the Frito Bandito character PepsiCo had from 1967 to 1971. Frito Bandito played into these stereotypes of a sombrero-wearing, Mexican cowboy who robbed people of their Fritos. Mexican American activists spoke out against Bandito and it took about four years for the character to finally be retired. There were some strong similarities between Frito Bandito and Aunt Jemima in that both were recognizable, popular, and a success in the eyes of the advertising and marketing sectors.Why does the food sector in particular have such a race problem?I call it “ethnicity as authenticity”. If you consider a stereotype as something being based in a perception such as “black people aren’t good at anything but music, cooking, and sports”, there is a certain authenticity that comes with that perception. So you take the myth of the south and the happy black woman cooking for the white family, and suddenly you have a product that gains more “authenticity” through that image and, as a result, sells more.Is there another product or brand that should be nervous right now? I hope a sports team like the Washington Redskins will stop standing behind a line like, “Well, this is what we’ve always been called.” That they look at these other brands and see they can withstand a name change. No one is going to forget you are based in Washington or what you’ve been named. But you can be called something else. My question is, why fight it any longer? Why not get on the right side of this discussion and be held up as an example of a company or organization that finally listened to consumers?Various brands have posted statements in support of Black Lives Matter. Do you view this as a positive development? I hope the words of these companies are matched by their deeds. And by that I mean doing more than donating money. It’s about opening up opportunities for recruitment, retention, promotion within the company and asking hard questions of yourself. Otherwise, the statements are just empty words. So if you post a statement, you better be prepared to make changes within your organization. Should black consumers be wary of Black Lives Matter being co-opted by brands in a similar fashion to Pride?I hope the movement stays organic to activists and the people who have been part of it from the very beginning. Having these companies join the conversation helps, in a way. It normalizes the argument of the movement. It shows we are united on this topic and that there is a problem regarding the problem of race and policing.But after posting a viral statement is when the hard work starts. When I tell you, OK, to change this, this is going to cost a lot of money and cause a cultural change and be a lot of hard work – now how do you feel about it? That’s when we’ll see if real change takes place or not.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b718b428d42e2d18402af01fcd4a4cd0937f8219/0_173_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e389cb34a35b742d341d6905cb695a2","title":"mississippi lawmakers to remove confederate emblem state flag","story":"Governor Tate Reeves has indicated he will sign the bill to replace the state flag and create a commission to design a new oneMississippi legislators have voted to replace the state flag, the last in the nation to feature the Confederate battle emblem, which has been condemned as racist. The state House and the Senate voted to remove the current flag on Sunday and create a commission that will design a new flag that cannot include the Confederate symbol and that must have the words “In God We Trust”. Mississippi governor Tate Reeves has signalled he will sign the measure in the coming days.The flag’s supporters have resisted efforts to change it for decades, but rapid developments in recent weeks have changed dynamics on this issue in the state, which has a long history of systemic racism and saw more lynchings of African Americans than any other state in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.The state House and Senate met Saturday and took a big step: by two-thirds margins, they suspended legislative deadlines so a flag bill could be filed. Spectators cheered as each chamber voted, and legislators seeking the change embraced each other.“There are economic issues. There are issues involving football or whatever,” said Delbert Hosemann, Republican lieutenant governor, on Saturday. “But this vote came from the heart. That makes it so much more important.”David Jordan, a Democratic senator who is African American, has pushed for decades to change the flag. He smiled broadly after Saturday’s vote and said, “This is such a metamorphosis.”On Sunday, the House passed the bill to change the flag with a vote of 91-23. The Senate followed that vote by approving the bill 37-14. The bill stipulates the current flag must be removed within 15 days of the vote.Mississippi has the last state flag with the Confederate battle emblem - a red field topped by a blue X with 13 white stars. The flag has been isive for generations. All of the state’s public universities have stopped flying it, as have a growing number of cities and counties.White supremacists in the Mississippi legislature set the state flag design in 1894 during backlash to the political power that African Americans gained after the civil war.In 2000, the Mississippi supreme court ruled that the flag lacked official status. State laws were updated in 1906, and portions dealing with the flag were not carried forward. Legislators set a flag election in 2001, and voters kept the rebel-themed design.Former Ole Miss basketball player Blake Hinson told his hometown Daytona Beach (Florida) News-Journal that the Mississippi flag played a part in his decision to transfer to Iowa State.“It was time to go and leave Ole Miss,” Hinson said. “I’m proud not to represent that flag anymore and to not be associated with anything representing the Confederacy.”Reeves said Saturday for the first time that he would sign a bill to change the flag if the Republican-controlled legislature sends him one.Reeves and many other politicians have said people should get to vote on a flag design in another statewide election. The new design – without the Confederate symbol – will be put on the ballot 3 November, but it will be the only choice.If a majority voting that day accept the new design, it will become the state flag. If a majority reject it, the commission will design a new flag using the same guidelines.“I understand many view the current flag as a symbol of heritage and southern pride,” tweeted the country music star Faith Hill, a Mississippi native, “but we have to realize that this flag is a direct symbol of terror for our black brothers and sisters.”Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa46964a5381954eb1d6962f5ecf28e84debbcbb/0_242_4824_2896/master/4824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b0c45ac7d269d3a0bda2bd0a57c0006","title":"coronavirus leicester england local lockdown","story":"Priti Patel confirms support is being provided to city after coronavirus flare-upsLeicester could be the first place in England to face local lockdown measures after a rise in coronavirus cases, as the home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed more support for the city.Around 650 people were found to have had the illness in the first two weeks of June, a quarter of all cases in the city so far. There have been outbreaks at food production facilities and five schools have closed.The Department of Health and Social Care has deployed four mobile testing units to the city and made thousands of home testing kits available. The local authority is asking people to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres and to wash their hands regularly.Asked on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show if Leicester would be the first place to have fresh measures applied, Patel said: “That is correct. We’ve seen flare-ups across the country in recent weeks. Just in the last three or four weeks in particular.“There was the example of a flare-up in one particular hospital over infection control. That is why we have a new mechanism, a joint biosecurity centre, which is very much geared up and is being developed to address local flare-ups.”“There will be support going into Leicester.”She said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had been in touch with cabinet ministers over the weekend to explain additional support on testing and more resources for the local authority.She said: “With local flare-ups it’s right that we have a localised solution in terms of infection control, social distancing, testing and many of the tools actually within the Public Health England space that will come together to control the virus and stop the spread.”The prime minister has said the government would pursue “whack-a-mole tactics” to try and curb the virus in specific places as the rest of the country comes out of lockdown.A report in the Sunday Times said the latest outbreak in Leicester followed reports of large crowds gathering outside takeaway restaurants.Prof Keith Neal, a professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said the messaging on local measures needed to be very clear.People “inside of the lockdown need to understand why they have been included”, he said, as well as the exact geographical boundaries if there is to be a distinction between a specific city and region.“Urban sprawl has allowed towns and cities to expand resulting in these areas often joining other areas who identify differently and do not see themselves as part of the expanding town or city,” he said.“Locking down at the regional level would be seen as unfair or worse as Leicester city has really very little to do with rural Lincolnshire. People do not identify with their regional boundaries and many would not actually know where they are.”Patel also took aim at the recent mass gatherings, including the Black Lives Matter demonstrations and celebrations for Liverpool FC wining the Premier League.

Anxious not to damage the building’s foundations, the French authorities called in an archaeologist, who inserted a camera through the stones in the walls.In his report, archaeologist Philippe Charlier confirmed Peniguet de Stoutz’s hypothesis: “The lower chapel contains four ossuaries made of wooden boxes, probably stretched out with leather, filled with human bones,” he wrote. “There is earth mixed with fragments of bones.”The discovery has deepened the mystery of what really happened to the remains of les guillotinés. The Chapelle Expiatoire was built in the early 19th century at the site of the old Madeleine cemetery, not far from the Place de la Révolution – now Place de la Concorde – where the guillotine was frequently used.The cemetery, closed in 1794 when it reportedly ran out of space, was one of four established in Paris to dispose of the victims of the guillotine.When Louis XVIII became king in 1814, he ordered the remains of his brother Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to be removed and interred at the Saint-Denis Basilica and commissioned the chapel in their memory.Peniguet de Stoutz has now requested further research at the Chapelle Expiatoire. “Until now, the chapel served only as a monument to the memory of the royal family, but we have just discovered that it is also a necropolis of the revolution,” he told Le Parisien."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14ec37f7738a049ba5ee2af044f76226d49680bb/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1526b42b6c3a03a7658a0b7f62b2bbc9","title":"just 6 of uk public want a return to pre pandemic economy","story":"Exclusive: Poll comes as 350 union, business and religious leaders issue call for fair and green recoveryThe former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the heads of the Trades Union Congress, Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce are among 350 influential figures wanting a “fairer and greener” economic rebuilding, and believe there is no going back to the past.Labour peer Lord Kerslake said: “As the country begins to emerge from the crisis, it is becoming clear that people want a better future, not simply to return to where we were before. As with big crises in the past – from wars to the Great Depression – it was universally agreed that there was no going back.“And so we have to ask deep questions about what kind of society and economy we now want to build. The moment we are in is a challenge to us all: to governments, businesses, civil society and citizens. But it is a challenge to which, together, we can rise and build something better.”The research, commissioned by the New Economics Foundation, was released at the launch of their “Build Back Better” campaign. Other signatories include David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the bishop of Dover, senior rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, and the heads of Oxfam, Shelter, Save the Children, the Trussell Trust, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Frances Morris, director of the Tate Modern, has also signed up in a personal capacity.The campaign is calling for an economic recovery that provides more funding for the NHS and social care, tackles inequality, creates good jobs, particularly for young people, and reduces the risk of future pandemics and climate emergencies.Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, said: “The crisis has revealed a number of harsh truths – that our health and social care services had been under-resourced, and that longstanding inequalities have left too many people vulnerable. But we have seen what can be achieved when we are faced with a crisis – government can spend wisely, at speed and at scale.”It comes as the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, directly challenged the prime minister on his pledge to spend billions on the country’s economic recovery, considering the scale of “inaction and broken promises” in the last 10 years of Conservative power.Starmer pointed out a raft of existing regional inequalities in spending per head for education and health in light of Johnson’s promise to “level up” the economy.Speaking ahead of the prime minister’s planned speech on the economic recovery on Tuesday, Starmer said: “For much of the country, the Tories’ record on building and investment has been a lost decade.“Much hyped plans such as the starter homes initiative – which built zero houses despite having £2.3bn allocated to it – barely made it beyond the press release. It’s been talk, talk, talk rather than build, build, build.“Our recovery from the coronavirus crisis needs to match the scale of the challenge. It must be built on solid foundations. It has to work for the whole country and end the deep injustices across the country.”Using Treasury figures, Labour poured more cold water on the pledged economic bounceback by highlighting the fact that seven of England’s nine regions had experienced a reduction in public capital investment per person over the past 10 years.In Yorkshire, the east Midlands and the south-west, investment per person is still less than half that of London. Labour also claimed that all regions had seen a decrease in both health and education investment per person."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/070586ca4b120914dd191ff99756c5cdf4c957d0/0_0_4949_2971/master/4949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=430ee82c1be6c045a772ae87cefcc2fa","title":"us health secretary window closing stop coronavirus cases pass 25m","story":"Alex Azar points to recent spike in infections, particularly in the south and says people have to ‘act responsibly’ in hot zonesUS health secretary Alex Azar has warned that “the window is closing” on the country’s chance to take action to effectively curb the coronavirus, as the number of confirmed cases surpassed 2.5m.The Health and Human Services secretary pointed to a recent surge in infections, particularly in the south and said people have “to act responsibly” by social distancing and wearing face masks especially “in these hot zones”.The fresh surge in Covid-19 cases has been most pronounced in a handful of southern and western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively, with the support of the Trump administration, despite warnings by health officials to wait to see a steady decline in cases. Texas and Florida were among the states that reversed course on parts of their reopening plans last week as cases continue to increase.Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press program on Sunday morning, Azar was asked by presenter Chuck Todd why the US was failing to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, especially when so many other countries seem to be succeeding.Azar acknowledged the US was “seeing surging in cases” and that the majority of those are among people under the age of 35, which means a “large number of those” will be asymptomatic, presenting a different challenge for authorities trying to get a grip on outbreaks.“This is a very serious situation,” Azar said, adding that “the window is closing” to stop the virus’s spread. “We have to act, and people as iniduals have to act responsibly. We need to social distance, we need to wear our face coverings.”Azar argued that the US is in a better position than two months ago in fighting the virus because it is conducting more testing and has therapeutics available to treat Covid-19. But he acknowledged that hospitalizations and deaths could increase in the next few weeks, because it is a lagging indicator.The Trump administration has long been criticized for its response to the coronavirus crisis, and the president has frequently been at odds with public health officials on the best course of action to curb the spread.New York state, which was the center of the US outbreak through April and May, and enacted strict stay-at-home measures, reported its lowest number of Covid-19 fatalities on Sunday.Five people died from the coronavirus in the state on Saturday, a toll Governor Andrew Cuomo called “the lowest number we have had since this started.” During the peak of the pandemic in April, nearly 800 people were dying every day from coronavirus.“We are on the exact opposite end,” from states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, Cuomo said in an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press. The governor cautioned, however, that the numbers could spike again if New Yorkers let their guard down and fail to follow social distancing and mask-wearing requirements.“I’m now afraid of the spread coming from other states because we are one country and people travel,” Cuomo said. “I’m afraid the infection rate in the other states will come back to New York and raise that rate again.”House speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that it was “long overdue” for masks to be mandated across the country, but that opposition from Donald Trump had played a role in blocking such a step.“And my understanding, that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended the use of masks, but not to demand – required it, because they don’t want to offend the president,” she said on ABC’s This Week.“And the president should be an example. You know, real men wear masks. Be an example to the country and wear the mask… it’s not about protecting yourself. It’s about protecting others and their families.”Azar said Trump doesn’t have to follow his own administration’s guidance because as president he is tested regularly and is in “very different circumstances than the rest of us”.Democratic Washington Governor Jay Inslee told CBS that Trump should spend more time tweeting about wearing masks instead of defending monuments to Confederate generals. “We need a president who will care more about living Americans and less about dead Confederates,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6b05806b19f9a86076a10837380a4775503c90/2224_0_1927_1156/master/1927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f6f294a212d7c1f1cf284487124785b","title":"voters stay away from second round french local elections","story":"Socialist mayor retains capital, with Macron’s LREM losing out to the ecology partyFrance was swept by a green wave on Sunday as ecology candidates won a number of major victories in the country’s local elections.Early results suggested the biggest winners of the delayed vote would be the green party, Europe Ecologie Les Verts (EELV), while the election delivered the predicted blow to Emmanuel Macron’s La République en Marche (LREM) party, which has failed to take root locally since it was founded four years ago.In Paris, the current mayor and favourite, Anne Hidalgo – who has been engaged in a bitter three-way battle – emerged with a large majority, polling just under half the votes cast in the capital.Hidalgo, a Socialist, who is supported by EELV and the Communists, made tackling climate change and pollution the key element of her election programme. After her victory was announced, Hidalgo, in charge at City Hall for the last six years, said voters had chosen to make Paris more “ecological, social and humanist”.“You have chosen hope, teamwork, a Paris that can breathe, that is better to live in, shows more solidarity and that leaves nobody to fall by the wayside,” she said in a brief speech.In an election marked by the coronavirus, many people stayed away from polling stations, leading to an historic level of abstention.The first round took place on 15 March, two days before France went into a strict two-month coronavirus lockdown. The second round, due to be held the following Sunday, was postponed.At many Paris polling stations, protection methods including distancing marks on the ground and glass screens seemed hardly necessary given the trickle of voters. “It’s been like this all day,” said a security guard at one in the centre of the city. “Very quiet.”Lyon, France’s third largest city, changed colour, with the veteran former Socialist mayor Gérard Collomb, representing LREM, losing to the EELV candidate. Bordeaux, a bastion of the centre right, was also taken by the ecologists, as were Strasbourg, Besançon, Poitiers, Annecy and Tours.In Lille, the Socialist party’s Martine Aubrey, mayor since 2001 and daughter of the “father” of the EU, Jacques Delors, won after a neck-and-neck battle with the Green candidate by just 227 votes.Philippe will be waiting to hear if he will return to Le Havre sooner than expected after Macron carries out his predicted government reshuffle in the next week or so.In France’s southernmost city, Perpignan, the far-right candidate, Louis Aliot, a former partner of the Rassemblement National leader, Marine Le Pen, won in a major victory for the party.There was another shock in Saint-Denis, the Paris banlieue run by the Communist party for the best part of a century, which elected a Socialist mayor.Jérôme Fourquet of the pollsters Ifop said local elections were historically a way for the population to punish those in power. However, he said it would be difficult to interpret Sunday’s results because LREM, a fledgling party created to carry Macron to power in 2017, had few outgoing mayors. While Macron’s centrist party is dominating French politics at a national level, having fragmented the traditional right and left, it has little representation locally.“LREM will score badly because it has no outgoing mayors to lose, it has to win,” Fourquet said. “And most French mayors come from the traditional right and left. This means, in terms of sanctioning those in power, it will not be easy to read.”He added: “Nationally, there are two main forces in politics right now, the Rassemblement National and Macron. At a national level, Marine Le Pen is his main opponent. But these two forces are not present at a local level, where Les Républicains and the Parti Socialiste are most solid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213e726b4fff2655d78e36ab6c02c6b7ac7e420e/0_109_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c7e17d793430675d3e9f5ae1a1b579c","title":"china seals off more than 400000 in anxin county to tackle small covid 19 cluster","story":"Authorities prevent people leaving their homes in province surrounding Beijing in measures reminiscent of Wuhan restrictionsAuthorities have put almost half a million people in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, under lockdown as a fresh outbreak in the capital continues to fan fears of a second wave of the coronavirus.Anxin county, about 145km (90 miles) from Beijing, has “sealed off” residential areas and restricted people from leaving their homes. Only one person from each household can leave once a day with a special pass to get necessities such as food or medicine, according to the measures announced and put into immediate effect on Sunday.All other residents, aside from those who need medical help, are to stay at home until further notice, said local authorities. “Every village, neighbourhood and building must mobilise party members, volunteers, and staff” to join the “fight” against the outbreak, the notice said.Authorities also called on the county’s roughly 420,000 residents to “supervise each other and strictly comply with relevant requirements”. Those who did not obey the measures would face “severe treatment by public security according to the law”, it said. “Every single person has responsibility when combating the virus,” the notice said.The measures are similar to the stringent lockdowns imposed in Hubei province and other parts of the country at the height of the outbreak, when tens of millions of residents were ordered to stay home.Officials said Anxin was adopting stricter measures out of an abundance of caution, not because the outbreak there was severe. State media reported that there had been 12 confirmed cases in Anxin county, where businesses had supplied fish to the Xinfadi market – the centre of the new cluster of cases in Beijing. Eleven of the cases were linked to the market, according to the Global Times.More than 300 people have been diagnosed with the virus in Beijing since mid June when authorities discovered a new outbreak connected to the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food market in the south-east of the city. On Monday, China reported 12 new cases, seven of them in Beijing.Restrictions in Beijing have returned, with districts and companies requiring mass testing.

But it is very hard to make predictions in this space.”He suggested that similar numbers could be expected in the days to come.Victoria’s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said on Monday most cases were from hotspot suburbs in the city’s north and west.“Many of the cases that have come through today are overwhelmingly concentrated in those priority suburbs. We’ve got many cases across the inner northern suburbs and the western suburbs of Melbourne, but not exclusively.”At the height of the first wave, Victoria reached 111 new cases in a day, but a much smaller proportion contracted the disease locally.A week ago, Victoria was generally recording case numbers in the teens.Of Monday’s cases, 14 were connected to existing or new outbreaks, 37 were discovered in routine testing and 23 are still under investigation.Six previously reported cases were confirmed to have been contracted through community transmission where contact tracing could not establish the source of the infection.There were two new family outbreaks in Truganinna in Melbourne’s west, with five cases, and in the Patterson Lakes-Lysterfield area in Melbourne’s south-east, with four cases.The Stamford Plaza hotel cluster gained three cases, and the Wollert cluster grew by one. Four cases were added to the North Melbourne cluster, which has now been linked to the Brimbank family cluster. This is believed to bring the combined total of these outbreaks to 31.Monday marks day five of the 10-day testing blitz in Melbourne’s hotspot suburbs, with 15,000 tests conducted in the past 24 hours.Sutton said he would not announce the lockdown of any suburb on Monday, but it was still under consideration.Sutton suggested suburb lockdowns could cause infected people to travel into non-infected areas if they became frustrated with restrictions. “We don’t want to drive people out of suburban areas into new unaffected areas. So there is a balancing act in terms of making the call on a lockdown,” he said.“We know that it is a real challenge for businesses, it is a real challenge for people in their homes if that is what is required. But it is absolutely an option and we flagged the possibility of using it and we will use it if it is required,” he said.However, Sutton flagged that future lockdowns could be more household-focused than previous restrictions.“We have to think through what will make a difference in this current challenge … We know that transmission is occurring across households and it is people seeing too many others across too many vulnerable settings where transmission is occurring,” he said.“We know that for a lot of our settings, restaurants and other places that have really taken up the Covid-safe code, if you like, that the risk of transmission in those settings is well-managed, and so it may not look the same in terms of shutting down a lot of those settings because that is not where transmission is occurring.”Sutton said the numbers were “absolutely concerning” and indicated outbreaks occurring “across multiple households, across work and other settings”.He suggested people were still not heeding warnings to stay home if even slightly sick.“What we are seeing is transmission across settings because people are still going out with symptoms,” he saidMikakos also said a number of schools would be deep-cleaned, following staff or students testing positive.“The schools are Queen of Peace Parish primary in Altona, Aitken Hill primary school in Craigieburn, Maribyrnong College, Footscray high school, Port Phillip specialist school, Al-Taqwa College in Truganina,” she said.These schools did not need to be closed down, as the Victorian school holidays mean there is no one on campus this week, but students and staff may have been infectious in the last days of term two.A childcare centre in Abbotsford has been close for cleaning, and close contacts of a healthcare worker at the Melbourne Clinic in Richmond are being contacted after they tested positive to the virus.The Lifeblood Redcross processing facility will also be cleaned after a staff member contracted the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee7f66262579bd73e62eb3abc0305dd5d875c746/16_0_3928_2358/master/3928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0758343a018a321648328ac8ba6adb5b","title":"russian mining giant admits pumping wastewater into arctic tundra","story":"Norilsk Nickel suspends workers at metals plant who dumped the water in ‘flagrant violation of operating rules’A Russian mining giant said on Sunday it had suspended workers at a metals plant who were responsible for pumping wastewater into nearby Arctic tundra.Independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta published videos from the scene showing large metal pipes carrying wastewater from the reservoir and dumping foaming liquid among nearby trees.A source told Interfax news agency on Sunday that about 6,000 cubic metres of liquid used to process minerals at the facility had been dumped, and that the discharge had lasted “several hours”.It was impossible to determine how far the wastewater had dispersed, the source said.Norilsk Nickel cited a “flagrant violation of operating rules” in a statement announcing it had suspended employees responsible for dumping wastewater from a dangerously full reservoir into the natural environment.The incident occurred at the Talnakh enrichment plant near the Arctic city of Norilsk, the company said.It comes a month an unprecedented fuel leak at one of the company’s subsidiary plants near Norilsk saw President Vladimir Putin declare a state of emergency. More than 21,000 tonnes of diesel leaked from a fuel storage tank, with the fuel seeping into the soil and dying nearby waterways bright red.The Novaya Gazeta journalists reported the factory funnelled the wastewater into wildlife areas and hastily removed their pipes when investigators and emergency services arrived on the scene.Heavy machinery used to clear the pipes appears to have accidentally crushed a car delivering officials to the scene, Novaya Gazeta reported. Interfax said no one was injured in the incident which was also investigated.Police said they had received reports of “unauthorised dumping of liquid waste into the tundra” on the site of the facility, and had opened an enquiry.Norilsk Nickel spokeswoman Tatiana Egorova said earlier on Sunday that employees at the factory had pumped out “clarified water” and that an internal investigation was under way.Russia’s natural resources agency said the decision to remove water from the reservoir was taken to avoid an emergency after heavy rains and recent tests had caused water levels to increase dramatically.The local emergency services in a statement said the wastewater was not likely to reach the nearby Kharayelakh river.The massive fuel spill last month took place at a plant owned by a subsidiary of Norilsk Nickel, which had said that the fuel tank had collapsed or sank due to permafrost melting as a result of climate change.Putin declared an emergency situation after the incident and the head of Norilsk Nickel, oligarch Vladimir Potanin, promised to pay the costs of the clean-up.The Russian authorities said earlier this month they had cleared the spill from the surface of a river, but the full clean-up could take years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2926aef70c502b27210b9d896b5b2cca81bde7d1/0_350_5251_3151/master/5251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d392dddbb962fe69541185e1799ec99c","title":"they are new poor covid 19 fuels rising poverty italy","story":"Patience wears thin over slow pace of economic help for businesses and iniduals hit by hardshipThe queue at a soup kitchen in the Trastevere district of Rome moves at a much slower pace than it did before Italy’s coronavirus outbreak, owing to physical distancing rules. But it is also much longer.“We have gone from serving around 300 meals at a time to 500,” said Lucia Lucchini, who manages the kitchen run by the Catholic charity Sant’Egidio.“There were some very difficult days at the beginning of the lockdown, with many homeless people coming here who were afraid as they didn’t understand what was happening – some were even fined for being on the street. Then we started to see people who hadn’t come before, those who had lost their income and who had no family to turn to.”The new faces are among the 1 million Italians who will be pushed into poverty this year as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, according to estimates from Coldiretti, the farmers’ association.“What is happening is right before everyone’s eyes,” said Lorenzo Bazzana, an economic adviser to Coldiretti. “Families who perhaps were not in difficulty before are now shouldering a very heavy economic burden and are turning to food banks for help.”But for businesses and iniduals desperately needing immediate financial support, Conte’s words amount to little more than fluff.“There is a huge amount of delay in terms of payments to companies and iniduals,” said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the London-based research company Teneo. “And while everyone is focusing on the big figures, at the end of the day what really matters, especially for the weakest members of society, is the state’s capacity to deliver the money. In Italy there is a big problem with state capacity.”As leaders grapple with the economy, much of the onus has fallen on charities and community groups to support those experiencing hardship. In Rome, many supermarkets have adopted the “spesa sospesa” (deferred shopping) initiative, whereby shoppers can buy groceries which charities then deliver to the poor.Last week, Pope Francis established a fund aimed at helping families in the city who are struggling.Volunteers at Nonna Roma, a community group, now regularly deliver food parcels to 7,500 families, compared with 300 before the pandemic.“They are the new poor,” said Alberto Campailla, one of the volunteers. “Among them are domestic workers who lost their jobs, or people who were doing precarious work … but also young professionals who have a drastically reduced income.”Campailla said the government should try to expand its basic income scheme, which was rolled out last year, and help people with rental payments.“There is a serious risk of many people not being able to keep up rental payments and losing their homes,” he said.If the EU recovery fund is approved, the money will not be shared out until 1 January. In return, member states must ensure the funding is not wasted while committing to making changes and investing in projects that bring economic growth.Until then, the only possible funding Italy could access from Brussels is via the Sure programme, which mainly provides additional cash for furlough schemes.Many shops and other businesses across Italy have not reopened since lockdown measures were eased. Those that have are struggling to make ends meet.“A lot of our business comes from hotels or events, such as weddings, which have been cancelled,” said Enzo Russo, who owns a florist with his wife, Antonella, in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood. “We need a strong response from the government, if it continues like this it could be very dangerous.”Gianpaolo Grilli, whose family-run furniture business is nearby, said: “I don’t have much faith in the talks that are happening. Italy is full of small businesses that have not only provided the economic backbone, but social solidity. Politicians haven’t understood this. We don’t want handouts, we want laws that enable us to plan and invest.”“Regardless of the amount of money that could come from Brussels, the prospects are pretty dire,” said Piccoli. “And I don’t think this government has the ability to put together a holistic, comprehensive, credible and effective plan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance. Let young people enjoy being teenagers so we can enjoy adulthood.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, the people featured recommend these Instagram accounts: @bodyposipanda @i_weigh @mattzhaig @crazyheadcomics @muslimgirl @the_indian_feminist @privtoprog @Ayat_Zaman"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revolt"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Nabil MounzerEPAThe planned easing of restrictions on overseas travel from next month could be delayed, Ministers in the incoming Government have signalled.Under pressure from public health officials concerned about a possible resurgence of Covid-19 cases linked to foreign travel, key Ministers on Sunday urged caution in any loosening of the restrictions.National travel restrictions are being lifted today in the latest phase of easing of restrictions in the Government’s “roadmap” out of the lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic, and a wide variety of shops and services are now allowed reopen, but the advice against non-essential foreign travel remains.Last week, the outgoing government committed to compiling a “green list” of countries with low infection rates with which travel would be allowed from July 9th. On Sunday, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, the incoming Minister for Transport, warned against “turning on the taps” on foreign travel and urged the public to holiday at home this summer.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly also signalled a cautious approach to easing foreign travel restrictions.New casesJust three new Covid-19 cases were reported on Sunday, the lowest such daily figure since March 8th 23 were reported on Saturday. One death was reported on Sunday and six on Saturday.Mr Ryan said the new Government should continue to “heed the scientific advice” which has served the country well so far.By staying at home for holidays this summer, the public can “put money into the economy”, help small businesses and look after their health, he told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics programme.Warning of the possibility of a second wave or even third wave of infections, Mr Ryan said the opening up of foreign travel should proceed slowly.Most Irish people had already “voted with their feet” by opting to holiday at home due to the possible risks, he pointed out. “I don’t think we should be turning on the taps of huge amounts of additional travel, particularly not in the coming months when it’s so uncertain.”‘Framework list’Mr Donnelly acknowledged the Government was committed to publishing a “framework list” of other countries with low infection rates with which travel could be permitted, but he insisted no decision has been made on when this list would be activated.“We have to strike a balance to ensure businesses can continue but we also have to minimise the chance of a second surge,” Mr Donnelly said.The way a list would operate would also have to be examined, he said, citing the example of Portugal, which has had a low level of infection until a spike recently.The Minister for Health said he had already had discussions on the issue with chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, who said on Friday he was “more than nervous” about the prospect of the imminent lifting of overseas travel restrictions.“What worries me most now is travel from overseas and I fear many planning foreign trips. 2020 is a year for a staycation. Stay in Ireland, spend locally and follow public health advice,” Dr Holohan tweeted at the weekend.

Photograph: Nick BradshawMost shops and other businesses can reopen, and travel is being allowed nationally, from today, under the biggest easing of Covid-19 restrictions since the pandemic began.Cafes and restaurants, hotels, “pubs operating as restaurants”, hairdressers, beauty salons and driving schools are among the retail services that can restart operations under this phase of the easing of restrictions, provided they put in place infection-control measures.Galleries, museums and cinemas are also free to reopen their doors.The public is still being asked to keep at least two metres away from others where possible, to limit the time they spend in close contact with others, and to mix outdoors rather than indoors.Over-70s and at-risk groups are advised to stay at home “as much as possible” and to limit physical contact with other people.People are also being asked to keep a daily log of those they meet for contact-tracing purposes.The recommendation against non-essential travel outside Ireland remains in place in phase three of the Government’s “roadmap” for reopening business and society.Travel is also permitted to Ireland’s offshore islands now, rather than in August as originally envisaged.Gatherings of up to 50 people indoors and 200 outdoors are permitted from Monday. This means weddings, funerals, sports events and conferences can go ahead within these limits.Close-contact sports, indoor gyms, swimming pools and other sports facilities can all reopen their doors from today, as can summer camps, creches, youth clubs and adult education facilities.In childcare, children will be grouped into pods of between six and 12 to reduce the risk of transmitting Covid-19.Employees are still advised to work from home where they can.Many of the restrictions being lifted today were supposed to have remained in place for longer over the summer, but the easing of restrictions was brought forward earlier this month by the outgoing government due to progress made in suppressing the virus.Businesses reopening are required to implement physical distancing arrangements in their premises to limit the spread of Covid-19. These are likely to include protective screens, spaced queuing, limits on customer numbers at any one time, cleaning stations and the closure of changing rooms.Public-health officials say that, weeks after the easing of restrictions began, the disease remains largely suppressed with low numbers of new cases daily. However, they have expressed concern about a rise in cases related to foreign travel and among younger people.People are still being advised to practise cough etiquette and proper hand hygiene, and to avoid crowded areas.DeathOne more person diagnosed with Covid-19 has died, the Department of Health reported on Sunday. This brings to 1,735 the number of deaths related to the disease in the Republic.There were also another three confirmed cases notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on Sunday, the department said. The total of Covid-19 cases now stands at 25,439, it said. There were 19 confirmed cases of the disease in hospital on Saturday evening and 103 suspected cases, according to the Health Service Executive operation report. Eleven confirmed cases were in ICU, along with five suspected cases.The North’s department of health reported one more Covid-19 death on Sunday, taking the total number of fatalities in Northern Ireland to 550.Meanwhile, the time taken to refer people for Covid-19 tests has doubled over the past week, new figures show. Last week, the average turnaround from a referral to appointment was 1.8 days, up from 0.8 days a week earlier.Just 39 per cent of referrals were being made within 24 hours, against 81 per cent a week earlier.The turnaround from the time a swab is taken to the lab result was unchanged, at 0.9 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Documents reveal de-facto ban on lending to those getting State wage subsidiesFormer master has campaigned publicly against plan to move hospital to St Vincent\u0026rsquosIreland one of 14 EU states violating charter on equality at work, rights body saysElimination of discrimination should be \u0026lsquocore\u0026rsquo for Government, say rights groupSome FF TDs unhappy at inclusion of Stephen Donnelly, Norma Foley in CabinetArchbishop Martin says recognition exists that needs of Catholic Church different to those of smaller denominationsRecommendation against non-essential travel outside Ireland remains in placeMinisters urge caution on loosening restrictions amid fears of second Covid-19 waveEasing Covid-19 restrictions, Brexit and looming recession high on immediate agendaClifden doctor says face masks should be mandatory as Covid-19 restrictions liftMan arrested after shots fired at a house in Shangan Park at about 2.30 in the afternoonTravel throughout the State will be permitted with face coverings mandatory on public transportFamily speaks of special bond: \u0026lsquoHe taught his mummy so much.

AIB has introduced wide-ranging restrictions on mortgage lending in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, internal documents seen by The  reveal.They include a de-facto ban on mortgage lending to those in receipt of State wage subsidies and extra scrutiny on applications from people working in “high risk” sectors of the economy.The changes, which will extend to its specialist mortgage lenders EBS and Haven, were described as “frightening” by one mortgage market source, who added it would have “huge ramifications”.The changes to policy are outlined in a credit policy update distributed to EBS lending managers on June 17th.Self-employed applicantsAs of last Monday, more than 400,000 workers were having their wages supported through the scheme, while over 465,000 people were receiving the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP).In the case of joint applications where one person’s income is affected by being in receipt of the payments, that person’s income is discounted in full when applying the Central Bank’s loan-to-income rules. Bank staff managing applications from “Covid-impacted applicants” have been told to “ensure no ETWS evident, also obtain up to date payslips to ensure no ETWS evident”.The document also indicates that some sectors of the economy, particularly exposed to Covid-19, will come under extra scrutiny when assessing applications, with lending managers told to “pay particular attention to the sector that applicants work in when assessing the sustainability of their income”.Lenders are advised to “look at the sector . . .\u0026nbspSectors with a longer term impact will need enhanced analysis addressing long-term sustainability”.A spokesman for AIB said “at a time of unprecedented economic instability triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, AIB considers it prudent to review its mortgage lending policies to ensure our mortgage loans continue to be suitable and affordable for our customers.”The bank said it is “imperative the mistakes of the past are not repeated”, and that customers “are not exposed to unnecessary risk and that their loans are sustainable”. The spokesman said the group will keep its mortgage procedures under review as the Covid-19 situation evolves.Those coming off the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) will be required to supply a month’s worth of payslips, as well as current account statements showing the social welfare payment has stopped.Bonus payments will be “closely scrutinised”, the document says, adding “in practice this will mean that bonus payments in the main will be excluded”, while overtime, commission and bonuses will “need to be clearly demonstrable in a go forward scenario”.‘Limitied risk appetite’The document also outlines a series of policy changes for Buy to Let (BTL) mortgages, as well as equity release and top-up loans. Amid likely rent declines in the months ahead, income from a BTL property being financed is to be excluded in a range of scenarios, including those applying for their first such loan.While top-ups for home improvements remain unchanged, the document states that “equity releases for home improvements are out of scope”. There are a range of changes to how the bank will implement exceptions to the central bank’s macro-prudential rules, the strict lending ratios introduced to arrest credit-driven house price growth.For second time and subsequent buyers, exemptions to the loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios are closed. Loans greater than €500,000 are also closed for exemptions to the lending rules. Applications which are moving from the approval in principal stage to a letter of offer, with an exception in place, will be honoured, the bank says.Exceptions to policy, aside from minor documentation exceptions “for which there is limited risk appetite”, are closed - this applies to new lending and those who have received approval in principle, who will be re-assessed and may find themselves declined. Negative equity trade uptrade down mortgages are also closed, which will apply to new lending, as well as new and existing applications with approval in principle.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290726.1593338850!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 pandemic revealed ageist attitudes in ireland says charity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe World Health Organisation predicts  22 per cent of the global population will be over 60 by 2050. Photograph: Getty ImagesPublic commentary during the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed “ageist attitudes”, a Galway charity which works with older people has said. Cope Galway, which also works with the homeless and victims of domestic abuse, said older people, and the over-70s in particular, face loneliness and isolation which has been compounded by restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement in advance of the publication of its annual report, the charity said: “Some public commentary during this time has revealed ageist attitudes, inappropriately biased language and ageist terms within certain contexts.” Cope Galway saw a 20 per cent spike in demand for its services last year, assisting 2,984 people. It will host an online session with UN special rapporteur on the protection and promotion of human rights Prof Fionnuala Ní Aoláin on Monday to launch the report.Speaking in advance of the event, keynote speaker Prof Ní Aoláin, who is regents professor and robina professor of law, public policy and society at the University of Minnesota, said the charity had brought attention to the specific needs and rights of older people while affirming their dignity. “Not only are older people an important group supported by Cope Galway, but the volunteer community – the heartbeat of Cope Galway’s work – are significantly made up of older adults.”The charity’s chief executive Jacquie Horan said she wanted to highlight the valuable contribution older people offer “when, too often, old age can be seen as a burden. We want to change the narrative, to flip the script and to focus on the invaluable support and contribution older people offer”.Referring to recent research emerging from NUI Galway, Ms Horan said there is concerning evidence that older people are portrayed as “mass consumers of valuable and limited resources that block treatment for younger, healthier and seemingly more productive iniduals”.“This devalues the status of older people as equal citizens and the perceived value that we place on their contributions, and their lives, in our society.”Some 31 per cent of the charity’s volunteers are over 65, and 18 per cent are over 70, Ms Horan said. “As a global society, there are more and more of us experiencing the privilege of ageing. By 2050, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 22 per cent of our global population will be over 60… achieving equal access to healthy ageing requires concerted global, national and local action – and a decisive end to ageist attitudes.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290879.1593368189!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"family of noah donohoe 14 grateful for love and empathy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPSNI detectives are seeking to trace the final movements of 14-year-old Noah Donohoe to try to determine why he died.  Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePSNI detectives are seeking to trace the final movements of 14-year-old Noah Donohoe to try to determine why he died.The body of the missing teenager was found on Saturday morning in a storm drain in north Belfast. Police do not suspect foul play.The Donohoe family in a statement on Sunday expressed their “heartfelt gratitude for the support, outpouring of love, and empathy” they received.“From walking with us, both physically and spiritually, to feeling our pain, we recognise that everyone has lost Noah,” said the family.“Noah’s mummy always told him that he would change the world,” they said.“He was very special. It is very hard to do justice or honour the extraordinary relationship Noah and his mummy shared. In his 14 years his mummy got so much from their special bond, he taught his mummy so much. They were each other’s world.”They said that details of the funeral would be announced soon. “Noah loved his school and his friends at school, and we know that they will be grieving too and they need to say goodbye too,” they said.Prayers for Noah and for his mother Fiona and family were said at a number of church services in Belfast on Sunday.Paul McBride, the principal of St Malachy’s College where Noah went to school said the whole school mourned his loss. He described Noah as a talented cellist and keen basketball and rugby player. In his three years at the school he won a number of awards including “‘The Spirit of the College Award’, full attendance, class prizes and UK Maths Challenge success.“He was a natural leader who led by example. His caring nature, calm demeanour and big smile were some of his great gifts that helped others do their best,” said Mr McBride.Noah Donohoe, from south Belfast, went missing after cycling across the city on Sunday (June 21st). He was last seen in the Northwood Road area just after 6pm.He had cycled approximately 4 km across the city from his home in south Belfast to north Belfast, where police believe he may have fallen off his bicycle and hit his head.He was seen discarding his clothes and cycling naked, actions which police and his family said were “completely out of character.”Scores of volunteers assisted police in searches that were conducted throughout last week. People hoped that the teenager may have suffered some form of concussion or amnesia and that eventually he would be discovered alive.But on Saturday morning the PSNI reported that his body was discovered around 9.45 am that morning.PSNI Superintendent Muir Clark said a post mortem is to take place and the investigation into the circumstances of his disappearance is continuing.“But there is no evidence to suggest foul play,” he said at a press conference at the weekend at PSNI Musgrave Station in central Belfast.He said Noah’s body was found in a storm drain complex in north Belfast that was almost a kilometre long.It had been searched for a number of days but finding the body took so long because it was an “extremely challenging environment”. He said specialist search and rescue officers were involved. “They were working in the pitch black.”Supt Clark said it was possible that the reported head injury that Noah suffered played a part in his death. He hoped the post mortem would provide some answers in this regard.Asked was the storm drain covered or would a person have to proactively enter it or could they fall into it Supt Clark replied: “You would have to proactively enter it.”During the searches last week Noah’s backpack, laptop and a copy of the book Twelve Rules For Life by Jordan B Peterson were recovered.Supt Clark said police were continuing to examine the laptop. He hoped this might answer some of the questions about why Noah had cycled from the south of the city to the north.Supt Clark also criticised rumours about the teenager’s disappearance that were circulating on social media and, he said, were “completely without foundation”.One man is due to appear in court over a video he posted about the missing teenager.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289799.1593202890!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government considering purchase of military jet aircraft","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t    Six RAF Typhoons   headed towards counties Derry and Donegal to intercept these Russian Tupolev aircraft  on March 7th, forcing them to alter course. Photograph: RAFPA WireThe Government is considering the purchase of military jet aircraft that would have the capacity to intercept high-altitude planes and fully police Irish skies. A new five-year Defence Forces investment strategy document has said that “future projects at a preplanning stage” include the potential for “air combat interceptors”. Such aircraft are designed to scramble quickly when there is a need to intercept unwelcome or unidentified planes which could include foreign military or hijacked airliners. Although no decisions have been made on whether to pursue such high-end military hardware, it would require a major financial commitment potentially running into hundreds of millions of euro.Expensive ground radar equipment would also be required to detect encroaching traffic in Irish airspace.“Consideration of Air Combat Interceptors would be dependent on additional funding,” the Defence Forces – Equipment Development Plan 2020-24 document, published on Friday, states. High-speed aircraftUnlike most EU countries, Ireland does not have the capacity to fully secure its airspace by intercepting high-speed aircraft. A Defence Forces spokesman said “such a capability is being kept under review, and is based on threat assessment, but budget has not been allocated for this at this time. Such an aircraft would be capable of policing all airborne craft in Irish sovereign airspace, particularly those that are fast moving.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Defence said it is a “proposal that needs to be developed and scoped out”. “The assessment would consider the demands that may be made of such interceptors and the military capabilities it would be expected to be able to supply, together with the associated technical specification and capability requirements.“This utility would have to be assessed against the significant investment of public funds, in respect of the initial investment and ongoing operational costs.”The Air Corps has previously used both the De Havilland Vampire, a British jet fighter, and the French-designed Fouga Magister jet trainer aircraft. It also continues to operate the Ministerial Air Transport Service jet aircraft however, the type of plane under consideration would represent a major upgrade in technology. Earlier this year Maj Gen Ralph James, who retired as head of the Air Corps in 2015, said the State would need about 16 jet fighters with three crews each to implement a full air-defence capability. CertificationHe said each pilot would need up to 400 hours behind the controls of the jet before earning fast-response certification. A jet programme of this kind would likely cost well in excess of €1 billion.Any such cost would impact the decision-making process – particularly given the cost to the State of the Covid-19 crisis. However, the question of airspace security is not academic. Last March, a number of Russian Tupolev TU-95 “Bear” bombers, also used as long-range maritime patrol planes, entered Irish airspace. In response, six Royal Air Force Typhoons were scrambled from bases in Scotland and England and headed towards counties Derry and Donegal to intercept, forcing them to alter course. Quick-reaction aircraft from Nato allies Norway and France also took part in the response.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290942.1593366494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin to return michael collins portrait to taoiseach s office","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Michael Collins portrait hanging in former taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s office last week. Photograph: Leo VaradkarTwitterNew Taoiseach, Micheál Martin has asked his predecessor, Leo Varadkar to put back a portrait of Michael Collins in the Taoiseach’s office to hang beside one of Eamon De Valera to symbolise unity 100 years on from the Civil War.Photos appeared in the media last week of Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar removing a portrait of Michael Collins from the Taoiseach’s office as he prepared to make way for his successor, the leader of the Fianna Fail party.But now Mr Martin has revealed he asked Mr Varadkar to put back the portrait of fellow Corkman, Collins as the two parties enter a historic coalition and prepare to mark the centenary of the bitter Civil War over the Treaty.“Leo Varadkar said to me during the week that he was taking down the portrait of Michael Collins and I said, ‘well actually, you might put it back up and I’m going to put De Valera next to him in the Taoiseach’s office’.“I have a wonderful portrait of De Valera in my own office, the opposition office, and I am going to bring that over just to symbolise what has happened - Lemass is already there and we will find a place for a bust of Jack Lynch too.”Speaking in Cork after returning for a brief visit to catch up with family and friends, Mr Martin acknowledged that the coming few years, marking the centenary of the Irish Civil War will be challenging for the new government.But he expressed confidence that the new coalition arrangement involving Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, successors to the pro and anti-Treaty sides in the conflict, and the Green Party will be able to rise to the challenge.“It will be interesting in terms of commemorating the Civil War, I’ve already had some discussions with people in relation to that and I spoke to President Michael D Higgins in Áras an Uachtaran yesterday about it.“And it will have to be sensitive and be honest and it will have to commemorate events with a maturity that can educate and provide insights to the younger generation in terms of the formation and evolution of the state.”Mr Martin said he believed that the new coalition could find inspiration for marking the centenary of the bitter conflict from some of the participants such as former Taoiseach, Sean Lemass who lost his brother, Noel in the conflict.“It was Sean Lemass who said that it was often the generations that followed the Civil War that were often the most bitter - that many of the protagonists themselves weren’t as bitter themselves, that they deeply regretted it.“And Lemass’s tribute to WT Cosgrave in the Dail when WT Cosgrave retired was an extraordinary tribute to the man and Lemass had suffered with the loss of his brother, Noel in the Civil War and I think that’s where we have to go.“History to me is about revelation, you can’t look back judgementally - we can’t import today’s values back 100 years ago, we have to learn from it and try and understand it and not cover it up - history belongs to no party.”Earlier, during the vote for Mr Martin as Taoiseach, Mr Varadkar had struck a similar note saying that Civil War politics involving enmity between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael were now clearly over as evidence by the new coalition deal.“This is a historic occasion.

But on Saturday in Dublin, the man who seemed destined to fall short defied the odds and finally reached his summit.Five weeks before his 60th birthday, and 31 years since he first entered Dáil Éireann, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was elected Taoiseach.All that time he put in – the good days and the bad days, the graft and the grit, the public drama and the private tragedies – was suddenly telescoped into eight minutes of sitting alone in a strange silence in an unfamiliar hall as he waited for the votes to be verified and result declared.It must have felt like forever for Micheál, shifting nervously in his seat, taking deep breaths, weaving and unwinding his fingers.Because of Covid-19 restrictions he had to sit on his own surround by empty seats, colleagues and family socially distanced out of the picture. His wife and children could not travel from Cork, and parliamentary party colleagues were not allowed within touching distance in the temporary chamber.In Leinster House the setpiece election of a new taoiseach is an exciting, emotional occasion. Micheál didn’t get to experience it. His pandemic-driven ascension in Dublin’s vast Convention Centre was a drab affair, played out in a soulless space which was just too big for any atmosphere to develop.That wasn’t any fault of the Oireachtas authorities who put in long hours getting the venue ready for this unprecedented Dáil session. There was nothing they could do about those yawning gaps sucking the life out of the place.But it meant that the new Taoiseach, on the biggest day of his political career and one of the biggest days of his life, had no colleagues at his elbow to distract him with small talk, and no opportunity to bank up priceless memories with proud family and friends in the public gallery. Old silver bellThe votes were checked and rechecked. After what seemed like an age, the Ceann Comhairle dinged the old silver bell he brought with him from the Dáil chamber. Sean Ó Fearghail was installed behind a desk on the main stage, with a cast of officials arranged around more desks. It looked like a theatrical set for a play about a war crimes tribunal.Micheál looked up towards Ó Feargháil, the hint of smile beginning to broaden out.“The motion is carried, and the Dáil has agreed to nominate Deputy Micheál Martin for appointment by the President to be Taoiseach.”The outgoing taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, having earlier pronounced the end of civil war politics before voting with the rest of his party for a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, magnanimously led the applause.Leo Varadkar was first to his feet as most, but not all politicians, rose to congratulate a fellow TD on his great achievement.The Taoiseach-elect could never have envisaged delivering his first speech in such strange circumstances. When he spoke of his family – wife, children and his late parents – his voice thickened and wavered. You could see how much this moment meant to him and his family, and how he wished his father and mother were there to witness it.He remembered a “blessed” childhood in a “close-knit working-class community” in Cork.Speaking of that city, a Taoiseach in Cork South Central isn’t the half of it. The four-seater constituency also boasts the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Simon Coveney) and the Minister for Public Expenditure (Michael McGrath).Some people are finding this difficult. “Three of them in the Government,” sighed an incredulous observer from Kerry as word of the new Cabinet line-up spread. “Three from South Central… It’s like Cork beating Kerry in the All-Ireland final. No, it’s worse even. It’s like… like England winning the World Cup.”But there was comfort in the elevation to Minister for Education of first-time TD, Fianna Fáil’s Norma Foley from Kerry. World CupFor TDs with aspirations, landing a job as a senior Minister is also like winning a World Cup. Many want to be chosen, few are called. With three coalitions leaders vying up 15 jobs, noses were sure to be out of joint.The Fianna Fáil leader was never going to keep everyone happy. But people were nursing expectations. The favoured few would be summoned inidually to his office to get the good news.A posse of hopefuls from all the parties raced after him to Leinster House to await a call. The route from Leinster House to the Taoiseach’s office in Government Buildings is via a glass-covered overhead walkway called the Bridge of Sighs.Journalists took up position in a discreet nook below the bridge and reported breathlessly on who was and who wasn’t crossing it.No sign of Jim O’Callaghan, the senior council from Dublin Bay South who had been tipped for preferment. And no sign of Galway’s Anne Rabbitte, another Fianna Fáiler supposed to be very much in the frame. Anne wore a distinctive bright red cape jacket for the occasion.“If she doesn’t get the nod she’ll be rampaging around Leinster House in her cape looking like Bishop Brennan after he realised Ted kicked him up the arse,” sneered a non-contender. Anne didn’t get a ministry, but she looked very calm when she returned to the Convention Centre for the announcement of the ones who did.Neither did Jim O’Callaghan. “I’m going to the Mansion House to set up an alternative government,” he joked to a colleague. Jim isn’t from the west of Ireland so there must be another reason he didn’t figure.‘Cromwell’s Cabinet’ Mayo’s Dara Calleary, the party’s deputy leader, was expected to land a senior portfolio. Instead he got Chief Whip, which is classed as a super-junior job and means he can sit in a high chair at the Cabinet table but he can’t vote. There is outrage in Mayo. “A Cabinet fit for Cromwell,” thundered the Western People on Sunday, also noting the dearth of Ministers from west of the Shannon. “To hell or to Connacht, indeed.”Back at the Dáil’s dockland Versailles, people wondered how the authorities were going to stage the big reveal which traditionally happens when the Taoiseach parades his simpering new line-up into the chamber to a chorus of oohs and aahs.“They can get a 40-foot lorry around the back no bother so nobody will see them coming in,” said an usher. In the end three coaches sufficed – two for the Ministers and one to accommodate Catherine Martin’s job title and the other two members of her thriving family SME: her husband Frances Noel Duffy TD and her brother Vincent P. Martin who bagged one of the Taoiseach’s Seanad nominations. The Greens’ deputy leader now revels in the ridiculous title of Minister for Media, Culture, Arts, Tourism, Sport and the Gaeltacht “and whatever you’re having yourself”, said Mattie McGrath.On Sunday morning, in an effort to reassure voters that the west of Ireland has not been cancelled, a statement was rushed out on behalf of Galway West’s Hildegarde Naughton, now the most senior Government representative on the western seaboard.She “promised to be a voice for Galway West, South Mayo and the broader region in Government”.It seems Hildegarde is a super-duper junior minister and not only gets to sit in a high chair at the Cabinet table but is also allowed to throw all her toys out of the pram on behalf of the west during the meetings. The Taoiseach may attempt to mollify a seething Calleary with similar status next week. HappyMeanwhile, former minister for health Simon Harris, who looked deeply worried before the jobs were disbursed, was more than happy with the plum job of Minister for Higher Education.He has been replaced in health by Stephen Donnelly, who is from the same town as Harris – Gallstones, Co Whitlow.At the end of a long, long day the Cabinet was bussed to Dublin Castle so Ministers could get their seals of office from the President in a socially distant fashion.They were photographed completely spaced out in St Patrick’s Hall, looking like they were waiting for Michael D to drop a shoulder and shout “... 5, 6, 7, 8!” so they could burst into a TikTok dance routine.Then they held their first Cabinet meeting. Taoiseach Martin praised the Greens’ ability to negotiate and singled out their leader for special mention.“When it comes to senior hurling now, Eamon Ryan is like Christy Ring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Justin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"No group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290857.1593357391!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how the world missed the silent spread of the coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Camilla Rothe and her team prepare for a shift at Munich University Hospital earlier this month. Photograph: Laetitia VanconNew York TimesDr Camilla Rothe was about to leave for dinner when the government laboratory called with the surprising test result. Positive. It was January 27th. She had just discovered Germany’s first case of the new coronavirus.But the diagnosis made no sense. Her patient, a businessman from a nearby auto parts company, could have been infected by only one person: a colleague visiting from China. And that colleague should not have been contagious. The visitor had seemed perfectly healthy during her stay in Germany. No coughing or sneezing, no signs of fatigue or fever during two days of long meetings.She told colleagues that she had started feeling ill after the flight back to China. Days later, she tested positive for the coronavirus.Scientists at the time believed that only people with symptoms could spread the coronavirus. They assumed it acted like its genetic cousin, Sars. “People who know much more about coronaviruses than I do were absolutely sure,” recalled Rothe, an infectious disease specialist at Munich University Hospital.But if the experts were wrong – if the virus could spread from seemingly healthy carriers or people who had not yet developed symptoms – the ramifications were potentially catastrophic. Public awareness campaigns, airport screening and stay-home-if-you’re sick policies might not stop it.More aggressive measures might be required: ordering healthy people to wear masks, for instance, or restricting international travel.Rothe and her colleagues were among the first to warn the world. But even as evidence accumulated from other scientists, leading health officials expressed unwavering confidence that symptomless spreading was not important. In the days and weeks to come, politicians, public health officials and rival academics disparaged or ignored the Munich team.Some actively worked to undermine the warnings at a crucial moment, as the disease was spreading unnoticed in French churches, Italian football stadiums and Austrian ski bars. A cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, would become a deadly harbinger of symptomless spreading.Semantic debateInterviews with doctors and public health officials in more than a dozen countries show that for two crucial months – and in the face of mounting genetic evidence – Western health officials and political leaders played down or denied the risk of symptomless spreading.Leading health agencies including the World Health Organisation and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control provided contradictory and sometimes misleading advice. A crucial public health discussion devolved into a semantic debate over what to call infected people without clear symptoms.The two-month delay was a product of faulty scientific assumptions, academic rivalries and, perhaps most important, a reluctance to accept that containing the virus would take drastic measures. The resistance to emerging evidence was one part of the world’s sluggish response to the virus.It is impossible to calculate the human toll of that delay, but models suggest that earlier, aggressive action might have saved tens of thousands of lives. Countries such as Singapore and Australia, which used testing and contact tracing and moved swiftly to quarantine seemingly healthy travellers, fared far better than those that did not.It is now widely accepted that seemingly healthy people can spread the virus, though uncertainty remains over how much they have contributed to the pandemic. Although estimates vary, models using data from Hong Kong, Singapore and China suggest 30 per cent to 60 per cent of spreading occurs when people have no symptoms.“This was, I think, a very simple truth,” Rothe said. “I was surprised that it would cause such a storm. I can’t explain it.”Even now, with more than nine million cases around the world and a death toll approaching 500,000, Covid-19 remains an unsolved riddle. It is too soon to know whether the worst has passed or if a second global wave of infections is about to crash down. But it is clear that an array of countries, from secretive regimes to overconfident democracies, have fumbled their response, misjudged the virus and ignored their own emergency plans.It is also painfully clear that time was a critical commodity in curbing the virus – and that too much of it was wasted.Mild symptomsOn the night of Germany’s first positive test, the virus had seemed far away. Fewer than 100 fatalities had been reported worldwide. Italy, which would become Europe’s ground zero, would not record its first cases for another three days.A few reports out of China had already suggested the possibility of symptomless spreading. But nobody had proved it could happen. That night, Rothe tapped out an email to a few dozen doctors and public health officials. “Infections can actually be transmitted during the incubation period,” she wrote.Three more employees from the auto parts company, Webasto, tested positive the following day. Their symptoms were so mild that, normally, it’s likely that none would have been flagged for testing or would have thought to stay at home.Rothe decided she had to sound the alarm. Her boss, Dr Michael Hoelscher, dashed off an email to the New England Journal of Medicine. “We believe that this observation is of utmost importance,” he wrote.Editors responded immediately. How soon could they see the paper? The next morning, January 30th, public health officials interviewed the Chinese businesswoman by phone. Hospitalised in Shanghai, she explained that she had started feeling sick on the flight home. Looking back, maybe she had had some mild aches or fatigue, but she had chalked them up to a long day of travel.“From her perspective, she was not ill,” said Nadine Schian, a Webasto spokeswoman who was on the call. “She said, ‘okay, I felt tired. But I’ve been in Germany a lot of times before, and I always have jet lag’.”When the health officials described the call, Rothe and Hoelscher quickly finished and submitted their article. Rothe did not talk to the patient herself but said she relied on the health authority summary. Within hours, it was online. It was a modest clinical observation at a key time.Just days earlier, the World Health Organisation had said it needed more information about this very topic. What the authors did not know, however, was that in a suburb 20 minutes away, another group of doctors had also been rushing to publish a report. Neither knew what the other was working on, a seemingly small academic rift that would have global implications.Similar conclusionsThe second group was made up of officials with the Bavarian health authority and Germany’s national health agency, known as the Robert Koch Institute. Inside a suburban office, doctors unfurled mural paper and traced infection routes using coloured pens.Rothe had written that patients appeared to be contagious before the onset of any symptoms. The government team had written that patients appeared to be contagious before the onset of full symptoms – at a time when symptoms were so mild that people might not even recognise them.The Chinese woman, for example, had woken up in the middle of the night feeling jet-lagged. Wanting to be sharp for her meetings, she took a Chinese medicine called 999 – containing the equivalent of a Tylenol tablet – and went back to bed. Perhaps that had masked a mild fever? Perhaps her jet lag was actually fatigue? She had reached for a shawl during a meeting. Maybe that was a sign of chills?After two lengthy phone calls with the woman, doctors at the Robert Koch Institute were convinced that she had simply failed to recognise her symptoms. They wrote to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, casting doubt on Rothe’s findings.Editors there decided that the dispute amounted to hairsplitting. If it took a lengthy interview to identify symptoms, how could anyone be expected to do it in the real world? “The question was whether she had something consistent with Covid-19 or that anyone would have recognised at the time was Covid-19,” said Dr Eric Rubin, the journal’s editor. “The answer seemed to be no.”The journal did not publish the letter. But that would not be the end of it.That weekend, Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian health authority, called Hoelscher of the Munich clinic. “Look, the people in Berlin are very angry about your publication,” Zapf said, according to Hoelscher. He suggested changing the wording of Rothe’s report and replacing her name with those of members of the government task force, Hoelscher said. He refused.The health agency would not discuss the phone call. Until then, Hoelscher said, their report had seemed straightforward. Now it was clear: “Politically, this was a major, major issue.”‘Complete tsunami’On Monday, February 3rd, the journal Science published an article calling Rothe’s report “flawed”. Science reported that the Robert Koch Institute had written to the New England Journal to dispute her findings and correct an error. The Robert Koch Institute declined repeated interview requests over several weeks and did not answer written questions.Rothe’s report quickly became a symbol of rushed research. Scientists said she should have talked to the Chinese patient herself before publishing and that the omission had undermined her team’s work. On Twitter, she and her colleagues were disparaged by scientists and armchair experts alike.“It broke over us like a complete tsunami,” Hoelscher said. The controversy also overshadowed another crucial development out of Munich. The next morning, Dr Clemens-Martin Wendtner made a startling announcement. Wendtner was overseeing treatment of Munich’s Covid-19 patients – there were eight now – and had taken swabs from each.He discovered the virus in the nose and throat at much higher levels, and far earlier, than had been observed in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). That meant it probably could spread before people knew they were sick.But the Science story drowned that news out. If Rothe’s paper had implied that governments might need to do more against Covid-19, the pushback from the Robert Koch Institute was an implicit defence of the conventional thinking.Sweden’s public health agency declared that Rothe’s report had contained major errors. The agency’s website said, unequivocally, that “there is no evidence that people are infectious during the incubation period” – an assertion that would remain online in some form for months.French health officials, too, left no room for debate: “A person is contagious only when symptoms appear,” a government flyer read. “No symptoms  no risk of being contagious.”As Rothe and Hoelscher reeled from the criticism, Japanese doctors were preparing to board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A former passenger had tested positive for coronavirus. Yet on the ship, parties continued. The infected passenger had been off the ship for days, after all. And he hadn’t reported symptoms while on board.Semantic distinctionImmediately after Rothe’s report, the World Health Organisation had noted that patients might transmit the virus before showing symptoms. But the organisation also underscored a point that it continues to make: Patients with symptoms are the main drivers of the epidemic.Once the Science paper was published, however, the organisation waded directly into the debate on Rothe’s work. On Tuesday, February 4th, Dr Sylvie Briand, the agency’s chief of infectious disease preparedness, tweeted a link to the Science paper, calling Rothe’s report flawed.With that tweet, the WHO focused on a semantic distinction that would cloud discussion for months: Was the patient asymptomatic, meaning she would never show symptoms? Or presymptomatic, meaning she became sick later? Or, even more confusing, oligo-symptomatic, meaning that she had symptoms so mild that she didn’t recognise them?To some doctors, the focus on these arcane distinctions felt like whistling in the graveyard. A person who feels healthy has no way to know that she is carrying a virus or is about to become sick. Airport temperature checks will not catch these people. Neither will asking them about their symptoms nor telling them to stay home when they feel ill.The WHO later said that the tweet had not been intended as a criticism.One group paid little attention to this brewing debate: the Munich-area doctors working to contain the cluster at the auto parts company. They spoke daily with potentially sick people, monitoring their symptoms and tracking their contacts.“All you need is a pair of eyes,” she said. “You don’t need rocket-science virology.” But she remained confident. “We will be proven right,” she told Hoelscher.That night, Rothe received an email from Dr Michael Libman, an infectious disease specialist in Montreal. He thought that criticism of the paper amounted to semantics. Her paper had convinced him of something: “The disease will most likely eventually spread around the world.”Startling callOn February 4th, Britain’s emergency scientific committee met and, while its experts did not rule out the possibility of symptomless transmission, nobody put much stock in Rothe’s paper.“It was very much a hearsay study,” said Wendy Barclay, a virologist and member of the committee, known as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. “In the absence of real robust epidemiology and tracing, it isn’t obvious until you see the data.”The data would soon arrive, and from an unexpected source. Böhmer, from the Bavarian health team, received a startling phone call in the second week of February.Virologists had discovered a subtle genetic mutation in the infections of two patients from the Munich cluster. They had crossed paths for the briefest of moments, one passing a saltshaker to the other in the company cafeteria, when neither had symptoms. Their shared mutation made it clear that one had infected the other.Böhmer had been sceptical of symptomless spreading. But now there was no doubt: “It can only be explained with presymptomatic transmission,” Böhmer said. Now it was Böhmer who sounded the alarm. She said she promptly shared the finding, and its significance, with the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Neither organisation included the discovery in its regular reports.A week after receiving Böhmer’s information, European health officials were still declaring, “We are still unsure whether mild or asymptomatic cases can transmit the virus.” There was no mention of the genetic evidence. WHO officials said the genetic discovery informed their thinking, but they made no announcement of it.European health officials said the German information was one early piece of an emerging picture that they were still piecing together. The doctors in Munich were increasingly frustrated and confused by the WHO. First, the group wrongly credited the Chinese government with alerting German authorities to the first infection. Government officials and doctors said the auto parts company itself sounded the alarm.Then, the WHO’s emergency director, Dr Michael Ryan, said on February 27th that the significance of symptomless spreading was becoming a myth. And Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the organisation’s technical lead on the coronavirus response, suggested it was nothing to worry about.“It’s rare but possible,” she said. “It’s very rare.” The agency still maintains that people who cough or sneeze are more contagious than people who don’t. But there is no scientific consensus on how significant this difference is or how it affects the spread of virus.And so, with evidence mounting, the Munich team could not understand how the WHO could be so sure that symptomless spreading was insignificant. “At this point, for us it was clear,” said Wendtner, the senior doctor overseeing treatment of the Covid-19 patients. “This was a misleading statement by the WHO.”Silent spreadersThe Munich cluster was not the only warning. Chinese health authorities had explicitly cautioned that patients were contagious before showing symptoms. A Japanese bus driver was infected while transporting seemingly healthy tourists from Wuhan, China. And by the middle of February, 355 people aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship had tested positive. About one-third of the infected passengers and staff had no symptoms.Public health officials saw danger in promoting the risk of silent spreaders. If quarantining sick people and tracing their contacts could not reliably contain the disease, governments might abandon those efforts altogether.In Sweden and Britain, for example, discussion swirled about enduring the epidemic until the population obtained “herd immunity”. Public health officials worried that might lead to overwhelmed hospitals and needless deaths. Plus, preventing silent spreading required aggressive, widespread testing that was then impossible for most countries.“It’s not like we had some easy alternative,” said Libman, the Canadian doctor. “The message was basically, ‘If this is true, we’re in trouble’.”European health officials said they were reluctant to acknowledge silent spreading because the evidence was trickling in and the consequences of a false alarm would have been severe. “These reports are seen everywhere, all over the world,” said Dr Josep Jansa, a senior European Union health official. “Whatever we put out, there’s no way back.”Looking back, health officials should have said that, yes, symptomless spreading was happening and they did not understand how prevalent it was, said Dr Agoritsa Baka, a senior EU doctor. But doing that, she said, would have amounted to an implicit warning to countries: What you’re doing might not be enough.While public health officials hesitated, some doctors acted. At a conference in Seattle in mid-February, Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University professor, said his research suggested Covid-19’s rapid spread could be explained only if there were infectious patients with unremarkable symptoms or no symptoms at all.In the audience that day was Steven Chu, the Nobel-winning physicist and former US energy secretary. “If left to its own devices, this disease will spread through the whole population,” he remembers Shaman warning.Afterwards, Chu began insisting that healthy colleagues at his Stanford University laboratory wear masks. Doctors in Cambridge, England, concluded that asymptomatic transmission was a big source of infection and advised local health workers and patients to wear masks well before the British government acknowledged the risk of silent spreaders.Spreading the diseaseUS authorities, faced with a shortage, actively discouraged the public from buying masks. “Seriously people ? STOP BUYING MASKS!”, surgeon general Jerome Adams tweeted February 29th.By early March, while the WHO continued pressing the case that symptom-free transmission was rare, science was breaking in the other direction. Researchers in Hong Kong estimated that 44 per cent of Covid-19 transmission occurred before symptoms began, an estimate that was in line with a British study that put that number as high as 50 per cent.The Hong Kong study concluded that people became infectious about two days before their illness emerged, with a peak on their first day of symptoms. By the time patients felt the first headache or scratch in the throat, they might have been spreading the disease for days.In Belgium, doctors saw that maths in action as Covid-19 tore through nursing homes, killing nearly 5,000 people. “We thought that by monitoring symptoms and asking sick people to stay at home, we would be able to manage the spread,” said Steven Van Gucht, head of Belgium’s Covid-19 scientific committee. “It came in through people with hardly any symptoms.”More than 700 people aboard the Diamond Princess were sickened. Fourteen died. Researchers estimate that most of the infection occurred early on, while seemingly healthy passengers socialised and partied. Government scientists in Britain concluded in late April that 5 per cent to 6 per cent of symptomless health care workers were infected and might have been spreading the virus.In Munich, Hoelscher has asked himself many times whether things would have been different if world leaders had taken the issue seriously earlier. He compared their response to a rabbit stumbling upon a poisonous snake. “We were watching that snake and were somehow paralysed,” he said.As the research coalesced in March, European health officials were convinced. “Okay, this is really a big issue,” Baka recalled thinking. “It plays a big role in the transmission.”By the end of the month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was rethinking its policy on masks. It concluded that up to 25 per cent of patients might have no symptoms. Since then, the CDC, governments around the world and, finally, the WHO have recommended that people wear masks in public.Still, the WHO is sending confusing signals. Earlier this month, Van Kerkhove, the technical lead, repeated that transmission from asymptomatic patients was “very rare”. After an outcry from doctors, the agency said there had been a misunderstanding.“In all honesty, we don’t have a clear picture on this yet,” Van Kerkhove said. She said she had been referring to a few studies showing limited transmission from asymptomatic patients.Contact tracingRecent internet ads confused the matter even more. A Google search in mid-June for studies on asymptomatic transmission returned a WHO advertisement titled “People With No Symptoms – Rarely Spread Coronavirus. ”Clicking on the link, however, offered a much more nuanced picture: “Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus. It is not yet known how often it happens.” After the New York Times asked about those discrepancies, the organisation removed the advertisements.Back in Munich, there is little doubt left. Böhmer, the Bavarian government doctor, published a study in the Lancet last month that relied on extensive interviews and genetic information to methodically track every case in the cluster. In the months after Rothe swabbed her first patient, 16 infected people were identified and caught early. All survived.Aggressive testing and flawless contact tracing contained the spread. Böhmer’s study found “substantial” transmission from people with no symptoms or exceptionally mild, nonspecific symptoms. Rothe and her colleagues got a footnote. – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive half uks imported covid 19 infections pakistan","story":"Half of Britain’s imported coronavirus cases originate from Pakistan, The  understands, amid calls for tougher quarantine checks on arrivals from high risk countries.More than 65,000 people have travelled to Britain on 190 flights since March 1 from Pakistan, which is reporting 4,000 Covid-19 cases a day, and has seen a new spike in the disease after easing its lockdown measures. Most are thought to have UK passports.Data from Public Health England (PHE) shows that 30 cases of coronavirus in people who have travelled from Pakistan since June 4, which is understood to represent half of the incidents of imported infection.With up to two flights a day from Pakistan, there have been reports of some arrivals almost instantly going to hospital for intensive care, amid concerns that the influx has led to localised clusters.Officials are understood to be worried it could lead to a backlash against Britain, through it creating a backdoor for infections into Europe as the UK prepares to open air bridges.Officials are concerned that countries like Portugal may be importing cases from Brazil, but does not wish to say so explicitly because of our own colonial links.Bharat Pankhania, a quarantine expert at Exeter University’s medical school, said the Government needed to concentrate its resources on screening iniduals from high risk countries rather than a blanket light-touch quarantine where no-one is tested or physically supervised in the community.As soon as a country reaches a set threshold, then special screening and tests are done on all inidual arrivals at the border. If they are staying in Bath, for example, then the local public health director is alerted and they are subject to on-the-door checks by his or her team, he said.Concerns that passengers from Pakistan were spreading coronavirus saw one of the world\u0027s biggest long haul airlines suspend flights from the country this week.Dubai carrier Emirates suspended flights out of Pakistan after some 30 passengers on a June 22 flight to Hong Kong tested positive for Covid-19. Etihad and Fly Dubai also suspended flights out of Pakistan.This week, South Korea\u0027s government temporarily banned most people from Pakistan and Bangladesh from entering after it recorded increases in coronavirus cases from those countries.Ten players of Pakistan\u0027s cricket team supposed to take part in an upcoming series in England tested positive this week for Covid-19.British officials are understood to have repeatedly urged Pakistan to enact tougher controls on its flights as cases have grown.Pakistan International Airlines, the national carrier, said it had been flying direct to and from the UK since early April. At first irregular flights were organised according to demand to repatriate British and Pakistani nationals, with up to a dozen trips per week. In the past week the airline has resumed a more regular schedule flying daily to either London or Manchester.A spokesman said passengers were screened in Pakistan with heat sensors and had to wear masks. Anyone recording a high temperature during screening was not allowed on board.Officials estimate that at any one time there are some 100,000 British nationals in Pakistan, most of them dual nationals. Some 25,000 British nationals were repatriated from Pakistan between April 4 and May 13, almost all of them British Pakistanis.A Government spokesman said: The new health measures at the border are informed by science, backed by the public and designed to keep us all safe. We are seeing a high level of compliance and we expect this to continue as the vast majority of people will play their part to help stop the spread of this disease.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"maxine peake vs laurence fox reveals double standards chattering","story":"The trouble with double-standards in the age of mass communication is that everybody can see them. Where once an inidual, institution or movement might have hoped to conceal their hypocrisies, now they are there for everyone to witness. So it is with the case of Maxine Peake. This week, the actress made headlines because of an interview in which she alleged that the Israelis taught the US police how to kill George Floyd. The problem is that it is a lie. Even the far-Left, anti-Israel group Amnesty – widely alleged to be the source of the story – has denied that it is true. It is simple anti-Zionism reheated to suit the current moment.So perhaps it isn’t surprising that a Jeremy Corbyn protégée like Rebecca Long-Bailey should have retweeted the interview in which Peake made this claim. Apart from its racism, the interview included the standard actress stuff about the wonders of Corbynism and the importance of bringing down capitalism. They aren’t fools, these actresses. They know that if there’s one way that their profession will be reinvigorated, post-lockdown, it will be through the obliteration of the market economy. But Labour is now in new hands. And Keir Starmer swiftly sacked Long-Bailey. While his predecessor said there was no place for racism at the top of Labour, Starmer has done something to prove it.But the question I want answered is: where is Equity, the actors’ union? Earlier this year, after the actor Laurence Fox appeared on Question Time, the union (of which he is not even a member) denounced him. Fox’s crime was to say that he didn’t think Britain was a racist country. For this, Equity branded him a “disgrace”. Actor after actor lined up to condemn him and lobby to make sure he never worked again. After Fox took legal action and forced an apology out of Equity, the entire “race equality committee” of the union resigned.Perhaps this is why Equity have been so silent on Peake. Because there is no one left to do the full witch-dunking denunciation act. Or perhaps the silence is explained in another way. The same way that one might explain the silence of the actors and celebs who clambered over each other to denounce Fox. Could it be that most people in the acting and celebrity worlds are happy with someone who promotes conspiracy theories, so long as it is wrapped up in the fashionable idiot language of anti-capitalism and “equality”?I suspect so. In which case I would strongly recommend that Peake and her colleagues mull on something. What Fox said on Question Time reflects the sentiment of the vast majority of the British public. What Peake said reflects the views of a small group of malcontents who the public has rejected at the ballot box every time we have had the chance. So here is the thing, my actor-y friends. It’s not the public who are living in some hyper-partisan, out-of-touch bubble. It’s you.

Public buildings will be lit up in NHS blue, including the Royal Albert Hall, Blackpool Tower, the Shard and the Wembley Arch.The letter reads: “As businesses we will be part of that moment because we too have many people to thank. Our colleagues, our suppliers, our customers and our communities. These have been difficult times for us all and we have only survived because of them.Insisting that the applause is “only the start”, it adds: “We know that this crisis will have long lasting and widespread ramifications with the potential impact on livelihoods as profound as the crisis itself. We know too that the only way we will get through this is if we build on the connections and community spirit we have nurtured in the last few months to build a kinder, compassionate, considerate world that can support each other through the years ahead.“Businesses have a key role to play and as business leaders we are committing ourselves to doing all that we can to be part of building closer communities to build broader prosperity for all.”The initiative has already won the support of the Premier League, Scouts, Girl Guiding, the Women\u0027s Institute and the British Paralympics Association.Dame Carolyn said: “Covid-19 has undoubtedly hit some in society much harder than others. As businesses we recognise that we have a responsibility to all the communities in which we operate.

As a teenager, Pugh wore tight braids, which originate from African culture.“She began to explain to me what cultural appropriation was, the history and heartbreak over how when black girls do it they’re mocked and judged, but when white girls do it, it’s only then perceived as cool,” Pugh wrote to her 1.5million followers.She also explained that at the time, she was defensive about the issue, which she said she now recognises as an indicator of her own “white fragility”.In her statement she also revealed that one of her fans criticised her on Instagram for appropriating Rastafarian culture as a 17-year-old.“At the time I honestly did not think that I was doing anything wrong,” she said. “Growing up as white and privileged allowed me to get that far and not know.”Her comments come at a time when businesses are being rebranded and historic monuments and statues are being reconsidered in light of their controversial links to the colonial past.Pugh also explained how she befriended a shop owner when she was eight-years-old who taught her how to apply henna.“There wasn’t a summer where I didn’t henna my hands, feet, my family’s hands and feet, my friends – I was obsessed,” she wrote.However she went on to write that in 2017, when henna and bindis “became a trend” she was annoyed that “a culture was being abused for profit”.“And here’s the problem. I wasn’t actually being respectful in how I was using it. I wore this culture on my terms only, to parties, at dinner. I too was disrespecting the beauty of the religion that had been taught to me those years ago.”Pugh ended her statement with another apology: “I cannot dismiss the actions I bought into years ago, but I believe that we who were blind to such things must acknowledge them and recognise them as our faults, our ignorance and our white privilege and I apologise profusely that it took this long.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers accused trying hoodwink peers dropping plan block","story":"Ministers have been accused of trying to hoodwink peers into dropping a plan to block Huawei from the UK’s 5G network.Tory rebels in the House of Lords are today hoping to amend a Government Bill by banning firms that have poor human rights records from investing in broadband.They need Labour peers to join them to stand any chance of success, but claim the Government is trying to persuade Labour to stand down by making a promise it does not intend to keep.The row centres around the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill which regulates the installation of broadband in leasehold flats.If the amendment is passed it would create a human rights threshold for firms that bid for the right to supply equipment for the UK’s 5G infrastructure - potentially blocking Huawei altogether.The Chinese firm has been accused of facilitating Beijing’s persecution of Uighur Muslims.Although Lords amendments can be overturned in the Commons, sources have suggested the Government would be unlikely to try to do so, as dozens of Tory MPs voted against the Bill in March, meaning Boris Johnson would be defeated if only a few more Tory MPs rebelled.The Government is trying to kill off the amendment by telling Labour peers they will have a better chance to address the human rights issue in another Bill, the more wide-ranging Telecommunications Bill, later in the year.But the crossbench peer Lord Alton of Liverpool, who is backing the amendment, last night claimed a minister had admitted there would not, in fact, be a chance to amend the later Bill.He said Baroness Barran, the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport minister in the Lords, had told him the Telecommunications Security Bill had been drafted in such a way that human rights issues would not be “in scope”.He said: “I was so taken aback when I heard that that I wrote to the minister afterwards and included it in the note, which she later confirmed was correct.“It means there is even more reason for using this smaller bill tomorrow as a launchpad for raising this issue of human rights.”Writing on the  website, Lord Alton, together with Tory peer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, Labour peer Lord Adonis and crossbencher Baroness Falkner of Margravine, writes: Given all that we now know, the question for Parliament is whether it is willing to turn a blind eye and let Huawei march on regardless.  5G is a gamechanger, and our citizens need to know that we are protecting them.Ministers are hoping that Labour peers will vote against the amendment on the grounds that it will delay the roll-out of broadband in rented flats.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader who was one of the Tory MPs who rebelled when the Bill was in its Commons stages, urged all peers to back the amendment, saying: “This amendment is needed because it’s still not clear what the Government intends to do about Huawei.“Labour should vote for this otherwise they will be voting against human rights protection.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new royal yacht britannia would serious benefit uk says new","story":"A new Royal Yacht Britannia would be of serious benefit to the UK and its image, the deputy prime minister of New Zealand has said.Winston Peters, also the country\u0027s foreign minister, said a new vessel would boost links between the UK and the Commonwealth.In an interview with Chopper\u0027s Politics podcast, which you can listen to on the audio player above or subscribe to for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your podcast app, he said: From a New Zealand perspective, there is a chance it would be of serious benefit to the UK and its image.It makes sense in a modern context to not just have a maritime asset for the Royal Family – it can be a maritime asset used by the Royal Family but, when it is not being used, doing some serious work for spreading brand Britain around the world.Critics of plans for a new royal yacht argue that the estimated £100 million cost is too much.Mr Peters said: I can see what the problems might be with the politics, but if you see the positive side of it as a chance to broadcast, demonstrate and project Britain\u0027s image in terms of medicines and health, you can turn a negative very quickly into a serious positive. That is where it will work.But he ruled out Commonwealth nations paying for a new yacht, saying: In terms of value for your brand, you will get your money back. In these Covid-19 troubled economic times, I don\u0027t think taking the hat around the Commonwealth is a very good idea.Mr Peters said he was optimistic for the UK as it leaves the European Union at the end of this year, adding: When you look at it, in the end the EU still needs Britain, needs them seriously.But it enables the UK... not in its economics but in terms of its political reach to be globalist. Those are the facts. This is a chance to reconnect with some serious emerging economies, and the EU connection would not have allowed that.The Commonwealth had a real chance to step up and became a framework for global trade among its members, he said, adding: I believe so – when countries like India get to understand as an emerging economy of 1.4 billion people that it is in their interests to be part of a wider association, it gives us great leverage to facilitate the opportunities and strengths of different sectors in all of our countries.We will do better by all doing better trade together.The Royal Yacht Britannia, now a visitor attraction in Edinburgh, was controversially decommissioned in 1997.The  has been campaigning for a new privately-funded replacement for the past four years.  A secret naval design for a £100 million new Britannia was drawn up by naval staff at the time and approved by representatives of the Royal Family, but the Labour Government refused to pay for it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no thing cultural appropriation","story":"Honed by months of waiting, my post-lockdown fantasy has now become highly specific. I want a quiet table in the corner of the Kennington Tandoori. I want a nice lamb rogan josh and a bottle of Château Musar. And I want to be left alone. But left alone I will not be, especially if I am foolish enough to take my phone – and thus Twitter – with me. Because the recipe has become the newest battleground over claims of cultural appropriation.New York Times food columnist and Bon Appétit magazine writer Alison Roman is the latest to fall foul of the social justice police. She stands accused, amongst other heinous sins, of making a curry without properly crediting its cultural provenance. Bon Appétit’s research director was forced to step in to apologise for “decontextualising recipes from non-white cultures”. On this side of the pond, meanwhile, BBC Good Food is busy reviewing its vast archive of recipes, removing or amending any exhibiting unacceptable “broad-brush” language, such as “Asian salad”.Oh, for goodness sake. What next? Perhaps my love of a good curry and Lebanese red wine – both obvious candidates to be cancelled, both clearly in need of emergency decolonising? After all, it was empire that brought the curry to Britain, and French winemaking to the Beqaa Valley.But cultural appropriation is, of course, a nonsense criticism. All cultures weave in and out of each other and that of their neighbours. There are no pure origins, none hermetically sealed to the outside. In their glorious recipe book Jerusalem, Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi argue “the complexity and vibrancy of the food in Jerusalem stems from its location as a meeting point between Europe, Asia and Africa and the incredible richness of its history”. Go back far enough, and everything is fusion. Cultural appropriation is a weirdly negative way of describing something that is essentially a jolly good thing: learning from each other.No, that doesn’t mean that it is fine to take aspects of another culture and hold them up to ridicule. But we need not invent new moral categories to find blackface unacceptable or even to criticise those who borrow from another person’s sacred scriptures to create an exotic looking tattoo. Such things are already covered by the ideas of respect and stupidity, respectively.Yet some people just cannot help themselves. Writing in the latest edition of Bon Appétit, Joseph Hernandez turns the lens upon his own magazine, believing some deep moral blasphemy has been committed by the author of a recipe for the Filipino dessert halo-halo that included the very un-Filipino ingredients of gummy bears and popcorn. “What it normalises is a white culture,” he writes, “that sees everything foreign to it as a spectacle, something to be tamed and translated to an audience that can’t understand it.” Needless to say, Hernandez argues that these recipes must fall. And that – my translation here – our taste buds require decolonialising.Woke is a merciless philosophy. It specialises in sniffing out people’s moral failings in the smallest of things, imagining that the slightest slip must indicate some profound or pernicious inner prejudice. The ludicrous thing is that it often misses – or deliberately seeks to avoid – deeper moral issues. For instance, instead of gummy bears, he could have mentioned that sugar itself was the white gold powering the slave trade addiction to sweet desserts tempted many of our ancestors to turn a blind eye to the evils of slavery.Yet the micro-aggressions of misplaced gummy bears are the least of their worries over at Bon Appétit. Last month, the editor-in-chief resigned after a photograph surfaced on social media showing him dressed up for a Hallowe’en party in some apparently hilarious parody of a Puerto Rican gangster, complete with a heavy fake tan. He had just written an earnest editorial about the need for the food industry to respond positively to the death of George Floyd. A few days later, he was accused by one of the Bon Appétit writers of discriminating against people of colour at work. He resigned soon after.If he was treating colleagues badly, then rightly so. But the accusation of cultural appropriation – as opposed to plain disrespect – is such an unhelpful addition to our moral vocabulary. Back in 2001, the then Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook famously praised the way in which chicken tikka masala had not only become our national dish but also “a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences”.Isn’t it telling how quickly public morality has shifted? These days, absorbing and adapting external influences is regarded as something shameful, insufficiently respectful of difference. But Cook was right.Learning from others is messy and complicated. It flows through war and trade, as well as love across cultural ides. And an adventurous and free-spirited cultural exchange may get things wrong all the time. But that is precisely how creativity works, and especially in the kitchen. Giles Fraser is a columnist at UnHerdMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"orwellian double think woke elite blinds ridiculousness","story":"With the Archbishop of Canterbury urging ecclesiastical iconoclasm with a vim not seen since the days of Thomas Cranmer, one could almost think the culture war’s excesses had lost their ability to shock. Yet last week produced two examples so blatant, so deranged and so shameless as to astonish even the most cynical observer.First, Cambridge University’s defence of Dr Priyamvada Gopal, a lecturer in postcolonial literature who sparked a (not unreasonable) public backlash after tweeting that “White lives don’t matter. As white lives”. Amid calls for her dismissal, Cambridge released a supportive message, apparently condemning “cancel culture” in all its forms:“The university defends the right of its academics to express their own lawful opinions which others might find controversial and deplores in the strongest terms abuse and personal attacks”.Noble sentiments indeed, but it also happens to be a lie – and one so barefaced that it would almost be funny if it weren’t so tragic.Under a “progressive” new vice chancellor, Cambridge has led the way in appeasing the outrage mob. It has singularly failed to defend conservative academics such as the sociologist Noah Carl – summarily dismissed after an open letter from faculty members accused him of racism. It took university authorities just 48 hours to rescind Jordan Peterson’s visiting fellowship, while the students’ union claimed his “work and views” were “not representative of the student body”. Curiouser and curiouser. In claiming to value free speech (but only for certain opinions) Cambridge is guilty both of double standards, and double-think.Similar sleight of mind can be seen in the tragicomical conduct of Booker Prize organisers, who sacked their long-time patroness Baroness Nicholson as honorary vice-president for the “crimes” of voting against gay marriage in 2013, believing in biological sex and “misgendering” someone on Twitter. An equally Orwellian statement followed:“We deplore racism, homophobia and transphobia, and do not discriminate on any grounds. Literature is open, plural and questioning. We believe every author’s work should be approached by readers in the same spirit.”No satire could match this delicious declaration of support for openness and plurality of opinion, while sacking someone people disagreed with. Like adults who wear Crocs in public, they seem to have forgotten that we can see them.The double-think is as unsurprising as it is flagrant. Once-niche “critical theory” has infiltrated contemporary discourse, with its rejection of logic, reason and objective reality. And revolutionaries always become what they claim to abhor, like the French radicals who repressed formal religion and ended up worshipping an amorphous Cult of Reason, and replaced the judiciary with “people’s courts”. Today, we are similarly discovering what atrocities may be committed under the guise of the Rights of Man.Dominating every major wing of cultural life, small wonder that the Left feels so comfortable in its exquisite hypocrisies. Influential appointments have the ring of a cosy, quasi-incestuous club, a conveyor belt of Left-wing opinion linking  editorships, heads of Oxbridge colleges, public health quangocrats and more. Readers may recall the popular game “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon”, in which film buffs challenge each other to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and the prolific Bacon. A colleague suggests a version for the quangocracy “Six Degrees of Shami Chakrabarti”.For how long can this state of affairs continue? Being obliged to parrot propaganda and declare the sky is pink to retain your livelihood is emotionally draining. Neither is it healthy for our institutions to be so consistently out of step with public opinion, overseen by a detached cultural elite that is only occasionally roused from its perch by a disobliging election or referendum result. Few of us wish to inhabit a monoculture, and the quality of artistic output is already suffering take the Booker Prize’s own deterioration in the literary landscape.Worst of all, it will destroy genuine progress. In liberal California, presumably to pave the way for “affirmative action” measures, the legislature has just voted to strike anti-discrimination commitments from its constitution – a development that should terrify all thinking people. Britain is never far behind America and already ours is a topsy-turvy world, in which bullies feign victimhood, discrimination masquerades as social justice and “feminist” activists use the mantle of progressivism to hound women with impunity.

The Mayor, Bert Biscoe, said it is hoped the measures will encourage local residents to “return as much as possible, and to encourage others to come as well”.The pedestrianisation of some of England\u0027s most popular tourist destinations come as Airbnb told the  that daily domestic bookings on its platform in the UK doubled from Monday to Tuesday.  Furthermore, it said that there had been more UK domestic bookings made between June 21 and June 23 than there were in the entire month of April.Bookings are only likely to increase after the government gave permission for people in England to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation from July 4.  It followed the announcement that thousands of pubs and restaurants can reopen across the country on the same day.Like in Cornwall, destinations around the country are pedestrianising in anticipation of the influx.North Tyneside Council sent a letter to local residents last week, informing them of proposals to close a number of streets with “a challenging combination of narrow footpaths, small premises and high demand” from July 1 - in time for the start of the busy summer season.  They include Park View in the seaside town of Whitley Bay and North Shields Fish Quay.Meanwhile in East Anglia, Norfolk County Council has given local authorities permission to implement road restrictions in 13 towns until December next year, including Hunstanton, King’s Lynn and the popular coastal town of Cromer, according to the Eastern Daily Press.In Oxford, a one-way pedestrian flow system has been implemented on the city centre\u0027s busiest streets and the council is planning to widen cycle lanes and footpaths.  Similarly, Cambridge has widened footways and enforced pedestrian areas and one-way access to narrow passageways in the city centre.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"weddings september councils yet make venues covid secure1","story":"Couples dreaming of their big day thought that they had been saved. When news came through last week that weddings could go ahead from July 4 with a maximum of 30 attendees, many took the unenviable task of whittling down guests from hundreds to only a handful.Yet for those for whom lockdown and a global pandemic has made tying the knot all the more urgent, booking that special day may now be hampered once again by council red tape.After thinking they had been thrown an eleventh-hour lifeline, couples could still be forced to wait until September and beyond to start wedding plans as councils delay marriage applications.County councils that oversee registrar services at some of the UK’s most desirable wedding venues told the  that new bookings are on hold until September or even later.Boris Johnson announced last week that services including weddings can restart with a maximum of 30 people, subject to social distancing, from July 4.Oxfordshire County Council said they are taking a “phased approach” to reopening buildings, and“currently do not plan to take any bookings for ceremonies until after September 1.”Other councils have not committed to any date when bookings can recommence, meaning that people in North Yorkshire, Suffolk and Somerset will have to put their plans on ice for the foreseeable future.Wedding planners and venues told the  last night that at the beginning of the pandemic most of their clients pushed their weddings into next year.But new clients wishing to get married this year following the Prime Minister’s announcement may have to wait for months on end before confirming their wedding can go ahead.Katherine Daniel, who runs Little Quarme, a picturesque wedding venue in Somerset, told the : “All of our weddings for this year, we’ve reorganised other than two left in October.“Who knows what the decision will be on weddings later in the year.“Nobody has been able to commit to anything for the back end of this year as the registrars haven’t been in the position to confirm any weddings. We’ve had a lot of inquiries but they’ve not gone any further.“We’ve just got the risk assessment from Somerset registrars that we have to get back to them.”Hannah Redeyoff from Doncaster had finally been given the go ahead to marry her partner this coming Saturday. She told BBC Radio 4:“We were planning on getting married at the church we both go to and Stephen has gone to since he was born, and dad was going to do the ceremony and walk me down the aisle.“We’d planned quite a big wedding with 92 guests in the day, going up to 120 a night.“As soon as lockdown happened we thought maybe we’d be able to go ahead or our original date on 27 June, but we didn’t anticipate how big it would be, and about a month ago we realised it wasn’t going to happen.“10 days to plan a new wedding when we were planning one for over a year isn’t a lot of time.“We can have the organist play for me and Stephen coming in, but no hymns.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/04/14/jay-z.jpg","title":"beyonce black is king trailer disney plus the lion king watch","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Visual album is described as ‘a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience’Disney Plus has announced a new film from Beyoncé, which was influenced in part by her work on Disney’s reboot of The Lion King.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”Speaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”The labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the early days, we were getting all sorts of combinations of swabs and samples, it was ironed out but that did delay things. You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said spreading out the labs as opposed to centralising testing was easier, logistically, and meant faster results.Alongside the mass testing he said any positive result was communicated to local health authorities immediately, initially by phone, though the system is now automated.“We were the laboratory who picked up the first two cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that’s the state in the northeast,” Hefel said. ”We reported at four o’clock on the results and two hours later it was in the media. In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The lost item posed no risk to the astronauts, spacewalk or the station, Nasa said.Nasa renaming headquarters in honour of first black female engineerSpacewalking astronauts wear a wrist mirror on each sleeve to get better views while working. The mirror is just 5 inches by 3 inches, and together with its band has a mass of barely one-tenth of a pound.Cassidy and Bob Behnken, who followed him out without mishap, were conducting the first of at least four spacewalks to replace the last bunch of old station batteries.Once the six new lithium-ion batteries are installed, the orbiting lab should be good for the rest of its operational life, according to NASA. The big, boxy batteries — more powerful and efficient than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries coming out — keep the station humming when it\u0027s on the night side of Earth.The battery replacements began in 2017, with previous crews putting in 18 lithium-ion batteries, half as many as the old ones replaced.Cassidy and Behnken have six more to plug in before the job is complete. It\u0027s cumbersome work: Each battery is about a yard (meter) tall and wide, with a mass of 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Their spacewalks are expected to continue through July before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Pegg, who has been working with 56 Black Men’s Cephas Williams to help create opportunities for black actors, writers and directors, said it was time for change.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The film industry would be such a healthier, more interesting place if there were more voices, different stories, different experiences.,” he said. “It’s so dominated by one particular voice and colour of face, it just perpetuates a bland mono-voiced cultural landscape,” he continued. Beyonce surprises fans with trailer for new film Black is KingSacha Baron Cohen ‘crashed far-right event disguised as singer’Pegg said it was “alarming” that Lost Transmissions, his new film, is the first feature-length project he has appeared in that was directed by a woman, Katharine O’Brien.“In 20 years of filmmaking!” he commented. “How alarming is that?”Lost Transmissions follows a songwriter searching for her missing colleague, a producer who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. It will be available from 29 June. The Black Lives Matter protests that followed the killing of George Floyd have sparked calls for radical change in the entertainment industry. The BBC recently pledged £100m to a scheme aimed at increasing its production of “inclusive and erse content”.As part of this commitment, the BBC has also pledged that from April 2021, 20 per cent of all “talent” on and off screen will come from a erse background, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME), socioeconomic or disability ersity.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

I was stressed.\u0026nbspWhen I tried to tell them I had been tortured, the interviewer didn’t ask me any other questions about it or try and find out about what had happened to me,’ says asylum seeker Isaac“As soon as we got into the room I felt as though I wasn’t welcome,” says Isaac*, an asylum seeker from Central Africa, as he remembers his interview with the Home Office three years ago. The young man, who was claiming asylum on the grounds that he was tortured in his home country for attending anti-government protests, had been nervous before arriving at the interview. He quickly discovered the process was even more nerve-racking than he had feared.“It wasn’t an interview – it was an interrogation,” he says. “To me, an interrogation is just when you are interviewing a criminal, and someone who has committed a crime.”The Home Office caseworker asked Isaac more than 300 questions over four hours, yet he recalls that he wasn’t offered any water: “My throat was dry. I was stressed. I’m not used to cold, and it was cold at the time. All of these things definitely had an impact on my interview.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIsaac, who is in his early thirties and was a businessman in his home country, was subsequently refused asylum, and is now awaiting a decision on his appeal.He is one of 30 survivors of torture whose asylum case files have been reviewed as part of new research into the experience of the asylum interview for torture survivors seeking asylum in the UK. The report, by charity Freedom from Torture, concludes that the Home Office repeatedly breaches its own guidelines during asylum interviews and “lets down many of those it is supposed to protect”.Surge in asylum seekers waiting longer than half a year for decision Home Office contractor admits it put vulnerable asylum seekers at riskMore than half of immigration and asylum appeals are now successful, official figures show, with more than 23,000 people seeing their refusals overturned after appealing decisions in the 12 months to March last year, prompting concern about asylum decision making – and the quality of the interviews.Transcripts of Isaac’s interview, seen by The Independent, show that he brought up his experience of torture a number of times, but that the caseworker didn’t follow up on these disclosures.At one point, on being asked where he was taken after being arrested, Isaac said: “Everyone started beating and started asking questions and telling me I was the one who was inciting, propagating insurrection” – but the caseworker proceeded to ask only how many people were present. Later on in the interview, Isaac stated that he “received torture and beating” while detained, and then goes on to explain that someone helped him clean the wound he obtained from this, but the caseworker at no point in the interview asked for further detail about his experience of torture.Describing the line of questioning, Isaac says: “When I tried to tell them that I had been tortured, the interviewer didn’t ask me any other questions about it or try and find out about what had happened to me.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It makes it impossible to give the right information that they need.”The findings of Freedom from Torture’s report, based on reviews of transcripts of asylum interviews carried out by the Home Office in 2017 or 2018 and a series of focus groups and interviews involving 25 torture survivors who had attended asylum interviews, shows they were often prevented from giving a full account of their experiences or denied the opportunity to explain their evidence.Majority of immigration appeals against Home Office now successfulThe report states that some Home Office case workers were found to employ “poor questioning technique” and were “likely to default to disbelieving the survivor” during the interviews, with sensitivity and professional approach to claimants “not always maintained”.One excerpt from a transcript included in the report reveals that a caseworker asked a claimant whether they were raped, to which the claimant responded: “Yes, beaten and raped and left naked, I don’t like to think about it,” and started to cry. The caseworker then immediately asked the asylum seeker: “How many times were you beaten and raped over the five days?” In other cases, asylum seekers spoke of male interpreters being allocated when a female interpreter had been requested, or allocation of an interpreter who spoke the incorrect dialect or poor English, making it more difficult for them to explain their account fully to the caseworker.Ahmad, from the Middle East, meanwhile describes having to explain being tortured for freedom of expression in his home country through an interpreter who he said couldn’t speak a high standard of English.“Imagine trying to explain that there had been a massacre, and your translator having to search for the appropriate word on Google,” he says. “I can speak some English, and when I heard the interpreter translating my words wrong, I would try to speak for myself, but the interviewer kept on telling me to answer in Arabic for the translator.Windrush report finds“I tried to explain that I needed to speak for myself as the interpreter was not saying what I was saying, but I was silenced. Worse yet, between the agonising misinterpretations – they didn’t even get to the bottom of my story.”Ahmad was initially refused asylum, but was granted on appeal. He has now completed a master’s and plans to become a pharmacist.He adds: “My application was denied because of the issues with my interpreter. When I saw what the Home Office thought my story was, it was completely wrong. The interpreter had mistranslated my story into a different version of the truth.”Sonya Sceats, chief executive of Freedom from Torture, said the report’s findings shone a light on the Home Office’s “culture of disbelief” in the wake of the Windrush Lessons Learned Review – which attributed the Windrush scandal in part to a “culture of disbelief and carelessness” in the department – and called for fundamental culture changes in the system.“It is yet another illustration of how a system corrupted by a culture of hostility and exclusion contributes to the misery and desperation of people in need of help. There have been glimmers of light and an acknowledgement of the need for change. But strong action is essential,” she said.“In the context of a powerful movement for race equality and in the face of evidence showing the harmful impact on vulnerable people, the Home Office can no longer turn a blind eye to the injustice and hostility hardwired into the asylum system.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People visit Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire, that recently reopened following the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictionA protest for Justice for Shukri Abdi on Trafalgar Square in London, following a raft of Black Lives Matter protests  across the UKPolice at the scene of an incident at the Park Inn Hotel in central Glasgow.

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline. Former Love Island contestant Joshua Ritchie, who was allegedly among those who turned up at the beach, was seen carrying a large speaker with friends in a video.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman declined to comment on particular scenes on beaches, but told reporters: “The prime minister and the government’s scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.“It is only due to the public’s hard work that we have been able to bring the virus under control, and if the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will have to look at having to reverse some of the easements that have been put in place and I don’t think anyone in the British public would want that to happen.”There were hundreds of kids grouped up on the Roath Park Rec earlier this evening. They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort. She said: “Double honour — to be a face in Peter Blake’s awesome collage for the Mandarin and to be a tiny part of helping Help the Hungry. It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry. I can’t be more honoured.”The piece was originally commissioned by London Advertising, whose founder Michael Moszynski said: “We’re looking forward to seeing the final figures raised.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.The task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The new coalition government in Ireland is facing criticism for its failure to bring in voices from Northern Ireland, despite a commitment towards building a ‘shared island’.After being elected Taoiseach on Saturday, Micheal Martin had the opportunity to nominate 11 personal choices to the Seanad – Ireland’s upper house. But despite expectations, no one from Northern Ireland made the cut.Whilst there is no obligation for such representation, the apparent oversight is particularly jarring because of the new coalition’s promise to improve cross-border integration. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe programme for government agreed by Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Greens outlined plans for a new unit within the office of the Taoiseach “to work towards a consensus on a shared island,” in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement.The move can be read as a response to growing demand across the island of Ireland for a discussion about the constitutional future of Northern Ireland, particularly in the wake of Brexit – which will leave the region more closely aligned to Dublin and the rest of the EU on trade. The coronavirus pandemic has also shown the importance of all-island co-operation on such matters.Micheal Martin becomes Ireland’s Taoiseach as new coalition is formedThe ‘shared island’ move also comes after Sinn Fein pledged to create a junior minister for Irish unity during an election in which that party made significant gains. While Mary Lou McDonald has called for a referendum on reunification within the next few years, an office planning for closer integration is much more in keeping with the ‘slow and steady’ approach to unity favoured by Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.While the Taoiseach’s appointment of new senators offered an early chance to begin cross-border outreach, critics have expressed disappointment at his failure to choose anyone from Northern Ireland – nationalist or unionist.Emma DeSouza, a Derry woman who has led a legal battle for the EU rights of citizens in Northern Ireland, had been among those considered for a post. She has expressed her disappointment on Twitter, saying, “the row-back on a Northern nomination immediately undercuts the concept of a shared island and will reignite fears that we in the North will be left behind, again.”Northern Ireland will have representation through elected Sinn Fein figures Elisha McCallion and Niall O’Donnghaile.

Jane Morrice is a unionist who was an architect of the Good Friday Agreement as part of the Women\u0027s Coalition, and later became Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. She has told The Independent that she contacted leaders in the Republic of Ireland offering herself to represent the North in the Seanad.I was hoping for a tap on the shoulder, says Morrice, but I failed to get any substantive replies.Given the unique moment in politics on the island, particularly with the emerging conversations on the Republic\u0027s relationship with the North, an opportunity has been missed to put into practice the Shared Island commitment. Instead, the 11 people chosen to join the new Seanad by the Taoiseach are largely failed Fianna Fail and Fine Gael candidates from February’s general election. However, the majority of choices were women, and the inclusion of activist Eileen Flynn – the first women from a traveller background ever to take such a seat – was roundly praised. “This is a historic day for Traveller women, for Travellers and Irish society,” said the Women’s Council of Ireland. “You will be an excellent voice for women’s rights and social justice.”The discussion around this issue in the past 24 hours is an indication that whatever the new Dublin government has planned for the ‘shared island’ element of this administration, it will be scrutinised carefully not just by Sinn Fein in opposition – but by nationalists and supporters of island-wide integration on both sides of the border.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Four mobile testing units have been deployed to the city in recent weeks and thousands of home testing kits have been made available. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is examining the legislation needed for a shutdown after the city reported  new cases in the fortnight to June , the Sunday Times reports.A source has told the paper Mr Hancock is considering all options to bring the flare-up under control. Home Secretary Priti Patel confirmed there will be support going into Leicester, including mobile testing and resources for the council, but did not comment further on what will happen next. It comes after food manufacturer Samworth Brothers confirmed that a handful of staff at its Leicester sandwich factory had contracted the deadly bug. Other cases have been reported at a Sainsburyaposs supermarket, according to the Sun, while five schools have also closed. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, said it was unavoidable for the government to look at ways to slow the spread of the virus in Leicester. Unfortunately the fact that the government is having to contemplate specic measures to control the spread of the virus in Leicester is now unavoidable in order to protect the rest of the country, he told the Sunday Times. Shadow Health Secretary and Leicester MP Jon Ashworth demanded clarity from the government. He told the Mirror: People in Leicester are deeply anxious. We need clarity from ministers about what is planned and locally we need resources to ensure everyone who needs a test can access one quickly. It’s take a whole week for ministers go provide the council with local data. This simply isn’t good enough. Speed is of the essence when dealing with this virus.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had already voiced concerns about the spike in cases in Leicester more than a week ago. He said on June : “Outbreaks are currently taking place in Leicester and Kirklees, where we have sent in mobile testing centres and we are working closely with local councils.” It is understood concerns have mounted in recent days amid a rise in new cases presenting in hospital. Concerns are centred around food processing plants and reports of crowding around some takeaways. One official did not rule out the city imposing local lockdown measures - but indicated they hoped any action would be more tightly targeted at the source. For example, outbreaks in Enfield and Weston-Super-Mare led to GP surgeries and the hospital closing rather than a widespread new lockdown. Itaposs understood a decision is yet to be taken. So far local action has been taken to lock down inidual hospitals and GP surgeries where there has been an outbreak but this situation is more serious than that, although no decision has yet been taken,” a source told the Sunday Times. And one local source suggested the city council knew nothing of a possible local lockdown until reading speculation from central government yesterday. Leicester’s elected City Mayor, Peter Soulsby, said yesterday the current reports of where the outbreak might be were “far too vague to be of any real use.” He added: “There are many dferent communities and neighbourhoods in that local government ward, and we have no way of knowing whichany of them are being adversely affected by the virus. “We’re getting that data now, we’re beginning to crunch that information, and hopefully within the next few days, we’ll be able to know what’s going on there -anything - andwe need to, intervene in the right neighbourhood with the right communities.” It comes as the number of deaths from coronavirus in the UK increased by  yesterday - the lowest Saturday increase in lockdown.

They added: Public hygiene is of the upmost importance, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, and enabling residents to access toilets safely is vital. Handwashing is an important activity to help prevent the spread of the virus.  Closed toilets may also impact disproportionately on certain groups who for health reasons rely on access to public toilets to be able to leave their homes. They can also make le dficult for young families and people who work outside. If you have toilets that are still shut, then we strongly urge you to refer to advice on measures that can be taken to open toilets in a safe way.

Some £billion in fresh money will be put towards  projects - some of which will break ground in September . The Department for Education was unable to confirm how many would be ready to start next year, saying more detail would be set out in the next spending review. Mr Johnson said: “All children deserve the best possible start in le – regardless of their background or where they live. “As we bounce back from the pandemic, it’s important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed, with our younger generations front and centre of this mission. “This major new investment will make sure our schools and colleges are fit for the future, with better facilities and brand new buildings so that every child gets a world-class education.” A further £m will be made available for school repairs this year. And £m will be available for repairs to FE colleges - money which had already been announced in the last Budget. The Prime Minister admitted that the closure of schools had been a massive problem with the majority closed since March with children instead being taught online. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has come under fire over the governmentaposs U-turn on more children ing to school before the summer.  Heaposs promised to get children back to school in September by doubling the -child limit on class sizes in primary schools and ditching requirements for teachers to enforce the new ‘one metre plus’ social distancing measure - which comes into effect from July . Mr Johnson took a swing at teaching unions and said those opposed to the wider reopening of schools should ‘take their responsibilities seriously’. He added: It’s the kids from the poorer families who aren’t going back, and so you are entrenching social injustice.

A further % want moderate changes - and just % want no changes at all. But some % of those polled were pessimistic when they think about the future of the economy. More than  business and community leaders have urged the government to create a fairer economy after Covid-. The ‘build back better’ group has called for a recovery plan that includes high-quality public services, good jobs, protection for the planet and a reduction in inequality. Frances O’Grady, General Secretary of the TUC, Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury, David Walker, Bishop of Manchester, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, Bishop of Dover, and Bob Kerslake, former head of the civil service all put their names to the demands - under the banner of ‘Build Back Better’. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This crisis has exposed huge inequalities in our labour market, with those in low-paid and insecure work forced to shoulder the most risk. “That is not right. We can’t afford another race to the bottom on pay and employment standards. We need a new economic settlement that creates decent jobs across the UK.” The survey found some % of Brits were in favour of the government creating jobs for those that have lost their work through the coronavirus crisis, with only % opposed. Some % of people backing more borrowing to fund public services. And a third of those polledsaid tackling climate change should be a priority now, alongside the coronavirus. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General of the CBI, said: “The last few months have taken a heavy toll on the economy and it’s now more important than ever that the country finds a way through COVID- which priorities jobs and training, for the young especially.  “For business, Building Back Better means working alongside all strands of civic society to create a jobs-rich, fair and sustainable future for our country.” Lord Bob Kerslake, former head of the civil service, said: “As the country begins to emerge from the crisis it is becoming clear that people want a better future, not simply toto where we were before. “As with big crises in the past – from wars to the Great Depression – it was universally agreed that there was no going back. “And so we have to ask deep questions about what kind of society and economy we now want to build. The moment we are in is a challenge to us all to governments, businesses, civil society and citizens. “But it is a challenge to which, together, we can rise and build something better.” Emma Revie, Chief executive at the Trussell Trust, said: “Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in the UK, more and more people have needed food banks – the number of families at food banks doubled in April this year compared to .

By instinct and action, Boris Johnson is a PM primarily for London – where he was mayor – and the English Home Counties, rather than the United Kingdom as a whole. Tories with seats in Labour’s so-called “red wall” are in a minority in a party funded by – and too often acting as the political wing of – wealthy speculators. The planning scandal involving Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick and Tory donor Richard Desmond is an insight into how the Conservatives do business, and that doesn’t bode well for Britain’s poorer areas. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham speaks for many in demanding deeds not words from Boris Johnson, who is spinning like a top before a big speech tomorrow. We’re watching you, Prime Minister. Insecure duo Boris Johnson showing the door to Whitehall mandarin and national security adviser Sir Mark Sedwill is the PM simply playing political games. The Tory leader and his privileged No henchman Dominic Cummings are focusing on a tiny part of London. They are a duo who put their own interests ahead of the national interest.  Appointing chief Brexit negotiator David Frost to the security brief smacks of a Margaret Thatcher-style “one of us” fixation within the Downing Street cabal, when the only priority should be what’s best for Britain. Who comes next will require close scrutiny when Johnson’s running another Tory “chumocracy”, with a contempt for democracy.

The UK government will this week give the green light to foreign holidays by lting its  day quarantine restriction on arrivals from parts of Europe. And travel websites crashed over the weekend after families hunted for bargain breaks abroad as Spanish tourist bosses face a race against time to open thousands of hotels after the surge in bookings. Robert Webster, , originally from Cheltenham, his we Annabelle, , and children Carla, , and Emily, , run Hotel Arce in Baiona, Galicia. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   They’re re-opening their doors for a very dferent tourist season - but Robert believes holidaying Brits will have a better time than ever. “We have one message to British tourists, and that is this: You can have a fantastic holiday, so get over here to Spain now...but make sure you pack your face masks, he said. There’s going to be a new normal when we fully reopen, but people coming to Spain will probably have a better holiday than any other year.  For there’s been so much attention to detail in all the good restaurants and hotels. And people are genuinely excited to be opening their doors again. It comes as passengers will be expected to wear a mask at the airports and on board flights, as well as being encouraged to check in luggage in order to stop the spread of the virus, under government guidance. While Brits arriving in the likes of holiday hotspot Benidorm will be met with miles of empty sands, will be expected to wear face coverings on the promenade and stick to social distancing rules. And nightclubbers must wear masks and dance in their own squares, with DJs confined to personal booths, according to proposed rules by Nightle Spain. Robert admitted the past few months have been tough but said they started the season with bookings right through to the first week of March.  While we were aware what was going on across the world, it didn’t seem to be affecting us, he continued. But on March  the city went into lockdown and we had  cancellations - for a -room hotel. We’ve been thinking how we are going to survive financially and have taken out a huge loan. Now there’s new tight protocols, nationally and regionally. We’ve removed all excess soft furnishings and replaced all decorative items, like pictures and ornaments.  We’ve made more room in the reception so people can keep further apart and when a customer leaves, every single thing in their room will be washed and disinfected. From last Monday, Robert was able to open his doors to Spanish guests, with the first family arriving that morning. It was absolutely lovely to see people here again, he continued. And it’s also given us a chance to practice the new cleaning protocols! He went on to say: For tourists, the only major dference will be having to wear a face mask when around other people. You can be fined  Eurosyou don’t. But as long as you do that, you’re very welcome. And there is nothing to stop you having a fantastic holiday and a relaxing time. Come to Spain! he added. But the vast majority of hotels in Spain’s holiday resorts are still boarded-up and empty in the wake of Covid-. They now have to restock bars and restaurants, rehire staff and prepare pools and bedrooms for guests. And visitors arriving in the country this week may struggle to find accommodationthey have not booked ahead. Raul Gonzalez, boss of the Barcelo hotel chain, the second biggest in Spain, has warned many of its rooms will not reopen until next year.  Around % of the firm’s  Spanish hotels are open, although more will start welcoming guests in the coming weeks. Mr González said: “There are hotels that we will not open until October and there will be others that we will not open at all.” Spanish tourist chiefs have also threatened to impose another ban on foreign holidaymakersthere is a surge in Covid- cases. The warning came just a week after the country opened its borders to European travellers.

Towns and cities across France, Spain and Portugal are begging for tourists to , as the Continent reopens to ­visitors after months of lockdown. With the Government due to announce the countries it has struck air bridge deals with on Wednesday, hoteliers, mayors and industry chiefs are begging Brits toto holiday hotspots this summer. Nicolas Langlois, the mayor of Dieppe, in Normandy, northern France, said: “The lack of people coming on ferries from England has had a major effect on our economy. From hotels, bars, restaurants and shops, we cannot wait until the Brits . Some businesses will close unless they come back very soon.” The town’s local paper last week had a headline saying, “We miss our dear Englishmen very much”, in a report about the struggling tourism industry. Ministers have yet to confirm which countries will form part of the air bridge system but Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Spain and Italy are expected to be included. A recent spike in Covid- infections in Portugal has ruled it out for the time being, while there is also uncertainty around Croatia, Turkey and Malta.  But Algarve industry chiefs in southern Portugal, are pleading for our . Eliderico Viegas, president of the Algarve’s Association for Hotels and Tourism, said: “The British are our main market. We are counting on them to rise to this new challenge and new opportunity.” Hoteliers in Spain, who have had swathes of cancellations due to the crisis, are urging us to fly out. The country is the most popular destination for Brits, with almost  million going each year. Expat Robert Webster, , runs Hotel Arce in Galicia, north-west Spain. Robert, from Cheltenham, said: “We have one message to British tourists – you can have a fantastic holiday, so get over here to Spain. People are genuinely excited to be opening their doors. For tourists, the only major dference will be having to wear a facemask when around other people.”  Britain’s largest independent travel agent, Hays Travel, reported a “flurry” of people booking foreign holidays since the air bridge plans were revealed. Owner Irene Hays said: “The phones have not stopped ringing. It has been remarkable.” TUI, Britain’s biggest tour operator, said: “We’re confident they’re now finalising air bridge agreements, which will effectively save summer for Brits.”Under the Government’s traffic-light air bridge system, countries will be rated green, amber or red, depending on the prevalence of coronavirus. The Government’s -day quarantine will be axed for countries rated green or amber. Home Secretary Priti Patel yesterday warned: “These measures won’t come in overnight. They will take time because some of this will be down to negotiation and discussion with certain countries.”Tour operators and airlines have already launched a price war to woo travellers.

Amjad Butt, , and his -year-old we Tina splashed out £, last year on the luxurious timber building in their garden in Iris Close, Bournville, Birmingham. But they have now been told the summerhouse contravenes local planning restrictions of the Bournville Village Trust as, at three metres tall, it is one metre too high. The couple now face having to take down the building - which they claim adheres to national planning laws - or radically slash its height and design. Tina, a retired nursing manager, said: We spent £, on the summerhouse, labour, paint and plants and now we don’t know what to do. We can’t enjoy it. The BVT said its aim was to work with householders who want to submit applications for alterations to their homes”. It added the couple had been invited to appeal against the summerhouse decision but had declined to do so.  Retired chartered accountant Amjad and his we had moved to Bournville from London six years ago to enjoy their retirement. Last year they bought the wooden summerhouse from manufacturers Forest and the building was erected at the bottom of their garden. Amjad said: Thelaw says a summerhouse can be four metres high and single storey and we have done everything to communicate with the Trust. It has been manufactured according toplanning laws. The law gave the permission to the industry for the dimensions that it can be four metres high. The manufacturer has used all those dimensions to manufacture it.  All you have to do is check a couple of things, for example the summer house must not take more than  per cent of your garden. So our garden is  feet, and this summer house has taken only  feet of the garden. The couple claim they thoroughly researched the planning laws around outbuildings and believed the trustaposs Bournville Design Guide rules related only to the main house. The BVT launched an investigation after receiving a complaint about the summerhouse from a neighbour.  Two officials made a site visit in October and the couple were later told the structure was one metre too high and contravened strict planning rules of the Bournville Design Guide. Amjad said he understood the BVT was there to protect the heritage of the area and ensure nothing is distorted or tampered with without the permission of the Bournville Trust. He said: That is their main role. But we have not touched our main house, the building.  It is only a summer house, or you could say a gloried shed at the back of the garden which has been put up strictly according to the law. Arthur Tsang, Director of Communities at Bournville Village Trust, said: We are sorry that Mr and Mrs Butt are unhappy with the handling of their application for a summerhouse. Our aim is always to work with customers who want to submit applications for alterations to their homes to make sure they meet the guidance in the Bournville Design Guide and are therefore successful. The Design Guide is partly in place to help manage the balance of buildings and green space that the area and people who live in Bournville enjoy and benefit from.

But Britain can prevent the national catastrophe of March and April recurring he said, however without core infrastructures in place then a very nasty rebound is likely in October and November. With second spikes of infection already in Europe, including Germany, Sir Jeremy said I think we will see rebounds in certain situations - pointing to the outbreaks in meat packing factories as an example. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    He also predicted that the UK could see a small increase in cases in the first week of July as lockdown eases. Speaking to the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, he said: The next three months are absolutely critical. “We’re on a kne edge. Sir Jeremy warned more people could lose their lives, particularlywe fail to learn the lessons from the spring. We have got to move ahead of the pandemic. Once you get behind it, you lose track of it - that’s what happened in the UK. We were too slow, the epidemic took off. It comes as crowds descended on beaches, including in Bournemouth, during last weekaposs heat wave and hundreds attended illegal raves in London over the weekend.  And Boris Johnson is preparing to reopen pubs, hotels, campsites, hairdressers, restaurants and churches in England from July . All pupils are also set to go back to school in September. The PM has said, meanwhile, there could be local lockdownsthe virus spikes - with health officials already closely monitoring an outbreak in Leicester. On reopening parts of the economy Sir Jeremy, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: There is no zero risk in any of this. We are not at the stage where the virus has disappeared. Try and stay outside, try and stay in small numbers. Donapost get caught indoors in large groups of people from large numbers of households. Sir Jeremy went on to say restrictions realistically were being lted towards the end of May and early June and he expects more cases by the first week of July as a result. Weaposre on a kne edge, itaposs very precarious the situation, particularly in England at the moment, and I would anticipate we would see an increase in new cases over the coming weeks, he said.

But after his trip to Chessington Zoo he said it is safe to say that post-lockdown zoo days at the theme park belong like its animals on the day - firmly in the shade. The unenviable depressing milestone of  days of being in lockdown was fast approaching for Matt and the screams for some sense of normality were getting louder. When Chessington announced it would be reopening its zoo, an audible gasp rumbled throughout his home. But Surrey Liveaposs content editor Matt has described his experience in an opinion piece...  The mundane trudge of a daily . hour sht of sitting on a wooden chair, with my back creaking, at my dining room table, where the memory of weekends had evaporated, would at last be broken. We could finally have a family day out. The relief I felt was more for my -month-old son, as I am sure he was becoming increasingly puzzled as to why his father was spending more time looking at a rectangular bright screen than playing with him. No sooner than it was announced had we swtly, and quite easily, booked our tickets through the website. The empty calendar and crossed out planned events ruined by the coronavirus pandemic finally had a new entry June  - Chessington. The day out The day had finally arrived. A Wednesday, but by now Wednesday meant as much to me as any other day. It didnapost matter, and the sunaposs blistering heat, which was causing the mercury to edge towards C, only added to our enthusiasm. With the theme park just a  minute drive from our house in Dorking, we decided it was best to head out in the afternoon after our toddler had had his nap and had a full stomach. Our entry into Chessington felt like any other time we had gone - until the barrier lted. Cones taped together direct you, and red signs with bold white letters tell you to remain in your car where you will be temperature checked before being allowed to enter a car park.  All seemed clear and simple, but that was as much clarity we were greeted with throughout our day and the waters would become murkier with each added confusion. If youaposre missing the thrill of the rides, then the journey to the car park takes on its own epic route, though itaposs lacking in any exhilaration. We passed two unmanned empty tents and muttered to each other that surely this is where the temperature checks are supposed to take place  With no-one in sight we continued our circuitous drive before alarmingly ending up at the exit barrier. A security guard came to our aid and they seemed more in shock that we were arriving at pm rather than how we had become lost.  We were kindly ushered into a near barren car park, with just a littering of cars cowering in the shade, used by Merlin annual passholders. The bumpy start to our family trip was not going to dampen our suncreamed bodies, and we excitedly made our way up to the entry gates where the promised temperature checks were painlessly conducted by a PPE-kitted staff member. Bag checks done, we entered the eerily quiet theme park, but with the added plus that there were no queues. We were handed a leaflet explaining what was open, and informed of one eatery offering food that wasnapost listed, as well as some handy safety tips as you make your way around the apparent one-way system. One thing is for sure, you canapost walk five metres without being met by a hand sanitiser dispenser, and signs telling you to clean your paws and to keep two metres apart.  A day that promised so much but delivered as much entertainment as the Star Wars prequel trilogyapos The one-way system starts in Wanyama Village, and unless youaposre equipped with an inbuilt GPS or are a frequent visitor of the park, finding it is an added frustration. After we walked through the Rainforest where the promise of tortoises was unfulfilled, we had to ask a friendly staff member to point us in the right direction. It was here, too, where the unlisted food outlet was supposed to be bustling. Instead, the shutters were pulled down with only the sad existence of a lonely barrier strap as evidence that it had been open. We hastily found the Wanyama Village and were guided by painted yellow arrows on the floor, and passed numerous hand sanitiser dispensers and one-way system signs - as, confusingly, some families walked the other way. It was only when we reached the enclosure where we were greeted by the magnicent sight of giraffes, zebras, and ostriches meandering in the field that we understood why people were walking against the one-way system, as there was an exit only sign directing to where we had just come from.  The two metre social distancing guidelines were also impossible to adhere to as you made your way up the ramp to overlook the vast enclosure, as, as expected, this is where most people were congregating. After much pointing and with our anxiety levels heightened having come in close contact with other humans, we descended before continuing on the one way route. Meerkats, Ankole Cattle, Bolivian Squirrel Monkeys, Sea Lions, and of course the Humboldt Penguins easily became the highlight, but it was to the Trail of the Kings and the anticipation of seeing the Asiatic Lions and Western Lowland Gorillas that topped our list. Not for the first time, locating it was another matter. Having sought the guidance from another helpful staff member, we made our way to our highlighted destination where it was prewarned that limited capacity was in operation. There was no need to worry about the number of people, as pretty much like the visible guidance, it was minimal. Indeed, one employee told us the area had a capacity for  but at one point it only had eight people. Any hopes our trip would suddenly springboard onto an upward trajectory were dashed in an instant, as we walked the past the squeaky clean windows with only vegetation to look at. No doubt the hot weather had caused the wild animals to shy away, although we did see a lonely gorilla scratching his head.  "},{"url":null,"title":"driver left trapped inside land","story":"NewsDriver left trapped inside Land Rover after major crash with London fire engineThe London fire engine was on a blue light call at the time of the collision, with the driver needing to be cut from a Land Rover on Streatham High RoadShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsRTA with fire engine - A with Stretham Common junction...

Twelve hours. That’s how quickly we need results of swab tests to make the track and trace programme work and set us free from lockdown.  At the present time, NHS results can take anything from  hours to five days, sometimes  days. No tracing system can work with such delays. Contacts have escaped. We’ll never get out of lockdown at that rate. I didn’t seek the antibody test. I had to attend a clinic for something  and I was offered one. Why not I thought I had no expectations of the test and,anything, I thought it wouldbe negative. The doctor who phoned me Saturday morning with the result was quite excited. “At your age and with your comorbidities you must be fit and strong. Your immune system must be cast iron.” My comorbidities are atrial  fibrillation , pulmonary fibrosisand borderline renal – all being treated and stable. They don’t bother me.

Being pregnant when she was diagnosed was a double blow but she protected our son for as long as she could, even though she was in pain.

Leanne died on June  leaving Jamie heartbroken, but he says her legacy will live on in their children. Now Jamie said he is battling on and would like to thank everyone for their support during Leanneaposs illness and after her death including those who donated to a fund-raiser which helped towards Leanne’s treatment.

This is one of the reasons many people ‘fall off the wagon’ and this can leave us feeling guilty, often leading to yo-yo dieting.” Research by ­Slimming World and the University of Leeds showed a diet based on low energy dense foods – foods that contain fewer calories per gram – such as fruit and veg, lean meat and rice, allows people to reduce calories while eating more, not less, and is more effective for weight-loss than calorie-counting. Carolyn adds: “By filling up on low energy dense foods, people can feel more satisfied and lose weight so they are able to stay on track.” These delicious recipes show how, with Slimming World’s Food Optimising plan, you can lose weight and not go hungry. Explaining energy density Gram for gram, low energy dense foods contain fewer calories than high energy density foods, so people are able to eat a larger volume of food for the samecalorie intake, leading them to feel much fuller. For example, someone would have to eat around g of carrots to consume  calories, whereas it would take just g of chocolate to achieve a similar calorie intake, yet the greater volume of carrots is likely to make you much fuller.

The savvy office administrator spent just £ after watching inspiration videos on Instagram, Manchester Evening News reports.Dawn told money-saving community LatestDeals : I have always followed ious home accounts on Instagram and love nothing more than to look at ious images online for decorating ideas and DIY.I wanted my garden to look dferent and I had noticed a few people who were stencilling paths and patios. I wanted to take the inside outside and at the same time create a space that anyone would love to sit in.Lockdown came and for the first couple of weeks I was just baking nearly everyday to keep myself occupied. The weather became brighter and warmer and I thought aposright, now is the time to transform my -year-old yardapos.”For Dawn, being on furlough was the ideal opportunity for an intricate project. “I told my family I wanted to transform my yard, but didnapost go into detail as I wanted to surprise them, she said. I also told a few close friends and shared my ideas with them, and they inspired me to just go for it - they couldnapost have been more supportive throughout the whole process. Dawn used two five litre tins of smooth masonry paint, one black and one white, from BQ and The Range, which cost £.. She then bought one ml tin of Frenchic Al Fresco Dusky Blush from her local stockist Drab to Fab by Janey Home Interiors for £.. Dawn also used Thompsons Patio  Driveway Sealer from Screwfix for £., one Victorian tile stencil from idealstencils for £. plus postage, one stipple brush from BQ for £., and also ious makeup and children’s paintbrushes from around the house. The total cost of all the materials was £.. Dawn explained: “To prep, I jet washed the walls and floor. I painted the walls using the smooth black and white masonry paint and gave the floor two coats of smooth black masonry paint.  “I then took the edging stencil and went around the wall and across the middle of the yard, stippling the smooth white masonry paint with a brush. Once the edging was in place, I measured across the yard to find the top centre point. I always remembered the guy who laid my flooring in my kitchen saying aposyou start in the middle and work your way out’. I then measured across the yard in between the two edging stencilled tiles and immediately under the top stencilled edging tile to find the centre point. I marked this with chalk. I then placed the top centre point of the main stencil on the middle marked point on the floor. I stencilled that tile using the white masonry paint and the Frenchic Al Fresco Dusky Blush, and again stippled this with the brush. After stencilling that tile, I did one either side, all the way down, which left the edges on both sides. I then went back up to the top right and stencilled all the way down following the pattern, and the same for the left.

The Village Bar Cafe at Killay Precinct, Swansea, opened at reduced hours on June , allowing people to buy takeaway drinks. But local residents have expressed their concerns after noticing anti-social behaviour at night.The issue has intimidated residents and made pensioners scared to go shopping, Wales Online reports.  The baraposs owner, Martyn Jenkins, said the venue operated within the current coronavirus guidelines and that local authorities and businesses supported their decision to open.He said the trial opening aimed to bring le in the area and the business back to normal. However, following the concerns raised by local residents about the number of people gathering in Killay Square, Mr Jenkins said the trial opening has not turned out as we planned. The bar has now stopped trading at weekends. One local resident said he saw no social distancing when he was around the area with his daughter at around pm on Friday, June . He said: I was walking past Killay Square with my -year-old at around .pm on Friday. There must have been hundreds of people talking and drinking beer. Many of them were in their s and unlikely to be from the same family. There was no social distancing at all. It was quite a scary experience for my daughter. On a normal day during lockdown youaposd see three or four people at the square max. I feel for the older people trying to get essentials at the Co-op. The queue for the shop, because of social distancing, backs onto the square. Another resident said she saw men urinating on walls in the area and said it was not very pleasant for adults or children in the area. Councillor for Killay South, Jeff Jones said he will be taking part in discussions with local businesses and PCSOs to seeanything more can be done to allow businesses to trade without impacting negatively on locals. He said: We have been inundated - absolutely inundated with complaints. They reopened a few weeks ago and there were problems from the start. The police have attended every week. The Village has confirmed it is operating within the guidelines. The issue is that with it, there are repercussions.  There is still supposed to be social distancing, but people might be standing too close to each other. It is also the only bar in the area to have opened, so they may be getting customers from other venues. Killay is a lovely area with a very low level of crime. There are a lot of elderly people in the area and the last thing they want is to squeeze past lots of people who are drinking to get where they need to go. The other problem is, when there is drinking, people need to urinate. There are no public toilets open and people might instead urinate on the street. We understand that venues might need to operate so we will be discussing how we might be able to improve the situation. Owner Mr Jenkins apologised to anyone who felt uncomfortable following the baraposs opening despite their efforts to encourage social distancing and to keep disruption to a minimum. The bar had been opening for three hours between pm and pm on Thursdays and Fridays and for four hourson Saturday to prevent crowds and anti-social behaviour at night. [On Friday, June ] we took the decision not to re-open as a take-away and have advised licensing. We are a small independent family business and it was not our intention to cause an adverse effect on our local community and we apologise to anyone who while using the precinct has felt uncomfortable, said Mr Jenkins. In addition to local authorities, we notied the owners of the precinct itself and local shop keepers - all were supportive as they recognised the benefit of having people use the precinct. We display clear signage regarding social distancing, advise everyone who purchases a drink to comply with this, regularly walk around the precinct to enforce distancing and clear away any mess.

Renowned photographer Rankin, who has previously shot the Rolling Stones, Kate Moss and the Queen, offered to take portraits of  people playing a vital role in the NHS response to Covid-. The collection will be showcased across the country at bus stops, roadside billboards and iconic pedestrian areas, including the world-famous Piccadilly Lights in central London this week to mark the nd anniversary of the NHS.British photographer and director Rankin said: As the coronavirus pandemic began to unfold, I was moved by the incredible efforts of people across the NHS and I wanted to document who they are and their role in fighting this disease.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Taking a portrait is a unique and intimate experience, even with social distancing in place. Everyone had their own inspiring story which to them was just doing their job. I hope these images portray the resilience and courage they show every day in the face of real adversity.” Those photographed include an ICU consultant, a Covid- critical care nurse, a midwe, a psychiatrist, a hospital porter, a Covid- ward cleaner, a paramedic, a GP, a pharmacist, a district nurse, a  call centre worker, and a Chief Information Officer.  All have played a vital role in managing the response to the virus and supporting people impacted by the disease. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive, said: This has been the most challenging year in the NHS’s history, with our amazing staff providing care to almost , hospitalised Covid patients, and many more in the community. Nurses, doctors, physios, pharmacists, cleaners and countless others have pulled together, bolstered by thousands of former NHS staff who came back to help, alongside a new generation of students who stepped up.As we approach the NHS’s anniversary, these striking portraits pay tribute to all NHS staff and their extraordinary dedication. On July  we also want to say thank you to those from all walks of le who have played their part in helping the NHS and our communities deal with this unprecedented health emergency. The participants have been photographed unhidden by PPE, to reveal the people behind the masks and celebrate the iniduals they are.Alongside each portrait, NHS staff have shared their own personal stories from the frontline, providing aunique and touching insight into the lives of the people who are battling this pandemic and saving lives.Emma Kelly, a critical care nurse at the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said: At first, I thought it must be the wrong Emma as I feel like I’m just doing the job I’ve been trained to do. While all of us who work for the NHS do the job because we want to care for and support our patients – it is lovely to be recognised in this way and to be able to share our stories with the world.Dr Farzana Hussain, a GP at Project Surgery, Newham, said: It’s dficult to put into words how privileged I feel to be able to go to work every day and make a dference to people’s lives and to help battle this global pandemic. Now more than ever, it’s important that we see the humanity that makes up our GP practices, community services and hospitals.Every member of staff has their own story, fears and hopes for the future. I think Rankin’s photography brings this outreally well. Sarah Jensen, Chief Information Officer, Barts Health NHS Trust, said: I was very surprised and flattered to be chosen – to be at the forefront of the coronavirus story was not something I was expecting. I feel privileged to be representing my profession, as working for the NHS provides such a rewarding career.

And he amassed a legion of followers after his proud daughter Julianna tweeted his journey and the MTV style video. In the clip, Ed stretched out his arms and jokes “welcome to my crib” as he starts the tour. Ed takes viewers on a tour of his gorgeous café complete with desk, chairs and an extensive drinks menu. A few weeks ago Ed had told his family: “Yeah I think I’m gonna build a coffee shop in the backyard.” They all thought he was joking but after three months of hard work, La Vida was open for business in their back garden. Ed is a contractor and had squirrelled away old materials and items others would deem as rubbish which he repurposed to create his coffee shop.  This included the building structure, doors and the front window.As shown in the video, the mini cafe is kitted out with tables, chairs. Thereaposs even little succulent plants for decoration and tea lights for when it gets dark. It also boasts a fully al coffee maker, a beautully designed menu and plenty of hot beverage options.  The builder turned garden barista gained his inspiration from social media site Pinterest, where he loves looking at little houses and dferent structures. There’s a corner with a chess set, where Ed does his “chilling” as he jokes in the video.  His family were totally in awe of his handiwork, and daughter Julianna took to twitter to ensure he got the recognition he deserved.   She told MirrorOnline: “I’ve grown up watching my dad build amazing things around our house and for other people, he is truly an extraordinary builder.  “He has always had a love for coffee and cozy spots and recently decided to fuel that love into something for his own backyard where the family and our guests can sit back, lounge and bond. “He is a very hardworking man who is all about doing the things he says he’s going to do.

At first, she thought it was a joke, but eventually realised the man she had been reading “every word” about in the local papers was now before her. “He snarled at me several times in a harsh whisper, ‘This isn’t a joke’,” says Margaret, now aged . “Then, in my mind, bam, I knew it was him.” For more than  years, former police officer Joseph DeAngelo terried Calornia. From Sacramento to Los Angeles, the sadistic predator violated peaceful communities with countless rapes and killings. He started in  as a burglar, but escalated to rape and then murder. First known as the East Area Rapist, he ended up being hunted as the “Golden State Killer”. Today he is expected to plead guilty to  charges of murder and rape, to avoid the death penalty. The -year-old was facing a lethal injectionfound guilty, but he is set to admit his crimes at a hearing where his victims will finally come face-to-face with the killer before he is left to die in prison. Margaret, who is set to attend the Sacramento hearing, told how she had gone to sleep around pm on November , , after dinner with her mother, Delores, at their neighbour’s house in the State capital. The realisation about her attacker was confirmed when, bound and gagged, she heard him fetch kitchen crockery. For his attacks all had the same sickening hallmark. DeAngelo would tie up all the others in the house and place a cup on and saucer on their back as he raped his victim. He threatened to kill themhe heard a sound. For years the warnings were just threats until in  he killed his first victims.  Margaret adds: “I heard those plates rattling and him on the stairs. I deducted very simply, very quickly, very logically and very, very calmly what was going to happen.” But instead of being overawed by panic or paralysed with fear, Margaret said, because of what she knew about DeAngelo, her teen defiance took over. “I just calmly accepted it. It was almost like I had somebody here on my shoulder saying, ‘you’re going to be raped. This is what’s going to happen, but you’re going to live. You’re going to survive. You’re going to be okay’. “I knew he wasn’t going to hurt me or kill me as he was threatening the whole time. I was positive from how much I’d read how he operated.  “I was p****d off. I was mad. I was defiant. I was thinking like ‘Why are you here  What are you doing here  How dare you ’ I don’t remember fear. “He wanted fear. I knew he wanted the power through this fear thing, but I wasn’t going to give him that.” Margaret says the rape ordeal lasted  minutes before her attacker fled. For  years detectives were clueless as to who was breaking into dozens of houses.  Hours before his attacks, he would slip into often unlocked properties to learn the layout, cutting phone lines, clearing potential exits and even emptying guns kept by owner’s bedsides. Husbands and boyfriends were of no concern. In the aftermath and into adulthood, as her parents and family struggled to come to terms with her ordeal, the mum, who has a -year-old daughter, says it was her who provided the strength. “I think some women have this experience, and it can ruin the rest of their le, but they identy so much with it that it infiltrates every aspect of their living and you don’t live your le,” she says. “I never let it define me.”  For decades Margaret thought her attacker would never be caught and her obsession with the case waned. She focussed instead on raising her child and the family wine business, and now splits her time between Palm Springs and San Diego. But in  police supplied DeAngelo’s DNA to a genealogy website, which led to a relative being discovered. The ID of the serial rapist and killer was narrowed down to six men.  And in April , the ex-Navy veteran was charged with eight murders, on DNA evidence. DeAngelo cannot be charged with his attack on Margaret, due to a but he is accused of  more kidnapping and abduction bids. Margaret, who has waived her right to anonymity, is adamant she does not want him to be executed.

Video made of a ghost hunt along the old Liverpool Loop Line, known locally as the Ralla, has been creeping out viewers. It follows two men, Chris Cummings and Adam Billing, as they take a walk along the Ralla in the dead of night in May. The video, which has been posted by YouTube channel Ghost Quest TV made by Ben Niall Productions, retraces Chrisapos walk he took as a child  years ago during which he believes he saw the spectre of a young girl.He’s not the only one claims to have seen an apparition, the Liverpool Echo reports. As the pair were filming in the area the morning before their ghost walk, they chanced upon a dog-walker who also claims to have seen the aposgirlapos. The man describes her as having long hair and wearing a white, “puffy” dress which Chris thinks is the same dress he saw aposthe girlapos wearing all those years ago. As well as seeing the apparent ghost, the dog walker claimed he often hears crying noises when heaposs walking down the same footpath. Chris and Adam recreate the childhood walk and things start to take on a serious Blair Witch vibe as they illuminate their steps by torchlight and point their camera into the blackness of the surrounding woodland. As they continue to walk, they think something close among the trees is accompanying them on their journey and they even claim to hear it growl as it moves past. This prompts the pair to bring out a piece of technology called a spirit box - a device they say is tuned to pick out any paranormal activity from background noise.  This is when things start to take a seriously unsettling turn. aposGhostlyapos voices crackle through the spirit box as the pair start to feel uneasy on the dark path. The box continues to pick up sounds - they hear what they think is a person call out to “Adam” and in a small, childlike voice utter the single word “help”.  Chris calls out to who he thinks is aposthe little girlapos who he believes he saw all those years ago and askshershe is trying to communicate with them.  It’s then an older, deeper voice allegedly growls through the spirit box “be gone.” The Ralla is a -mile path for walkers and cyclists along a disused railway line with a rich history. Opened in , the line branched off the Liverpool to Manchester line near Hunts Cross and looped back up around the city before finishing near the docks and connecting to the Southport line.

Police discovered the child during an animal rescue operation on Thursday in Henry County, Tennessee. The childaposs mum Heather Scarbough, , his stepdad, Thomas Jefferson Brown, , and his grandfather, Charles Brown, , were arrested and are facing multiple charges. Henry County Sherf Monte Belew told a press conference on Friday the tot was found among eight snakes,  dogs,  rabbits,  chickens, one gecko, four parakeets, three cats, one pheasant, three sugar gilders, and  mice, rats, and hamsters. He said: In the living room youaposve got a kid caged, youaposve got  snakes and youaposve got the snakes feed butted up against the childaposs cage. Eight snakes in the same room, then mice running everywhere. Mr Belew added that it was evident the child spent most of his le in the cage.  He added: It was heartbreaking to see the conditions this child was living in. There was nothing for that baby in the entire house outside of the cage he was in. All his toys were in there with him. There were no other toys, no crib, no blankets for him. It appeared he spent mostnot all his time in the cage, and the ammonia smell that came up when we lted the cage and the bugs that were under it makes it appear ashe stayed in there a lot.  Officers described the kitchen as unliveable after spotting “thousands of cockroaches and maggots.The entire property was in disarray with rotting food and rubbish scattered around the grounds. Mr Belew added: “There was trash and food on top of the cage . “And you can tell when a child is starving and hungry, and he was starving.  “He needed to be out of there, and the animals did, too.” The child is now in the custody of the Department of Child Services. Police also found  marijuana plants and seventeen guns at the property.

not even those who waited for  minutes without waterproofs.Teachers did their best to shelter some of the smaller ones under umberellas and raincoats.Bedraggled Union flags and Lion Rampants were used by some children to cover their heads.The children got their reward when the Queen passed and gave them a beaming smile on the way to Camperdown Works which was for a time the world’s largest jute works, boasting  power looms,  hand looms and more than , workers.The greatest landmark at Camperdown Works was the -foot high brick chimney Cox’s Stack which was built by James MacLaren in  and modelled on Italian bell towers.The chimney stalk could be seen from almost any point in the city.The Cox family built it to ensure smoke from the furnaces was carried well above the nearby workers’ houses.The Queen and Prince Philip were given a tour of the weaving factory by Sir William Walker, chairman and joint managing director of Jute Industries Limited.From a  in the lower factory the Queen and Prince Philip saw the impressive sight of  looms in one floor all working below them.The royal couple went down to speak to the workers including -year-old Margaret Cooper whose family had strong connections to Camperdown Works.Mrs Cooper had been there for  years and also serving in the same department were her four daughters who were all weavers and the husbands of three of the daughters who were tenters.Four-year-old Ann Bonar, who was the “oldest sitting tenant” of the works’ nursery having been there since she was six months # was chosen to present the Queen with a bouquet of cream roses before her departure.“They all look very sweet,” said Prince Philip to the nursery’s matron.The royal couple moved on to Dundee Royal Infirmary afterwards to open the new radio diagnostic department.The matron Annie O’Dey offered the Queen a pair of embossed silver scissors in a blue padded case before the ceremony.“I hope they will cut,” she said.One snip was enough to sever the broad white silk ribbon across the double doors.Dr Cecil Pickard, consultant radiologist and chief of the department, and Dr George Grant, consultant radiologist, conducted the royal couple on a -minute tour of the new facility.The rain had thinned the crowds by the time the pipes and drums of the  th Battalion of The Black Watch led a guard of  to the City Square.Shortly before .pm the royal couple arrived to cheers from the crowd to have lunch in the City Chambers.The couple left afterwards along Riverside Drive before a final visit to Queen’s College which would go on to become the University of Dundee.mdash UoD Archives  RMJune , Four undergraduates provided a ‘Walter Raleigh’ touch to proceedings.The Queen and Prince Philip were walking to their car when the students laid down their gowns on the wet road between the door of the college and the car.The Queen smiled her thanks.The couple left for Edinburgh following the visit.The city of Dundee has been graced with numerous visits from the Queen.The Courier’s earliest photograph of the Queen in Dundee is of Princess Elizabeth shopping with her grandmother, the Countess of Strathmore, at Webster’s Toy Shop in Whitehall Crescent in the s.Following her visit in  she continued to show an interest in Dundee’s industry when she ed to the city in , taking in Douglasfield Works and The NCR Gourdie Factory.In , she wowed onlookers with a stunning outfit as she left aat the City Chambers.The Queen’s jubilee visit also including planting a tree at Camperdown and meeting a group of Sea Cadets.Prince Philip famously stopped at the Windmill Bar in the Hilltown during the visit and pointed up at the windows before acknowledging the cheers of the regulars.In the evening, after the visit, staff and regulars agreed to send a letter to the duke about the bar.They produced three poems which were copied out on the back of a print of the bar and handed in to the Queen’s bodyguard at Dundee City Chambers.They were amazed some days later to receive a poem in reply, simply titled The Windmill Bar and signed Philip, thanking the regulars for their welcome.In  the Queen received an enthusiastic welcome in Dundee.During her visit she opened WL Gore, went on board the Discovery and greeted the crowds who came out to meet her in City Square.The s saw the Queen make two trips to the City of Discovery, the first in  to visit Expo  and the second to open the University of Abertay in .In , the Queen arrived in the city wearing a striking red coat and hat, which she wore when visiting the University of Dundee Chaplaincy and The Shore, while accompanied by Prince Philip.The couple ed to the city in  and officially opened the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at Dundee University.They also met apprentices working at the Michelin tyre factory in Baldovie before the Queen visited the waterfront and opened Slessor Gardens.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement.

ldquoOne of the main problems in this case is one of supply.ldquoThe substance can feel quite easy to get hold of, but this is absolutely no indicator that it is safe.ldquoIt is extremely dangerous, especially for those with undiagnosed or asymptomatic illnesses.ldquoYoung people who are abusing it are taking huge risks themselves and for their friends as well.ldquoOne of the problems is that there are legitimate uses for the capsules, especially in the catering industry.ldquoThere needs to be a well-rounded approach to tackling this latest trend, involving education, support from the

This is to assess the safety of the vaccine and determine the optimal dosage.A total of  healthy volunteers are expected to be given two doses of the vaccine over the coming weeks.If it is found to be safe, and shows a promising immune response in humans, larger trials will follow later in the year.For more information on the Imperial Covid- vaccine, including how to register as a volunteer, visit the vaccine trial website."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-nitrous-oxide-no-laughing-matter","story":"AS WE approach the traditional school holidays and perhaps some nicer weather, I once again make a plea to all parents and carers of children and young people to make sure you know where they are, who they are with, and ensure they are not engaging in anti-social behaviour.In recent weeks, with lockdown easing, we have seen large gatherings of youths, sometimes more than  at a time, at ious locations around the county.The vast majority of these are all well behaved but a small minority have been engaging in signicant anti-social behaviourand disorder.North Berwick, Tranent and Longniddry have caused us some issues recently, with intoxicated youths verbally abusing passers-by, vandalising items, smashing bottles and leaving a mess behind. This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has.

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-looked-medical-papers---just-say-worried-sick","story":"But the others have been personal moments and attempts to make sense of the seemingly senseless.

Id listen as they steadily grew closer, craning my neck to catch a glimpse of the first float.My gran saved up coppers all year in an old Epsom salt jar, which gave them a dusty sheen that felt gritty and sometimes sticky as I grabbed a handful to throw into the passing collection bucketsAfter the parade, came the park. There would be stalls and races. This was also where you would collect the hallowed gala day box containing a gluttony of treats: a cold pie or sausage roll, a Mars bar, crisps, an iced cake and a plastic carton of juice.Id be allowed to eat one thing because a banquet awaited back at the house, my gran serving up dish after dish, just like she had when in service at a big house in Glasgow many years before.Usually by then the gala day committee would have been round to do the judging and a small piece of card would be proudly taped to the living room window, denoting a placing in the contest for best-dressed house. She even won one year.Rounding off the day was a visit to the shows, where we would eat candy floss, hook a duck, ride the carousel, tear around on the dodgems and take a spin on the waltzers until I was either feeling sick or had run out of pocket money.:Susan Swarbrick: Ill brave the midges this summer ndash our tourism sector needs usThere are no gala days this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, although I hope that, like me, in villages and towns across Scotland, there are others who are fondly reminiscing.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Green hydrogen can also be produced from excess renewable electricity that would otherwise go unused. ldquoIf it secures funding this year, H Fe will be a world first project that will put Scotland at the front of the queue in terms of research and development in this area. As part of the Gas Goes Green programme, it will provide critical research and development on how to deliver hydrogen as zero carbon heating in Scotland.The company is also hoping to produce ldquoblue hydrogen at the St Fergus Gas Terminal to Aberdeen in a new dedicated hydrogen pipeline.Mr McIntosh said: ldquoIt would initially supply the network with a hydrogen blend of up to  per cent, increasing to  per cent following a complete network conversion to hydrogen. ldquoThe carbon dioxide captured when the natural gas is reformed into hydrogen at St Fergus would be stored under the North Sea.He added: ldquoInvestment in projects like H Fe, Aberdeen Vision and the wider hydrogen economy as part of the green recovery could create and support around , engineering, construction and business supportjobs in   ndash and in excess of , by . ldquoScotland is uniquely placed to produce green hydrogen thanks to its world leading offshore wind capacity and blue hydrogen thanks to existing North Sea infrastructure.But environmental campaigners have warned that the report ldquofails to set out any new thinking or concrete measures that would deliver the transformation change needed to reduce emissions.:Legal challenge could scupper poundmillion flagship superfast broadband planCaroline Rance, climate and energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ldquoCarbon capture and storageis nothing but a dangerous distraction from the urgent task of reducing emissions and ending the use of fossil fuels. ldquoWorldwide, CCS has received billions of dollars in investment over the past decade, but it still isnrsquot working at the scale promised and it likely never will. ldquoHydrogen is being touted as the solution to all our problems at the minute, but we really donrsquot need it for heat and transport.

They were more honest times. There used to be a petrol can inside which you could use to fill your car with petrol to get you to the petrol station, and then bring back filled up again.ldquoThe AA man used to salute as you went by, their shoes were always polished and their unorms were very smart.As well as providing a leline for passing motorists, the boxes had a range of uses for locals, he adds.ldquoWomen would used them to get changed in. One chap who liked a flutter was a member of the AA but he didnrsquot have a phone at home. He used to go to the AA box and get the AA man to put on his bet for him.ldquoI think some things that went on in them that are best left unsaid.The motor vehicle was still in its infancy in  when the Automobile Association, formed just seven years earlier, decided to follow the lead of the RAC and provide sentry posts dotted around the country for its patrolmen.While the RACrsquos blue boxes tended to fade into the landscape, the AArsquos black and brilliant yellow boxes would become familiar features of road for generations of motorists.Originally intended as shelters for smartly dressed sentries or patrolmen on bicycles or motorbikes, who were more likely to help motorists with directions or warn of police speed traps than tow stricken vehicles to the nearest garage, boxes soon sprang up across the country.So-called lsquosuperrsquo boxes featured signposts on the roof which were illuminated at night and equipped with fire extinguishers, spare parts and tools to help get cars moving.Some became focal points of rural villages, with features such as mock wells, dovecots and flower gardens arranged around the boxes.But by the early s, the traditional wooden boxes began to disappear in favour of modern, pedestal telephones. Easier to maintain, they offered motorists stuck at the side of a road no protection from the elements.Writer Bernard Bale, who has researched the boxes, said: ldquoThe AA boxes on a main road in the middle of nowhere were a welcoming sight, like the lights of a homely pub on a cold, winters evening.ldquoHaving an AA badge on the grill of your car was like being awarded the OBE. The salute from a passing AA man impressed the kids, the mother-in-law and other passengers and the service on offer from both the AA and RAC was ndash and still is ndash the equivalent in relief of a truck giving you a lt when you are walking across the Sahara desert and still only halfway.ldquoThe boxes outlived their usefulness, time and further progress having made them redundant. The mobile phone rules everything these days and the legendary AA box like so many war survivors are few in number.Scotlandrsquos seven remaining AA boxes are in remote and often picturesque spots. The most northerly one, number , sits on the A a few miles south east of Ardgay, a stonersquos throw from the Dornoch Firth.While travellers on the A at its junction with the A at Dava close to Loch Allan and Grantown-on-Spey, pass box , complete with handy clock on the door.Box , dating from the s and with a distinctive white pitched roof, stands on the A close to Abriachan and by the banks of Loch Ness.The carefully restored box at Cambus OrsquoMay, number , sits close to the royal warrant village of Ballater, while box  is off the beaten track on the B, on a twisting road south of Banchory.Box  sits on the north side of the A Aberdeen to Inverness road, peeking out from lush woodland at Threapland, while Scotlandrsquos most southerly AA box, number , occupies a lonely spot on the A at Cappercleuch, Selkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"how-glasgow-communities-torn-apart-name-progress","story":"Inside were wide corridors, shiny floors and ceilings adorned with ornate cornicing, with elegant rooms that played host to countless weddings, celebrations, and well-heeled guests.Yet Glasgowrsquos Grand Hotel was destined to become just one victim of a massive construction project that would see communities torn up and buildings which today would be cherished, sacriced at the altar of the motor vehicle.Construction work on the Kingston Bridge, the M and the cityrsquos Inner Ring Road meant time had run out for anything that stood in its path. And demolition teams would mount an assault on red sandstone, bricks, and mortar, along with the tight-knit communities that held families close, their schools, much-loved shops, busy workplaces, and precious parts of Glasgowrsquos heritage.Although not directly a victim of the construction of the Kingston Bridge itself, the Grand Hotel, and a host of buildings in Charing Cross were part of the same audacious plan to revolutionise transport through the city. Standing in the path of progress ndash but not for long - stood swathes of Anderston, Townhead, Cowcaddens and Kinning Park.Some, of course, were rotten with poverty, overcrowded and in dire need of action. Demolition was probably regarded as a blessing.But others, such as the elegant tenements that stood on the southside at Kingston ndash which gave its name to the bridge that would transform travel and the city ndash or at Charing Cross, where link roads would plough through the site of the Grand Hotel, the loss would be mourned for decades to come.By the time the Kingston Bridge was opened by The Queen on  June,  ndash almost exactly  years ago - communities which stood in the way of its ramps, access roads and the cityrsquos new transport map dominated by its inner ring road, were long gone.ldquoGlasgow was almost a testing ground for inner city motorways, says Norry Wilson, the writer and historian whose Lost Glasgow Facebook site and accompanying website documents the changing face of the city. ldquoIt was the scale and sheer destructive nature of it all. Itrsquos interesting that after the Glasgow experience no other inner-city motorway was built like that.Even those whose homes and businesses escaped the hammer, knew change was happening. ldquoEvery day your nostrils would be full of black snotters, the whole city was engulfed in soot because so much was being demolished, he adds.ldquoChildren would go to nursery or school and come home with clothes black because there was so much soot in the air.A new bridge across the Clyde had been proposed as far back as  when the controversial Bruce Report looked to regenerate the post-war city.Ruthless in its outlook, it suggested clearing slums along with a major new roads network that placed some of Glasgowrsquos architectural gems including the Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow City Chambers, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and Central Station in its crosshairs.ldquoThe Bruce Report is remembered for advocating wholesale demolition of the city centre and rebuilding it in some kind of s eastern bloc style, says Stuart Baird, chairperson of Glasgow Motorway Archive.ldquoThere was a lot of austerity after the war, and they couldnrsquot agree on where the development should happen.It took over a decade before an agreement was reached that  inner-city areas should be earmarked for comprehensive redevelopment, paving the way for a pared back version of the Bruce Reportrsquos road plans.While some historic gems were saved, the delivery of Glasgow Inner Ring Road, the M and the Kingston Bridge would see others met their end. Swathes of Townhead were flattened, including Parliamentary Road, which ran from Sauchiehall Street to the East End.And tenements in Cowcaddens, an area blighted by high child mortality rates, slums and low le expectancy, were razed to make way for new concrete corridors. As the new road network crept towards the Clyde, it gobbled up communities which formed when the land was still being farmed and homes were clustered in simple villages.Hardest hit was Anderston.By the late th century it had grown to become a bustling community of weavers, with bleaching, printing and dyeing industries alongside potteries, breweries and once dominated by the  feet high cone of the Verreville Glassworks.Many within its community of around , residents were told to clear out to make way for the Inner Ring Road and bridge plan.Not even Anderston Relief Church in Heddle Place, erected in , nor the arearsquos three cemeteries ndash the one linked to the church, another a Catholic cemetery at St Markrsquos and one more at North Street ndash would dodge the demolition teams.ldquoThere are still horrible folk tales of how old graveyards dating back to the s were removed, with heaps of bones taken away and dumped in unmarked graves in other cemeteries, recalls Norry.Indeed, some ghostly tales still suggest that the bones of the long-departed are remain trapped beneath the bridgersquos foundations, doomed to lie forever beneath the rumble of overhead traffic.There was similar devastation on the southside.ldquoOpposite Kingston Halls on Paisley Road West were once beautul gardens and tenements leading up to Scotland Street School, recalls Norry.ldquoIt was a very populated area, with good working-class communities. These were decent tenements, not slums, but they were swept away along with pubs, schools, and shops. The people were almost cast to the wind, shunted out to places like Easterhouse, East Kilbride and Castlemilk.As work began on the Kingston Bridge, rubble from properties which once stood by the edges of the Clyde poured into its foundations. While at relatively well-to-do Charing Cross, a fashionable and busting junction drew people to its markets, shops and cafes, stylish buildings would also be washed way by a tsunami of demolition and construction.They included properties on North Street and the Grand Hotel, described by Stuart as ldquoprobably the biggest casualty of the Inner Ring Road. Designed by architect James Thomson, it opened in , it had  rooms, a ballroom, a cocktail bar and ninerooms. In its prime, it entertained wedding receptions and lavish assemblies of debutantes and bachelors, and, of course, guests from around the world.Among its most famous was Colonel William Cody ndash Buffalo Bill ndash who strode through its wood and brass revolving doors in December  as guest of honour of the cityrsquos  Club.Lunch consumed, the party retreated to hotelrsquos grand ballroom where Native Americans performed and a cowboy band played. Few would deny that by the s it was a little dated, but nothing a little attention couldnrsquot solve.The irony, adds Norry, is that communities and heritage were sacriced for roads and a bridge in a city where cars were not king for most.ldquoIt was never designed to help the people of Glasgow it was to get people from one side to the other without going through Glasgow.ldquoGlasgow compared with a lot of other British cities has a very low per capita car ownership figure.ldquoWhen you talk to older people about what was lost, they are full of stories and talk of it as a criminal act of destruction, he adds.ldquoYounger people just ask why we ever allowed it to happen."},{"url":null,"title":"loggerheads-lennoxtown-residents-odds-housing-plans","story":"This handsome village, lying  miles to Glasgowrsquos north-east, is surrounded by some of the most charismatic countryside to be found in west central Scotland.Just behind it lie the Campsie Hills and Campsie Glen and on the other side, the bleak beauty of the ancient Lennox Forest. The families who have lived here for generations are fiercely proud of its working-class identity.:Legal challenge could scupper poundmillion flagship superfast broadband planLennoxtown has encountered many of the social iniquities that have harrowed similar small communities across west central Scotland. In recent times itrsquos witnessed the dismantling of a once-thriving industrial base that provided steady, skilled and well-paid employment. Lennox Castle Hospital, the local nail-works and the pulp factory in neighbouring Milton of Campsie have all disappeared and with them the jobs and local businesses they sustained.Its busy main street was once a thrumming commercial hub of local food-shops. One by one they all vanished. Lennoxtown is also in dire need of good affordable housing to relieve a chronic shortage apparent across the whole of East Dunbartonshire. But a proposed small housing development planned for a small, two-hectare site on the eastern approach to the village encapsulates why Scotland still has a persistent shortage of social housing, despite the best efforts of the Scottish Government.The site is home to an unremarkable cluster of largely non-native trees which have grown to an inordinate height. Thus, when you turn into Lennoxtown from its main approach road you are greeted by a small clump of overgrown woodland which blocks out the hills and one of the most magnicent vistas in west central Scotland.Yet, the proposed development has met fierce resistance from residents in adjacent streets. These are part of a larger private housing estate comprising some of the most expensive houses in the area. Ironically, these were built on a large area of woodland which itself had been a much-loved recreational space for local families.Johnny Leslie, a pensions adviser whose family is embedded in this community is angry at the prospect of a much-needed social housing development being obstructed by what he regards as ldquopure nimbyism.ldquoWersquove witnessed the steady disappearance of all our community shops: the butcherrsquos, the bank, the baker the fishmongers. When someone offers to build good, solid, affordable housing, bringing with it the chance to stimulate the community you grab it. Yet I went to a public meeting and it was clear that some people just didnrsquot like the idea of it being built near them.ldquoThis development will also create a signicant number of well-paid skilled jobs for a couple of years. An opportunity such as this would be a real leline to this community.Opponents of the development have cited environmental and bio-ersity concerns. Yoursquore left with the impression that this is some kind of Scottish Serengeti and that Sir David Attenborough might soon be pitching up in the neighbourhood.This, by one resident, reflected many of the concerns: ldquoI believe that mentioned damage to existing woodland, construction work and long-term use of this area will generate signicant increase in localised road traffic and increase in CO emissions.Another said: ldquoThe drawings show that the new development is standing on relatively flat surface. I am assuming that to achieve this, there will be a need to remove signicant amount of the treesand signicant amount of soil. I am assuming that the removal of the trees and soil could consequently affect the hillside stability and its current ability to retain water.An Ecological Impact report by the respected EnviroCentre concluded: ldquoNo statutory designated sites or ancient woodland are present within the site. It added that ldquoone tree located in the south of the site is considered to offer low Potential Roost Features for bats and that ldquoa potential squirrel drey, considered to be that of a grey squirrel, was identied in the south of the site. There was one wood pigeonrsquos nest and that ldquono field evidence of badger, red squirrel, West European hedgehog or brown hare was identied. Yoursquod find more wild animals in a window-box, in a manner of speaking.The council planners have thus far chosen to pursue a blocking strategy, citing concerns about the validity of the consultation and the familiar bio-ersity concerns. Depute Chief Executive, Place, Neighbourhood  Corporate Assets, Thomas Glen, said: ldquoThe planning service has a duty to consider the pre-application consultation carried out by applicants on receiving a major planning application. The national guidance is clear that concerns about pre-application consultation should be raised as early as possible by planning authorities. In this case the planning service raised concerns at a suitably early stage to allow the applicant to recty the situation.The developers though, point to advice from the Council before the application which states: ldquoThe woodland also has limited bioersity value due to the dominance of non-native coners.The Pre-application Consultation Report runs to  pages and was much broader in scope and scale than a four-question Facebook survey organised by the local community council which showed that an incredible % of social media respondents opposed the development. Yet, the developersrsquo survey indicated a clear majority in favour of affordable housing and the increased recreational space envisaged by the development.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Sturgeons economic recovery wonrsquot be about de-growth but jobs, jobs jobsA spokesperson for the developer rejected all objections by opponents: ldquoThe proposed development at has progressed on the basis of advice received from the Planning Department during pre-application discussions. East Dunbartonshire Councilrsquos Planning Department clearly set out the measures expected from the development to ensure a policy compliant application was submitted. It is our opinion that we have exceeded the requirements asked of us, in writing, by East Dunbartonshire Council.Local SNP councillor, Paul Ferretti is also opposed to the development following representations by concerned residents. He said: ldquoHaving attended every Community Council meeting, where this issue was on the agenda, and having received a large volume of correspondence on the issue, I would disagree with the premise that the reason why nearby residents are up in arms is due to the potential of social housing being on the site. Their concerns have centred on bioersity, the height of the flats, loss of woodland, access roads etc.The Herald though, has an audio-recording of a conversation between the architects and a senior council planner in which the official is clearly heard to suggest thatthe affordable housing element were to be removed it might have a chance of proceeding. A nearby resident vocerously opposed to the development suggested to the architects that perhaps ldquosome bungalows would be acceptable, an idea which would feature in a subsequent email exchange. In  Shelter Scotland reported that there had been , homeless applications during the previous  months and that , households were assessed as homeless by their local authority. This equates to a household losing their home every . minutes. If some local residents and the local planners prevail no relief will be found in Lennoxtown any time soon."},{"url":null,"title":"blueprint-scotlands-post-covid-recovery-read-full-132-page-special-edition-heralds-business-hq-magazine","story":"For many businesses, it continues to be a battle for survival, especially for those running smaller companies who slipped through the cracks in government support schemes.For employers and staff alike, UK Government plans to phase out the furlough programme have heaped uncertainty on uncertainty, especially in sectors at the back of the queue to reopen.So where are we headed  We have not been here before, with so much dislocation, and so much disruption around the globe triggered by the human tragedy that is the coronavirus pandemic.In this special edition of Business HQ we focus within our borders, consulting with business leaders and experts on what Scotlandrsquos economy needs to do to survive and thrive.It will be a long haul and no one has a map, but we have to start somewhere.Ian McConnellBusiness Editor, The HeraldClick here to read the full special edition"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-letters-readers-saying-week","story":"For my mind, two things were more material in the decision to accelerate theto school.

Their views on the latter cannot be seriously contested.What is a statue  It is surely, amongst other things, an attempt to transcend time and space. These petried representatives of horror that fill our public spaces are not merely signicant in their materiality, they are also important as figurative projections of power, rank and prestige propelled from the past into the present. The intention behind them was that they were to be honoured and acknowledged as emblems of a dominant class who took their barbarous rule as a natural right. More importantly, they help underpin that same domination today.Any statue is both a presence and an absence. All statues fill a space and, simultaneously, obscure and conceal. I would argue that the removal of these monstrosities would help reveal the more authentic history desired by Prof Wardle and Sir Tom.Finally,we are to fully examine Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, we should endeavour to avoid clumsy conflations. The Scottish millworker and the Scottish crewman did not \"benefit\" from slavery. They were part of a dynamic of capitalist accumulation in which they had little say and little power. They led miserable lives characterised by long hours, disease and premature death. If Sir Tom wishes to insist they did benefit then he should at least employ some form of calibration and dferentiation. The slave owner and the merchant stole the lives of the slave and the wage slave.Alex Porter, Stirling.BEING a naturalised Scot of mixed West Indian British heritage, I have a concern that the more admirable aspects of the Black Lives Matter campaign are being ruined by a very sinister development.\"Taking the Knee\", originally a brave and meaningful gesture by black American sportsmen and equality campaigners, later adopted by supporters of all races, has been devalued by the way the media are using it.Singling out any public figure who is not an enthusiastic \"knee taker\" for opprobrium, effectively makes the act compulsory for anyone who does not want to risk their reputation, their job, or harassment by a large and angry segment of society.Many non-believers living in extremely strict religious communities will attend or comply with the requirements of that religion in order to fit in and avoid persecution ndash even though they live otherwise blameless and good lives. Compulsory gestures of solidarity or belief have no real value to any cause as they make it impossible to judge the true extent of \"belief\". Obligatory worship or participation in religious ritual by non-believers cannot be of any value to the Deity concerned.Neither politicians nor anyone  should be questioned or criticised about their non-participation in someone rsquos gestures or rituals.

Mr Johnsonrsquos determination to prove to a Sunday paper that he was fit for purpose had led to the bizarre sight of the Prime Minister hitting the deck and giving the reporter hellip well, it was not specied how many push-ups he had done.First sign of a tone being set was BBC Breakfast host Chris Mason telling viewers that Marr was ldquolimbering up for his show.Marr, turning to the photo on the front of the Mail on Sunday, said: ldquoThis is the Prime Minister, adding ldquowe are told, asit was possible a body double was used.Then there was the PMrsquos description of himself as ldquofit as a butcherrsquos dog.

With the rapid easing of the lockdown in England, and scenes of disturbances at illegal gatherings, it was her job to figuratively read the riot act. ldquoWe can enjoy ourselves in a very responsible way, said Ms Patel.The usual pre-BBC pop-in to Ridge on Sunday yielded a story when Ms Patel was asked about those Labour MPs who had accused her of using her own experiences of racism to ldquogaslight the ldquovery real racism faced by black people in the UK.Ridge askedsome people had a particular problem with Ms Patel as ldquoa BAME woman who was a Conservative.Ms Patel said: ldquoThey clearly take the position that I donrsquot conform to their preconceived idea or stereotypical view of what an ethnic minority woman should stand for and represent. In my view, that in itself is racist.Marr, in true Columbo-style, had one last question for the Minister. Was she going abroad on holiday in the summer  ldquoIrsquoll be working hard throughout the summer, said Ms Patel.: Scientist warns UK on kne edgeEarlier, Joanna Lumley appeared on Marr to plug a special performance of Waiting for Godot in aid of entertainment charities.ldquoAndrew, yoursquore going to be coming to sit on my lap, said the former star of Ab Fab and The New Avengers.ldquoWe werenrsquot to tell people that, Joanna, said Marr.She was treated to the holiday question too. If ever Marr fancies yet another job he would fit right in as a hairdresser. FYI, Ms Lumley is going to France with her husband.And what of the push-up king  Where might the PM be going on holiday  There was a perhaps a clue when he told the Mail on Sunday that some of the best holidays he had had were in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Devon, adding ldquoWhy go anywhere  That festive break in a luxury villa in the Caribbean, his last holiday, had clearly not lived up to expectations.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

[Economy Secretary] Fiona Hyslop has indicated she will respond to the Higgins Report towards the end of July.\"So First Minister and Fiona let the customer, let business come together and write your answer guided by a lead civil servant who understands business and your budgets but with no sacred cows.\"Do not have the civil service or your agencies write an implementation plan for a customer they donrsquot really understand let us in business take this on, trust business to do it and work with you on this.\"I know we can engage the best brains from around the world on this and the best in Scotland.\"Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Donald Cameron said: ldquoDuring the coronavirus pandemic wersquove seen just how inventive and enterprising Scotlandrsquos business community can be. But that ingenuity is met by incompetence and disinterest by the SNP.\"Over more than a decade in government, the nationalists have proved they donrsquot understand business, or respect the need for the economy to thrive.\"For once, the SNP should listen to iniduals like Sir Tom Hunter and act on his advice.A Scottish Government spokesman said it is supporting tens of thousands of businesses with pound.bn of response support and with a Return to Work package of poundm.He added: ldquoAs we restart the economy and work through recovery needs as the report from the Advisory Group on Economic Recovery, led by Benny Higgins, sets out, we will need all of Scotland to step up to the mark and that will require a new partnership between business and government, as well as civic Scotland.ldquoWe will set out our response by the end of the July but action has to start before then and will most definitely need partnership between business and Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government recognises the extensive business contributions to the advisory grouprsquos report, contributions from the Hunter Foundation and the need for all of Scotland to pull together to steer us to recovery.ldquoThe Scottish Government will respond to the independent advisory group by the end of July but will be taking action to start delivering on recommendations now in advance of that ndash action which will certainly involve Scotlandrsquos business talent."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Marianne Taylor  We   re all public health guinea pigs now    but that   s just the way it has to be","story":"Irsquove also started planning a wee holiday up north and have booked a hairdressersrsquo appointment.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households. Further details to follow in coming days.July  — Outdoor sports to resume and shopping centres to reopen.July  —  Meeting  indoors with up to two other households to be allowed, with physical distancing and attention to hygiene indoor learning and childcare service to resumeholiday accommodation, museums, galleries, monuments, cinemas and libraries to reopen . This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis. But before you head for a drink, you#ll be able to get that much-needed chop at the hairdressers or barbers.Ms Sturgeon explained that other Phase Three plans, such as communal gatherings including weddings and funerals, will require further consideration. Changes to guidance around this is unlikely to take effect before July .The First Minister also confirmed Scotland#s aim to move away from blanket guidance for all shielding people, with hopes instead of more tailored advice.She said: #Our challenge, which is not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping this virus firmly under control.#If, at any stage, there appears to be a resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted — and we may need to go backwards.#To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include play areas within school grounds and the skate park in Kirkwall.From that date, the play area at the Pickaquoy Centre will be open, but the rest of the complex and surrounding grounds will remain closed.Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC’s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “I am very pleased that the gradual easing of lockdown allows us to reopen play areas throughout Orkney.“I am sure this will be welcomed by many children, young people and their families, especially as the summer holidays are fast approaching.“In line with Government requirements, we strongly advise that everyone follows hand hygiene and physical distancing guidance when visiting play areas.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PARKING-FAIRY-POOLS-4.jpg","title":"letters mothball tourism until vaccine praise for responsible","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOn a purely local, Highland level, with Test, Track and Trace in place, there is much to commend that view.There is also a view widely supported that the Tourist Industry should be restarted.I use the phrase Test, Track and Trace because it closely illustrates what must be done.I asked VisitScotland how many tourists they expected this summer in the Highlands. They had absolutely no idea.What we can surmise is that to anyone where in the UK this looks like a great, safe, destination.It doesn’t really matter because one infected person, , could result in  being infected  days later, and, unchecked, every three days after that the number of infections doubles.If you were on a family holiday and you had very mild symptoms, would you report them, or think you had a summer cold Let us be absolutely clear that the only reason this “R” number is where it is, is because we have all been kept in our homes to stop the virus spreading.The virus is still out there.The stated defence, in fact the only defence, , against that happening is Test, Track and Trace.How do you Test, Track and Trace an itinerant population of “let’s say”  to  tourists who move their location pretty much every day I think inviting an unrestricted number of visitors to the fragile Highland communities is a huge risk.Don’t think I don’t understand the economic consequences. My we and I run a very well-regarded BB taking people from all over the world.This year we will have none.Most BBs are not going to go bust, the owners are living in their own homes.Not so with hotels. So, we need a dferent answer anyway, because the chances are the hotels are not going to make up the number of bed-nights they need to survive in the next three or four months.Both the businesses and their staff need protection.Liquidators and Receivers should be instructed, by Government, to close the business downto stop the ebb of money, and either protect them from creditors, or much better pay the creditors with Government sponsored bank loans, keeping a close record of that expenditure. Perhaps they could also pay the staff They should mothball the business waiting for the day a vaccine or a cure is found, and it can re-open safely, and be handed back to the previous owners. The owners would then be given favourable, very long-term loans to pay back the costs met by the liquidators and receivers.There will be a cost, but a cost the owners can later meet, over many years, at low or virtually zero interest rates. The Government should not foot that bill, but it could facilitate it.I do not for one micro second forget the massive and fantastic contributions to health and care workers, and those on the front line who delivered to our doors at this time.However, my respect and admiration goes to the owners and staff of tourist and hospitality businesses.The financial and mental strains needing to remain optimistic, to remain as responsible employers and to face the financial crisis that this pandemic has brought, needs some recognition.I am sure the cost to trade and business may never truly be known, but must exceed millions of pounds.To those who kept us all safe, by cancelling visitors and closing shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions at this testing time, simple words of thanks are not in any compensation for the vast loss in revenue from the sector.But I would just like to thank all those ethical and responsible businesses that did the right thing, and helping to decrease the possibility of the spread of this virus.The sacrices of owners and staff will not be forgotten, and I would urge all local people to rally round and support these businesses when it is safe to do so.Tourism and hospitality is the mainstay and leblood of our local economy, and with everyone#s help, in time it will recover.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bbc-salisbury.jpg","title":"timely salisbury series showed ordinary people doing the best in an unprecedented","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMy kids seemed to have survived this oversight in their upbringing although in high school it apparently caused some surprise among their pals.I should add it is not all books by candlelight. We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions. While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Public services will be held in many local churches today for the first time in months. There will be many restrictions in place to protect worshippers from possible coronavirus infection. Catholic Bishop of Derry, Doanl McKeown, welcomed the resumption of services but urged people to take care. “I hope that we have learned lessons about le since we were locked down in March,” he said. “This is a time to cherish those lessons and not to allow the insights to be lost in a tsunami of going back to the future. googletag.cmd.push “We have seen what has happened in those places where there has been a stampede to forget we escaped from worse consequences through self-discipline. “It will take many people time to overcome the fear of mixing again. “We want our churches to be places where people can share the infectious good news of the Gospel – but avoid being Corona-infected through selfishness and carelessness. “We have to begin cautiously. “In all areas of human le, short term gain can lead to long-term pain.” The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Andrew Forster, has also appealed to parishioners to be patient and understanding as their churches get ready for the resumption of public worship. googletag.cmd.push “Although in Ireland, at the moment, the virus seems very much under control – which we’re so thankful for – we know the virus is still there,” Bishop Andrew said. “We’ve been given the freedom to meet again [from Monday], but we know that with freedom comes responsibility. “At the moment, going back to church places a lot of responsibility on you and on me, on select vestries and on clergy, and on all those who will attend churches because we’ve got to follow all the public health guidelines and we’ve got to follow the guidelines that the Church of Ireland has put together for that. “I really welcome the opportunity to be back at church but I want you to know that there’s no set date by which this may happen, because select vestries – and clergy in particular – have to make sure that in their parishes it’s right and it’s appropriate and it’s safe to open, and that’ll take time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Public services will be held in many local churches today for the first time in months. There will be many restrictions in place to protect worshippers from possible coronavirus infection. Catholic Bishop of Derry, Doanl McKeown, welcomed the resumption of services but urged people to take care. “I hope that we have learned lessons about le since we were locked down in March,” he said. “This is a time to cherish those lessons and not to allow the insights to be lost in a tsunami of going back to the future. googletag.cmd.push “We have seen what has happened in those places where there has been a stampede to forget we escaped from worse consequences through self-discipline. “It will take many people time to overcome the fear of mixing again. “We want our churches to be places where people can share the infectious good news of the Gospel – but avoid being Corona-infected through selfishness and carelessness. “We have to begin cautiously. “In all areas of human le, short term gain can lead to long-term pain.” The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Andrew Forster, has also appealed to parishioners to be patient and understanding as their churches get ready for the resumption of public worship. googletag.cmd.push “Although in Ireland, at the moment, the virus seems very much under control – which we’re so thankful for – we know the virus is still there,” Bishop Andrew said. “We’ve been given the freedom to meet again [from Monday], but we know that with freedom comes responsibility. “At the moment, going back to church places a lot of responsibility on you and on me, on select vestries and on clergy, and on all those who will attend churches because we’ve got to follow all the public health guidelines and we’ve got to follow the guidelines that the Church of Ireland has put together for that. “I really welcome the opportunity to be back at church but I want you to know that there’s no set date by which this may happen, because select vestries – and clergy in particular – have to make sure that in their parishes it’s right and it’s appropriate and it’s safe to open, and that’ll take time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

While I missed my family and friends and others who have played a signicant part in my le, I am glad that they could watch from afar via the live-stream.The service began with a welcome and call to worship by the Moderator of Down Presbytery, Rev Dario Leal, minister of First Ballynahinch Presbyterian.During the service, which included three pre-recorded items of worship by members Second Saintfield, Brian McKee a representative elder to the Presbytery from First Ballynahinch, read from  Timothy :-.The sermon, based on the reading from First Timothy, was delivered by the Rev David Hyndman, minister of Magherahamlet and Spa Presbyterian Churches, who convened the Second Saintfield vacancy.Those present for the service and others watching online from over  separate locations also heard short pre-recorded speeches after the service had concluded.One was a message of welcome from Stanley McFarland, Clerk of Session of Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church.The Presbytery Moderator described the installation and ordination service as ldquodferent, but a special evening.He added: ldquoJohn received and accepted a call from Second Saintfield on the Monday before lockdown. While it was frustrating for all concerned that his ordination and installation could not take place in Saintfield due to the restrictions in place, we were delighted and relieved when the offer came from the PCIrsquos General Secretary inviting us to use Assembly Buildings.ldquoIt now means that John can commence his ministry for which he trained and has been called to.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\"
