Meghan is expected to begin the visit by adding her voice to the thousands who have spoken out about the rising violence against women in South Africa.Meghan, who is a champion of gender equality, is likely to raise the issue when her tour of South Africa with husband Harry and their son Archie starts on Monday.The couple\u0027s first event will be a visit to a Township in Cape Town, where they will tour a workshop that provides a range of services to young people, including self-defence classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community.Campaigners took to the streets of Cape Town earlier this month to protest at what they claimed was their government\u0027s failure to deal with the problem, following a series of attacks that have shocked the African nation.It is understood Meghan and Harry watched the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u0027s address to his country following days of protests, when he acknowledged the African nation was facing a national crisis of violence against women.The former actress is an active humanitarian campaigner – particularly on the topic of gender equality – who has spoken about women\u0027s empowerment.Meghan\u0027s activism famously started at a young age. At 11 she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to then first lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen.The Sussexes\u0027 first tour as a family comes after the duke and duchess flew to Rome to watch Meghan\u0027s close friend, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, marry oil tycoon Michael Hess on Friday.Among the guests at the lavish celebration were Harry\u0027s cousins Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, US president Donald Trump\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, and actor James Corden.

The news comes amid reports that one of Mr Corbyn\u0027s closest aides has resigned (Andrew Fisher is pictured), issuing a warning that the Labour leader will not win the next general electionA Labour source said: \u0027We don\u0027t comment on staffing matters.\u0027The plot to scrap Mr Watson\u0027s position was spearheaded by Jon Lansman, the boss of the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group.Mr Watson, who was met by cheering supporters as he arrived at Brighton station for the conference on Saturday afternoon, was scathing about Mr Lansman.He said: \u0027I think it says there are some people who don\u0027t think clear-headedly, who risk us having a transformative government by playing sectarian games.\u0027I put Jon Lansman in that category and I think it\u0027s very sad because I think he has undermined himself and the members of his organisation, many of whom have been in touch with me today and said they were not consulted when he did that and they were very disappointed with him personally.\u0027But that\u0027s politics, I\u0027ve been around a long time and I want us to reunite now.\u0027         Tom Watson (pictured in Brighton today ahead of the Labour Party Conference) has described the attempt to remove him as deputy leader of the Labour party as a \u0027drive-by shooting\u0027       Mr Watson was the target of an ambush at the Labour National Executive Committee (NEC) on Friday night, at which he was not present due to family commitments.Although a surprise effort to abolish the post of deputy was ruled out of order by chair Wendy Nichols, those present voted by 17-10 in a bid to debate it anyway - just short of the two-thirds majority required under party rules.But the motion was due to be debated on Saturday morning\u0027s meeting of the NEC, just hours before the official start of a party conference supposed to be focused on preparing for a looming election.After Mr Corbyn intervened with his call for a review of the deputy leadership position, the bid to abolish it was not put to a vote.  Also on Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government would aim to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050.

But his real work was for the Soviets, and it was not just documents that George Blake was turning over to the KGB.It was names as well – the identities of agents working for SIS. Most of them were East Germans, though they included Soviets and other nationalities. As with the documents, Blake could not put a number on how many agents he betrayed.\u0027I can\u0027t say, but it must have been maybe 500, 600,\u0027 he later said.By 1960, Blake had had enough. Hoping to leave espionage behind, he gained a posting to Lebanon to learn Arabic – but it was too late. After years of treachery, he had himself been exposed by a Polish defector. Lured back to London in 1961, Blake was arrested and, during his interrogation, confessed.His wife, Gillian, was horrified, she said, at \u0027the unbelievable news that this man, to whom I have been so happily married for nearly seven years, was in prison awaiting trial as a Russian spy.\u0027Pleading guilty to five charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act at the Old Bailey, Blake had expected to receive a maximum sentence of 14 years, but Lord Parker, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, had an unpleasant surprise in store.\u0027Your conduct in many other countries would undoubtedly carry the death penalty,\u0027 he said.\u0027In our law, however, I have no option but to sentence you to imprisonment, and for your traitorous conduct extending over so many years there must be a very heavy sentence.\u0027 Parker imposed a sentence of 14 years for each count, three of them to run consecutively and two of them concurrently, 42 years in all. There were audible gasps in the courtroom.Escape came naturally to Blake. During his 1,000-mile journey across Europe in the war, he had jumped off a moving train in Belgium to evade German soldiers and trekked across the snowy Pyrenees on a mule trail.By 1965, he had finally realised that the KGB were not going to get him out of the dingy Victorian confines of Wormwood Scrubs. If he was going to be freed, he needed people who were still on the inside but due to be released soon, who could co-ordinate a plan. He settled on Sean Aloyisious Bourke, an Irishman with an anti-authoritarian bent who was serving an eight-year sentence for attempting to kill a police officer. He also enlisted the help of Pat Pottle and Michael Randle, two idealistic anti-nuclear campaigners he\u0027d met in the prison\u0027s music appreciation class.Bourke planned to make a rope ladder to scale the 20-foot wall, but wooden rungs would make it heavy and noisy, so Randle\u0027s wife Anne proposed making the rungs with knitting needles.A size 13 needle, made of steel and coated in plastic, would be strong enough to hold a man yet add little weight, she suggested.Bourke bought nylon clothes line at Woolworths, and then went to a nearby shop to buy the needles. \u0027I\u0027ll have 30,\u0027 he told the sales clerk.Incredulous, she raised her eyebrows and said: \u0027Your wife must be doing a lot of knitting.\u0027 Bourke made last-minute preparations, buying a second-hand television he could use to monitor the news and some clothes that Blake could wear.The escape was set for the evening of Saturday, October 22, when the other inmates would be watching a film and well away from D Hall, the block housing Blake.A few days in advance, another prisoner – an expert at breaking and entering – had loosened two panes of glass from the tall Gothic-style window that took up much of the exterior wall and Blake now had possession of a walkie-talkie, smuggled in for him so that he could talk to the newly free Bourke.As darkness fell, Blake slipped out through the window, made his way to the edge of the roof and dropped to the ground, telling Bourke over the radio that he was ready for the ladder.But Bourke sounded agitated.\u0027Hang on just a sec,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I am up against an unexpected snag.\u0027 A security guard in a van was driving down the road and evidently thought there was something suspicious about a car parked so near the prison wall – Bourke\u0027s.He stopped his van and stepped out, holding a large Alsatian guard dog on a leash. He stared in at Bourke, making no attempt to hide his suspicions.Spooked, Bourke drove off. But after driving a circuit, he returned to find the van gone and finally radioed Blake.Bourke could hear great anxiety in Blake\u0027s voice. \u0027Well, I\u0027m already out of the hall and waiting for that ladder! The men are back from the cinema. The patrol might come along any moment. Hurry!\u0027Bourke pulled the ladder out of the car boot. He climbed on to the roof of his car, swung the folded ladder with his right arm three times and then tossed it over the wall.Blake tumbled awkwardly and smashed his head on the gravel when he made it over the wall, but Bourke dragged him to the car, opened the rear door and pushed him into the back seat.Rain was beating down on the car as they drove away. Bourke put his foot down.Blake\u0027s forehead was bleeding, his left wrist was broken and bent at an ugly angle, but he was too elated to feel much pain.A huge manhunt failed to find him. While the country\u0027s ports were watched and his photograph was displayed on television and the front pages, Blake was lying low in a nearby bedsit.He was eventually smuggled across the Channel by Randle in a camper van, then across northern Europe and through West Germany to the border crossing. In East Germany, he identified himself to the border guards and completed his escape to Russia.Arrving in Moscow in January 1967, Blake did not take long to recognise that communism in the Soviet Union was an utter failure. The deprivations of The Scrubs prepared him well for the endless shortages. Two months after his arrival, he discovered Gillian had been granted a orce in his absence.Blake stayed at first in a spacious KGB apartment with a housekeeper to prepare his meals. He spent his days writing long memos for the authorities, compiling information he had been unable to pass on before his arrest, as well as details of how the British had interrogated him.Life improved markedly when, on a Volga riverboat cruise in the spring of 1968, he met Ida, a Russian woman who worked as a French translator for an economics institution. The two settled down together in a spacious apartment organised by the KGB and Blake was given privileges and medical benefits similar to a military general. After the birth of their son, Mischa, in 1971, he was presented with a dacha, a holiday home, in the countryside around Moscow.For more than 30 years he worked at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, a leading Moscow think-tank.When the Berlin Wall came down and the Cold War ended, Blake seemed to think he would be forgiven back home. He was soon disabused.In fact, according to Markus Wolfe, the head of the former East German spy agency, lifting the Iron Curtain served only to shrink Blake\u0027s world still further.He was left to \u0027live out a withdrawn life in an adopted homeland that had abandoned his cause\u0027.Today, aged 96, his eyesight has faded to the point that he is nearly blind. Many former KGB officers have dachas in the area and neighbours are protective.Blake\u0027s wooden house is on a corner plot behind a tall fence and is watched over by a friendly caretaker with a beret, and a small white schnauzer, Plushka.Inside the four-bedroom dacha the decor is simple and it is kept cosy all year round by central heating.Blake still ventures out for walks with Ida, 13 years his junior, hunched over and holding her arm.Because his eyesight is so poor, he can no longer watch the BBC via satellite as he used to, so Ida reads to him.In addition to Mischa, Blake occasionally sees his three English sons, who with Gillian\u0027s blessing began visiting their father in the 1980s and are now close to him.Blake is an honoured figure in Russia, decorated with medals for his espionage, including the Order of Friendship medal in 2007 presented by his admirer, President Putin.He is lionised by the Russian press, which calls him the \u0027grave digger of British intelligence\u0027, and carries his occasional pronouncements on the state of the world, usually made during annual birthday interviews with official organs.\u0027The American empire will disappear because everyone who lives by the sword dies from the sword,\u0027 he told Izvestia, the official government newspaper, in 2010.Blake\u0027s 90th birthday, on November 11, 2012, was a big event, attended by all of his children.In the afternoon came a congratulatory call from Putin, who saluted Blake for his \u0027enormous contribution to the preservation of peace\u0027, declaring that the spy had earned a place in the \u0027constellation of strong and courageous men\u0027.Yet the praise from Putin is a source of discomfort for Blake. He has told friends that he loathes the Russian president and the cynical and violent authoritarian rule he has imposed.Today, in describing his espionage, Blake clings to the fanciful idea that none of the hundreds he betrayed ever came to serious harm. \u0027I challenge anybody . . . to name one who has been executed,\u0027 he wrote.But according to KGB general Oleg Kalugin, who oversaw Blake in Moscow, he has an \u0027innocent mind\u0027. Kalugin recalled that Blake told him several times that the KGB had promised that none of those he identified had been shot.\u0027He clung naively to that belief, and I didn\u0027t have the heart to tell him that his work led directly to the deaths of dozens of agents behind the Iron Curtain,\u0027 Kalugin wrote.Thanks to the astonishing scale of George Blake\u0027s treachery, the Soviets received invaluable information about Western intelligence, its organisation and the people working for it.And thanks to Blake, they knew from the very start about the audacious plan to build a clandestine Berlin spy tunnel right under the feet of our Cold War adversaries – a remarkable story to be recounted in next week\u0027s Mail on Sunday.© Steve Vogel, 2019Betrayal In Berlin by Steve Vogel is published by John Murray on Tuesday, priced £25.

We’ve all seen post-watershed programmes where there is a helpline at the end for people ‘affected by any of the issues seen in the programme’. But this isn’t EastEnders. It’s a programme aimed at children under six.I prefer that an adult is present when my children are watching TV but there will be times when I’m out of the room, changing the baby’s nappy, loading the washing machine or any other number of chores that looking after young children necessitates.Until now, I trusted the BBC to show suitable programmes on CBeebies. Unlike some of the gaudy US children’s programmes on Netflix or Amazon Prime, CBeebies feels safe. There are no ads for overpriced toys and there are shows like Numberblocks, which teach children how to count and so on.One of the pure joys of being a mother to a four-year-old boy – and no doubt a girl, too, but my daughter has only just turned one so I’ve yet to experience that – is seeing the world anew through his complete innocence. Yet, increasingly, organisations seem hellbent on intruding on that innocence with cack-handed explanations of the adult world. Whether it’s a health visitor telling me ‘what a shame’ it is that I’m returning to work while my children are still young (something no one has ever said to my husband) or schools taking it upon themselves to start sex education at an early age, it seems increasingly that parenting is being hijacked by those who claim to know better.As The Mail on Sunday reveals on these pages, a school is even teaching children as young as six about ‘self-stimulation’. This is completely ridiculous. No doubt it comes from good intentions but councils, scurrying to interpret vague national guidelines, are using a heavy-handed approach.Rather than introducing the notion that your private parts are exactly that – yours and private – in a natural way as part of a conversation at home, these issues are being introduced in a classroom environment where children may not understand everything they are being told, nor feel able to ask questions.         The Mail on Sunday reveals a school is even teaching children as young as six about ‘self-stimulation’ (stock image)Yes, there is an important role for schools to play in the emotional education of children, but not in a ham-fisted way that introduces worry and concern where there previously was none. Is it any wonder that the latest NHS figures show that one in eight five to 19-year-olds had at least one mental disorder? Of those, most were emotional disorders. How desperately sad.The assumption that parents can’t be trusted to broach these subjects with their children is exasperating. I’m sure there is a small minority of parents who are feckless, but the overwhelming majority are doing a decent job. Often a great job. Yet organisations seem to cater to the lowest common denominator.Surely parents know their children better than anyone else? And while some six-year-olds may be mature enough to handle certain concepts, others won’t. I am in no way advocating that unpalatable truths should be kept from children. After all, we underestimate these brilliant young minds at our peril. But there is a way of teaching children about the realities of the world without destroying their innocence.My son knows what it means when someone has been ‘burgled’. Why? Because he asked me one day after hearing the word on the news and I told him the truth. He knows ‘bad stuff’ can happen but he has total faith the police will always catch the bad guys. Am I duty-bound to set him straight with the bald truth that most criminals don’t, in fact, get caught? No, of course not.When my mother-in-law died, I didn’t tell him Granny had ‘fallen asleep’. I used the ‘d’ word and gently explained she had been very old and poorly. Did I drive home the point that everyone he knows would one day die? Not a chance. He will figure that out on his own as the world gradually encroaches upon him.As parents, we employ these strategies to protect the innocence of our children. So must broadcasters and educators. My son is aware that some of his friends don’t have daddies and they’re perfectly happy. But why should a CBeebies programme make him anxious that he doesn’t know who his ‘real Daddy’ is?While organisations like schools and the BBC are on a misguided mission to ‘inform’ children about modern life, they are wrecking childhood.It’s ill-thought-out, it’s wrong and it’s totally unnecessary. The BBC said last night: ‘Our ambition is to reflect and represent the reality of life in the UK across our content and services.‘It is, therefore, only right our children’s programmes reflect the ersity of families, which we always do in a sensitive and age-appropriate way.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Marks Spencer slashes prices prepares launch grocery delivery service","story":"Share this article M\u0026ampS bosses are understood to have discussed the price cuts with Ocado.

Glasgow is at the centre of that spike: at 73.3 years, male life expectancy in the city is the lowest in western Europe, which has given rise to the term “the Glasgow effect”. Going beyond the poverty and deprivation that are the main causes of poor health in any society, the report flags up other contributing factors, in particular Glasgow’s controversial housing policy in the 1970s.That policy – of breaking up working-class neighbourhoods and rehousing their inhabitants in estates on the edges of town – cut people adrift from their community support networks and left them particularly vulnerable to the mass unemployment of the 80s. “There was so much disruption in housing, working-class communities lost their roots,” says Mackay, who herself grew up in Glasgow. “People had to start all over again.”Mackay’s project focuses on iniduals whose life and experiences “tell part of the city’s story”, including those from the “big four” estates – Pollok, Drumchapel, Castlemilk and Easterhouse. There’s Billy McMillan, for example, an articulate young man from Easterhouse whose teachers ruled out further education. There’s Wee John, pictured on the border between Drumchapel and Bearsden, where male life expectancy varies massively depending on which side of the ide you’re on.Then there’s Liz, a young woman who lost her partner to suicide in 2015, a not uncommon experience. Suicide rates are higher in Glasgow than in any other Scottish city, and are considerably higher in Scotland than in England.“Suicide came up again and again,” says Mackay. “I couldn’t ignore it. What I wanted to do was photograph the people who have been left behind – not just the deaths but the impact they have.” She adds that the subject resonates on a personal level: Mackay witnessed two suicides when she was growing up, one on her way home from school. “People taking their own lives, and some of the other things I saw – that has had an effect,” she says. “These are things I had put away, but doing the project has brought them back up again.”“What is it like to come from this place, as opposed to any other place, and how does that shape you?” Mackay asks in her introduction to The Fish That Never Swam its title is taken from Glasgow’s coat of arms, and also evokes the idea that, just as a fish is not aware of the water it swims in, it’s hard for an inidual to grasp the impact their environment has on them. “That’s why I wanted to photograph a baby,” says Mackay. “I wanted to make a point about your place of birth and how it affects your life.”Born in Maryhill, Mackay moved to Partick with her family when she was three, and grew up in a working-class tenement block near the River Clyde. Partick was a mixed area next to the more prosperous Hillhead district, and Mackay says that growing up seeing those differences made a difference. “There was a lot of ersity, and I definitely aspired to have one of the houses at the top of the hill,” she says. “That’s what you don’t get in these peripheral estates.”Encouraged by a teacher, Mackay studied photography at Glasgow College before leaving for New York and London to work as assistant to photographers including Herb Ritts, Nick Knight and Anton Corbijn. She has an MA in documentary photography from the prestigious school of photography at the University of Wales and has said that her work is fuelled by “injustice on any scale”. Now settled in Bristol, she published her first book, My Favourite Colour Was Yellow, an exploration of the colour pink and the way it’s pressed on young girls, in 2017.Mackay’s accent may have softened over the years since she left but, she says, Glasgow still feels like home – and her mother still lives in the flat she grew up in. “I’m an insider and an outsider,” she says. “When I was making this work I was really aware of that.”That sense of being an outsider meant she sometimes questioned her right to make the series, but two factors spurred her on. First, she wanted to get the research from the Glasgow Centre out to the wider public, “because there was only a couple of articles about it in the papers”. But second, she hopes to add more insight from her subjects, because “it’s the people with lived experience that have the answers.“I’m travelling all around the city, talking, and most crucially listening, to a erse group of people,” she says. “I see myself a bit like a conductor bringing all these voices and life experiences together my hope is that the result will be a chorus of voices that point the way to the next chapter of action.” To this end, the series will be published as a book next year and there’s also a documentary film in the making.Mackay says she usually takes the time to get to know her subjects, collaborating with them on their portraits and frequently photographing them at home. One lady wanted to get her hair done and change her outfit before their session, for example, another wanted to be shot looking sultry. “She said ‘When I die, use this picture of me at the funeral,’” says Mackay. “That’s really the highest compliment.”She works this way not only because she doesn’t want to depict her subjects as victims but also because it’s important that the images reflect the sense of personal pride that people in Glasgow have, despite – or perhaps because of – the challenging circumstances in which some of them live. “People take a lot of care over how they present themselves to the world. Their houses are spotless and they put money into dressing their kids,” she says. “It’s something they have power over.”Kirsty Mackay will be showing work from this project as part of the group show Distinctly at the Williamson Art Gallery and Museum in Birkenhead, Wirral, 28 September to 24 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b70cf2a957e8c40a8250178e47e6047a15dd28e4/38_162_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb9029d392a63e7e0e12fb9bcf8e1078 1900w","title":"in it to win it why are we so obsessed with quizzes","story":"The return of the classic quiz show Blockbusters reflects our love of knowledge tests. Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

For a good while he remained on his back (not his favourite posture) and regarded his distant feet, his paucity of limbs, with consternation. A mere four, of course, and quite unmovable. His own little brown legs, for which he was already feeling some nostalgia, would have been waving merrily in the air, however hopelessly. He lay still, determined not to panic. An organ, a slab of slippery meat, lay squat and wet in his mouth – revolting, especially when it moved of its own accord to explore the vast cavern of his mouth and, he noted with muted alarm, slide across an immensity of teeth. He stared along the length of his body. His colouring, from shoulders to ankles, was a pale blue, with darker blue piping around his neck and wrists, and white buttons in a vertical line right down his unsegmented thorax. The light breeze that blew intermittently across it, bearing a not unattractive odour of decomposing food and grain alcohol, he accepted as his breath. His vision was unhelpfully narrowed – oh for a compound eye – and everything he saw was oppressively colourful. He was beginning to understand that by a grotesque reversal his vulnerable flesh now lay outside his skeleton, which was therefore wholly invisible to him. What a comfort it would have been to catch a glimpse of that homely nacreous brown.All this was worrying enough, but as he came more fully awake he remembered that he was on an important, solitary mission, though for the moment he could not recall what it was. I’m going to be late, he thought, as he attempted to lift from the pillow a head that must have weighed as much as five kilos. This is so unfair, he told himself. I don’t deserve this. His fragmentary dreams had been deep and wild, haunted by raucous, echoing voices in constant dissent. Only now, as this head slumped back, did he begin to see through to the far side of sleep and bring to mind a mosaic of memories, impressions and intentions that scattered as he tried to hold them down.Yes, he had left the pleasantly decaying Palace of Westminster without even a farewell. That was how it had to be. Secrecy was all. He had known that without being told. But when exactly had he set out? Certainly it was after dark. Last night? The night before? He must have left by the underground car park. He would have passed the polished boots of the policeman at the entrance. Now he remembered. Keeping to the gutter, he had hurried along until he had reached the edge of the terrifying crossing in Parliament Square. In front of a line of idling vehicles impatient to pestle him into the tarmac, he made a dash for the gutter on the far side. After which, it seemed a week passed before he crossed another terrifying road to reach the correct side of Whitehall. Then what? He had sprinted, surely, for many yards and then stopped. Why? It was coming back to him now. Breathing heavily through every tube in his body, he had rested near a wholesome drain to snack on a discarded slice of pizza. He couldn’t eat it all, but he did his best. By good luck it was a margherita. His second favourite. No olives. Not on that portion.It’s a satirical novella written from that point where despair and laughter meet.The accumulation of misleading statements and lies made to voters about the benefits of leaving the EU.I wrote The Cockroach during July and August this year.

He turned it now to one side. It was a small attic bedroom, unpleasantly lit by the morning sun, for the curtains had not been drawn. There was a telephone at his bedside, no, two telephones. His constricted gaze travelled across the carpet to settle on the skirting board and the narrow gap along its lower edge. I might have squeezed under there out of the morning light, he thought sadly. I could have been happy. Across the room there was a sofa and by it, on a low table, a cut-glass tumbler and an empty bottle of scotch. Laid out over an armchair was a suit and a laundered, folded shirt. On a larger table near the window were two box files, one sitting on top of the other, both coloured red.He was getting the hang of moving his eyes, now that he understood the way they smoothly swivelled together without his help. Rather than letting his tongue hang out beyond his lips, where it dripped from time to time on to his chest, he found it was more comfortably housed within the oozing confines of his mouth. Horrible. But he was acquiring the knack of steering his new form. He was a quick learner. What troubled him was the need to set about his business. There were important decisions to be taken. Suddenly, a movement on the floor caught his attention. It was a little creature, in his own previous form, no doubt the displaced owner of the body he now inhabited. He watched with a degree of protective interest as the tiny thing struggled over the strands of pile carpet, towards the door. There it hesitated, its twin antennae waving uncertainly with all of a beginner’s ineptitude. Finally, it gathered its courage and stumbled under the door to begin a difficult, perilous descent. It was a long way back to the palace, and there would be much danger along the way. But if it made it without being squashed underfoot, it would find, behind the palace panelling or below the floorboards, safety and solace among millions of its siblings. He wished it well. But now he must attend to his own concerns.And yet Jim did not stir. Nothing made sense, all movement was pointless until he could piece together the journey, the events, that had led him to an unfamiliar bedroom. After that chance meal he had scuttled along, barely conscious of the bustle above him, minding his own business as he hugged the shadows of the gutter, though for how long and how far was beyond recall. What he knew for certain was that he reached at last an obstacle that towered over him, a small mountain of dung, still warm and faintly steaming. Any other time, he would have rejoiced. He regarded himself as something of a connoisseur. He knew how to live well. This particular consignment he could instantly place. Who could mistake that nutty aroma, with hints of petroleum, banana skin and saddle soap. The Horse Guards! But what a mistake, to have eaten between meals. The margherita had left him with no appetite for excrement, however fresh or distinguished, nor any inclination, given his gathering exhaustion, to clamber all the way over it. He crouched in the mountain’s shadow, on the springy ground of its foothills, and considered his options. After a moment’s reflection, it was clear what he must do. He set about scaling the vertical granite wall of the kerb in order to circumvent the heap and descend on its far side.Reclining now in the attic bedroom, he decided that this was the point at which he had parted company with his own free will, or the illusion of it, and had come under the influence of a greater, guiding force. Mounting the pavement, as he did, he submitted to the collective spirit. He was a tiny element in a scheme of a magnitude that no single inidual could comprehend.He heaved himself on to the top of the kerb, noting that the droppings extended a third of the way across the pavement. Then, out of nowhere, there came down upon him a sudden storm, the thunder of 10,000 feet, and chants and bells, whistles and trumpets. Yet another rowdy demonstration. So late in the evening. Loutish people making trouble when they should have been at home. Nowadays, these protests were staged almost every week. Disrupting vital services, preventing ordinary decent types from going about their lawful business. He froze on the kerb, expecting to be squashed at any moment. The soles of shoes 15 times his own length slammed the ground inches from where he cowered and made his antennae and the pavement tremble. How fortunate for him that at one point he chose to look up, entirely in the spirit of fatalism. He was prepared to die. But that was when he saw an opportunity – a gap in the procession. The next wave of protesters was 50 yards away. He saw their banners streaming, their flags bearing down, yellow stars on a blue ground. Union Jacks too. He had never scuttled so fast in his life. Breathing hard through all the trachea on his body segments, he gained the other side by a heavy iron gate seconds before they were on him again with thunderclaps of hideous tramping, and now catcalls and savage drumbeats. Seized by mortal fear and indignation, an inconvenient mix, he darted off the pavement and, to save his life, squeezed under the gate into the sanctuary and relative tranquillity of a side street where he instantly recognised the heel of a standard issue policeman’s boot. Reassuring, as ever.Then what? He proceeded along the empty pavement, past a row of exclusive residences. Here he was surely fulfilling the plan. The collective pheromonal unconscious of his kind bestowed on him an instinctive understanding of his direction of travel. After half an hour of uneventful progress, he paused, as he was meant to do. On the far side of the street was a group of a hundred or so photographers and reporters. On his side, he was level with and close by a door, outside which stood yet another policeman. And just then, that door swung open and a woman in high heels stepped out, almost spearing him right through his ninth and tenth abdominal segments. The door remained open. Perhaps a visitor was arriving. In those few seconds Jim looked into a welcoming, softly lit hallway, with skirting boards somewhat scuffed – always a good sign. On a sudden impulse that he now knew was not his own, he ran in.He was doing well, given his unusual circumstances, lying on this unfamiliar bed, to recall such details. It was good to know that his brain, his mind, was much as it had always been. He remained, after all, his essential self. It was the surprising presence of a cat that had caused him to run, not in the direction of the skirting boards, but towards the stairs. He climbed three and looked back. The cat, a brown and white tabby, had not seen him, but Jim considered it dangerous to descend. So began his long climb. On the first floor there were too many people walking along the landing, in and out of rooms. More prospect of being trodden to death. An hour later, when he reached the second floor, the carpets were being vigorously vacuumed. He knew of many souls who had been lost that way, sucked into dusty oblivion. No choice but to keep on climbing until – but now, suddenly, here in the attic, all his thoughts were obliterated by the harsh ringing of one of the bedside telephones. Even though he found that he could at last move one of his limbs, an arm, he did not stir. He couldn’t trust his voice. And even if he could, what would he say? I’m not who you think I am? After four rings the phone went silent.He lay back and allowed his frantic heart to settle. He practised moving his legs. At last, they stirred. But barely an inch. He tried again with an arm, and raised it until it towered far above his head. So, back to the story. He had heaved himself up the last step to arrive breathless on the top landing. He squeezed under the nearest door into a small apartment. Usually, he would have made straight for the kitchen but instead he climbed a bedpost and, utterly depleted, crept under a pillow. He must have slept deeply for – but now, dammit, there came a tapping sound and before he could respond, the door to the bedroom was opening. A young woman in a beige trouser suit stood on the threshold and gave a brisk nod before entering.“I tried phoning but I thought I’d better come up. Prime minister, it’s almost 7.30.”He could think of no response.The woman, clearly an aide of some kind, came into the room and picked up the empty bottle. Her manner was rather too familiar.“Quite an evening, I see.”It would not have done to remain silent for long. From his bed he aimed for an inarticulate sound, somewhere between a groan and a croak. Not bad. Higher pitched than he would have wanted, with a hint of a chirrup, but plausible enough.The aide was gesturing towards the larger table, at the red boxes. “I don’t suppose you had a chance to, uh…”He played it safe by making the same sound again, this time on a lower note.“Perhaps after breakfast you could take a … I should remind you. It’s Wednesday. Cabinet at nine. Priorities for government and PMQs at noon.”Prime Minister’s Questions. How many of those he had crouched through, listening enthralled from behind the rotten wainscoting in the company of a few thousand select acquaintances? How familiar he was with the opposition leader’s shouted questions, the brilliant non sequitur replies, the festive jeers and clever imitations of sheep. It would be a dream come true, to be primo uomo in the weekly operetta. But was he adequately prepared? No less than anyone else, surely. Not after a quick glance at the papers. Like many of his kind, he rather fancied himself at the dispatch box. He would be fast on his feet, even though he only had two.In the space where once he sported a fine mandible, the unwholesome slab of dense tissue stirred and his first human word rolled out.“I’ll have your coffee ready downstairs.”He had often sipped coffee in the dead of night on the tea room floor. It tended to keep him awake in the day, but he enjoyed the taste and preferred it milky, with four sugars. He assumed this was generally known by his staff.As soon as the aide had left the room, he pushed away the covers and managed at last to swing his tuberous legs on to the carpet. He stood at last at a vertiginous height, swaying slightly, with his soft, pale hands pressed to his forehead, and groaning again. Minutes later, making his unsteady way towards the bathroom, those same hands began nimbly to remove his pyjamas. He stepped out of them to stand on pleasantly heated tiles. It rather amused him, passing water thunderously into a specially prepared ceramic bowl, and his spirits lifted. But when he turned to confront the mirror over the handbasin, they sank again. The bristling oval disk of a face, wobbling on a thick pink stalk of neck, repelled him. The pinprick eyes shocked him. The inflated rim of darker flesh that framed an array of off-white teeth disgusted him. But I’m here for a proud cause and I’ll put up with anything, he reassured himself as he watched his hands turn the taps and reach for his shaving brush and soap.Five minutes later he felt nauseated as he paused, still swaying, before the prospect of putting on the clothes laid out for him. His own sort took great pride in their beautiful, gleaming bodies and would never have thought to cover them up. White underpants, black socks, a blue and white striped shirt, dark suit, black shoes. He observed with detachment the automatic speed with which his hands tied his laces, and then, back at the bathroom mirror, his tie. As he combed his gingery brown hair, he noticed with sudden homesickness that it was the same colour as his good old shell. At least something has survived of my looks, was his melancholy thought as, finally, he stood at the top of the stairs.He began a dizzying descent, trusting his legs to carry him down safely as he had his hands to shave and dress him. He kept a firm grip on the bannisters, smothering a groan at each step. As he crossed the landings, where there were hairpin turns, he clung on with both hands. He could have passed for a man with a hangover. But what had taken an hour to climb up took only seven minutes to climb down. Waiting for him in the hallway at the foot of the stairs was a group of very young men and women, each holding a folder. Respectfully they murmured, “Good morning, prime minister,” in a soft, uneven chorus. None of them dared look at him directly while they waited for him to speak.He cleared his throat and managed to say, “Let’s get on, shall we.” He was stuck for any further remark, but luckily a fellow, older than the rest and wearing a suit as expensive-looking as his own, pushed through and, seizing Jim by the elbow, propelled him along the corridor.A door swung open and they went through. “Your coffee’s in here.”They were in the Cabinet room. Halfway down the long table by the largest chair was a tray of coffee, which the prime minister approached with such avidity that over the last few steps he broke into a run. He hoped to arrive ahead of his companion and snatch a moment with the sugar bowl. But by the time he was lowering himself into the chair, with minimal decorum, his coffee was being poured. There was no sugar on the tray. Not even milk. But in the grey shadow cast by his saucer, visible only to him, was a dying bluebottle. Every few seconds its wings trembled. With some effort, Jim wrenched his gaze away while he listened. He was beginning to think he might sneeze.“About the 1922 Committee. The usual bloody suspects.”When the bluebottle’s wings shook they made the softest rustle of acquiescence.“I’m glad you weren’t there.”When a bluebottle has been dead for more than 10 minutes it tastes impossibly bitter. Barely alive or just deceased, it has a cheese flavour. Stilton, mostly.“It’s a mutiny. And all over the morning papers.”There was nothing to be done. The prime minister had to sneeze. He had felt it building. Probably the lack of dust. He gripped the chair. For an explosive instant he thought he had passed out.“Bless you. There was talk of a no-confidence vote.”When he opened his unhelpfully lidded eyes, the fly had gone. Blown away. “Fuck.”“That’s what I thought.”“Where is it? I mean, where’s the sense in –”“The usual. You’re a closet Clockwiser. Not with the Project. Not a true go-it-alone man. Getting nothing through parliament. Zero backbone. That sort of thing.”Jim drew his cup and saucer towards him. No. He lifted the stainless steel pot. Not under there either.“I’m as Reversalist as any of them.”By his silence his special adviser, if that was what he was, appeared to disagree. Then he said, “We need a plan. And quick.”It was only now that the Welsh accent was evident. Wales? A small country far to the west, hilly, rain-sodden, treacherous. Jim was finding that he knew things, different things. He knew differently. His understanding, like his vision, was narrowed. He lacked the broad and instant union with the entirety of his kind, the boundless resource of the oceanic pheromonal. But he had finally remembered in full his designated mission.“What do you suggest?”There came a loud single rap, the door opened and a tall man with a generous jaw, bottle-black swept-back hair and pinstripe suit strode in.“Jim, Simon. Mind if I join you? Bad news. Encryption just in from –”Simon interrupted. “Benedict, this is private. Kindly bugger off.”Without a shift in expression, the foreign secretary turned and left the room, closing the door behind him with exaggerated care.“What I resent,” Simon said, “about these privately educated types is their sense of entitlement. Excluding you, of course.”“Quite. What’s the plan?”“You’ve said it yourself. Take a step towards the hardliners, they scream for more. Give them what they want, they piss on you. Things go wrong with the Project, they blame anyone and everyone. Especially you.”“There’s a wobble in the public mood. The focus groups are telling a new story. Our pollster phoned in the results last night. There’s general weariness. Creeping fear of the unknown. Anxiety about what they voted for, what they’ve unleashed.’“I heard about those results,” the prime minister lied. It was important to maintain face.“Here’s the point. We should isolate the hardliners. Confidence motion my arse! Prorogue parliament for a few months. Astound the bastards. Or even better, change tack. Swing –”“I mean it. You’ve got to swing –”“Yes! Parliament will fall at your feet. You’ll have a majority – just.”“But the will of the p–”“Fuck the lot of them. Gullible wankers. It’s a parliamentary democracy and you’re in charge. The house is stalled. The country’s tearing itself apart. We had that ultra-Reversalist beheading a Clockwise MP in a supermarket. A Clockwise yob pouring milkshake over a high-profile Reversalist.”“That was shocking,” the prime minister agreed. “His blazer had only just been cleaned.”“The whole thing’s a mess. Jim, time to call it off.” Then he added softly, “It’s in your power.”The PM stared into his adviser’s face, taking it in for the first time. It was narrow and long, hollow at the temples, with little brown eyes and a tight rosebud mouth. He had a grey three-day beard and wore trainers and a black silk suit over a Superman T-shirt.“What you’re saying is very interesting,” the PM said at last.“It’s my job to keep you in office and this is the only way.”“It’d be a… a…” Jim struggled for the word. He knew several variants in pheromone, but they were fading. Then he had it. “A U-turn!”“Not quite. I’ve been back through some of your speeches. Enough there to get you off the hook. Difficulties. Doubts. Delays. Sort of stuff the hardliners hate you for. Shirley can prepare the ground.”“Very interesting indeed.” Jim stood up and stretched.“I need to talk to Shirley myself before Cabinet. And I’ll need a few minutes alone.”He began to walk round the long table towards the door. He was coming to feel some pleasure in his stride and a new sense of control. Improbable as it had seemed, it was possible to feel stable on only two feet. It hardly bothered him to be so far off the ground. And he was glad now not to have eaten a bluebottle in another man’s presence. It might not have gone down well.Simon said, “I’ll wait for your thoughts, then.”Jim reached the door and let the fingers of one strange hand rest lightly on the handle. Yes, he could drive this soft new machine. He turned, taking pleasure in doing it slowly, until he was facing the adviser, who had not moved from his chair.“You can have them now. I want your resignation letter on my desk within the half hour and I want you out of the building by 11.”• This is an extract from Ian McEwan’s latest book, The Cockroach, which will be published on 27 September by Vintage (£7.99).

Aside from wrangling over its position on Brexit, Labour has been devising the most radical rethink of business’s role in the economy and society since the 1980s.There’s plenty more – and this should be no surprise. McDonnell and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have waited decades for a chance to run the country and probably thought it would never come. If they make it to Downing Street, why would the veteran leftwingers tinker at the edges?The Confederation of British Industry is taking Labour seriously and will be doing the rounds at Labour’s party conference in Brighton this week, where Long-Bailey, a Corbyn ally, is likely to announce plans to boost infrastructure and manufacturing.Josh Hardie, the CBI’s deputy director general, said the lobby group held regular meetings with Corbyn and McDonnell, and his members supported ideas such as infrastructure, “engaging” with workers, and investing in skills. Business also prefers Labour’s version of Brexit – staying as close as possible to the EU – to the Tories’ willingness to crash out.But Hardie has concerns, too: “Often the Labour solutions are ideological rather than based on evidence. We don’t agree with their approach because we think it will have damaging consequences for our country and communities.”He added that nationalisation would be a big distraction on top of Brexit and, along with giving workers shares, would send the wrong signal to investors. The economy, he said, was too fragile to increase the burden of taxes and wages on businesses.If anything, received wisdom is swinging in Labour’s direction. You don’t have to be a Marxist to believe capitalism has big problems. The financial crisis, the climate emergency and the rise of populism have left business leaders wringing their hands about how to save capitalism from itself.Last month, Apple, Amazon and Wall Street bank JPMorgan were among 200 big US companies that redefined their purpose as “improving our society” and not just making money for shareholders. Similar debates are taking place in the UK.Carys Roberts, chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, said: “The policies that are being proposed aren’t actually as radical as some people are making out.“There is a growing recognition in quite unexpected circles that the way capitalism is set up isn’t working for most people and that there needs to be a sea change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01bc36c1a21b0a56ded47789756658f97d888c36/622_774_5481_3288/master/5481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e42a7e9eb81d6e5d082cacb213308814","title":"brexit arlene foster dup leader europe","story":"You may not realise it, but Arlene Foster is one of the most powerful politicians in contemporary Europe. In the bizarre and tumultuous state of British politics, this fact is one that will stand among the most historically significant. It is an extraordinary situation. Foster is a member of a regional legislative assembly that hasn’t sat for nearly 1,000 days, the leader of a party with just 10 MPs, and the subject of an inquiry that may well see the end of her political career within weeks.But at this time, she holds the key to Brexit. And the stability of the pound, the constitution of the UK, the size of the European Union and the future of the continent are in no small way affected by her decisions.So what is Foster proposing? Her apparent acceptance of a Northern Ireland-only solution stands out in luminescent colours from her recent comments in Dublin. But we should not assume that this clears the way for a Northern Ireland-specific backstop returning to the table, and thus speeding us through to the withdrawal agreement.Having spent the past two years being decisive about very little, other than resistance and naysaying, Foster is now under a great deal of pressure to move away from her “blood-red line” against any post-Brexit differential between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Even those pushing alternative arrangements acknowledge that there is no way around putting some controls in the Irish Sea after Brexit. It was in Dublin, of all places, last week, where Foster decided to push forward. The question being asked across the European continent now is: how far did she move?In some ways, it could be seen to be a moot point. If Boris Johnson can lose almost two dozen of his party’s MPs without so much as a shrug, why would he worry too much about what the DUP thinks? The loss of the confidence of the DUP, which long failed to supply his predecessor with the promised votes, is hardly a game-changer.But the truth is that what the DUP does now will have a determining role in Northern Ireland’s future – for better or worse. And, with that, it will shape the whole outcome of Brexit, including whether it leads, sooner or later, to the dissolution of the United Kingdom itself.It is absolutely critical that Foster brings unionism with her in accepting the prospect of distinctive treatment for Northern Ireland. This is no small task. Unionism has rallied behind the notion that the withdrawal agreement is anathema to the union itself. Polls have shown that, in the space of a year, support for the backstop among unionists in Northern Ireland has plummeted. This is in no small part owing to the antagonism towards it led by Foster herself.There is a risk that the UK could exit the EU with a deal but at the cost of stability in Northern Ireland. If unionists are left feeling betrayed by the DUP, then perhaps the party could seek to regain credibility by offloading Foster as leader. But if unionists are left feeling shafted by the British government, then it means a breakdown of trust that will be incredibly difficult to restore.Of course, the nature of Northern Ireland means that this tension works both ways. If the pressure for a deal sees the Irish government concede so much on the withdrawal agreement that nationalists in Northern Ireland feel exposed and vulnerable, then this too would rock the foundations of the peace process.Looking more closely at what Foster said in Dublin, it remains fairly clear that the tension that has always been there in DUP (and Conservative party) aspirations for Brexit remains absolutely entrenched: that is, the stubborn belief that it is possible for the UK to leave the single market and customs union yet there be no trade barriers within the UK, and frictionless trade on the island of Ireland.The backstop cut through this tension but left unionists and Brexiters feeling hard done by. But the backstop is a notion and term that is more toxic for unionists than that of “all-island arrangements”.Indeed, Foster notes that the DUP “recognises the unique history and geography” of Northern Ireland, which in turn gives a certain logic to specific arrangements for Northern Ireland. While this is something the party has flatly contradicted in repeated comments over the past year, it can also claim that this has long been its position.In its 2017 manifesto, the DUP sought Northern Ireland-specific solutions, and it wanted to see the “particular circumstances of Northern Ireland” fully reflected in the negotiations.It is significant that there are strong similarities between these aims and those of all the other main parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin has long argued for special designated status for the region. The Alliance party has argued for a special deal for Northern Ireland. The SDLP has argued for its “bespoke” status. And the Ulster Unionists have sought its designation as a special enterprise zone.If Foster can now act to solidify this common ground between nationalists, unionists and others in Northern Ireland, and if she can steer a path towards an acceptable withdrawal agreement and future deal, it would be a rare and momentous act of leadership that could change the course of European history.• Katy Hayward is reader in sociology at Queen’s University Belfast and author of Bordering on Brexit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7726e076dd2bb6110acc55a79a9bdc134dd9a266/0_0_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa03182dab6d589a0d79eae619ada044","title":"golden toilets golden arches as for david cameron","story":"Like the thieves who stole the glittering khazi, our memoir-hawking former prime minister seems to have got off scot-freeLike most people, I enjoyed the news of the theft of that gold toilet. I’m glad the gold toilet exists (or existed) and I’m glad it was stolen. After all, if it hadn’t been stolen, I probably wouldn’t know it exists. I’m also glad it was stolen from Blenheim Palace, that colossally vulgar stately home, because it’s exactly the kind of place you imagine might have gold toilets.It only slightly spoils it that it doesn’t. The loos at Blenheim are, as far as I know, made from conventional materials. The gold loo, as well as being a loo, is a work of conceptual art and was part of an exhibition of other works of art that weren’t also loos, or also gold. So the gold loo wasn’t already there. Winston Churchill never s(h)at on it, though he was born just across the hall. On a non-gold bed, I regret to say.But it’s a proper loo. It’s not just loo-shaped, it was a working loo before the burglars ripped it out. Visitors were each offered a three-minute go on it, which I reckon is rushing it for a poo (and a poo is obviously what most people would want to do in a gold loo – I mean, that’s the anecdote), but plenty of time for a wee, the yellowness of which would presumably be hard to discern. A poo would show up brilliantly though and definitely be all sorts of metaphors.Again, slightly spoiling it, the artist, Maurizio Cattelan, is ahead of us here. He offered the loo to Donald Trump and he’s called it America. So, you know, he’s doing the joke. And Donald Trump turned it down, which suggests even that idiot senses ribaldry because there’s no doubt that, stripped of the potential metaphorical implications, he would definitely like to have a gold loo. Interior design by King Midas is absolutely Trump’s domestic style and his penthouse is probably the only place on Earth more likely than Blenheim Palace to have a solid gold khazi.But it’s still a great story, made more so by the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, and the current Duke of Marlborough’s half-brother, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, having said of the loo last month: “It’s not going to be the easiest thing to nick.” True – that would probably be a pen from a meeting or a Twix from a newsagent. But traditionally thieves are willing to make a bit more of an effort for things that are made of solid, 18-carat gold.“Firstly, it’s plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate,” Lord Edward continued. “So no, I don’t plan to be guarding it.” I’m not sure he’d be the man for the job anyway. Get some sort of professional security would be my advice. And I’m not entirely clear why the thieves would need to know the identity or diet of the lavatory’s previous occupant or why ignorance of those things would deter them. Does he just mean that no one would want to pinch all that gold because it might have poo and wee on it? Where there’s muck there’s brass, your lordship.I can’t help wishing the thieves luck. At the time of writing, two people have been arrested, but there’s still no sign of the missing bog and I hope whoever did it gets away with it. There’s not much harm in that, is there? It doesn’t make me an anarchist. It just seems fun, like an Ealing comedy. I reckon I’d probably always have felt like that about it.I’m not convinced, though. Another story made me doubt myself. This was last week’s news that McDonald’s has applied for planning permission to open a branch in Rutland, the only county in Britain that doesn’t yet have one. Unsurprisingly, some Rutlanders are up in arms at the prospect.“Please don’t do this to our beautiful county. Let’s stay the only county without one of these,” implored resident Charnelle Els, while Joanna Aitkens told the council: “I’ve heard that it would bring Rutland into the 21st century. I’m sure that even McDonald’s would think that it’s a sad world that pins its hopes on a cheap burger and fries to offer modernity and prosperity to a county.” If McDonald’s does think that, it’s sliding into corporate self-loathing. Meanwhile, David Taylor said: “It will be an eyesore and attract the wrong sort of people.”I’m afraid this made me start hoping Rutland does get a McDonald’s. All the complaining made me think: “Why shouldn’t they have to have one like everyone else?” It made me want to prick their picturesque bubble so that the whole county is full of McDonald’s and nail bars and Ladbrokes and Wetherspoons, but not a single post office, just like everywhere else.I was surprised by my own spite and it made me question my motives for liking the lavatory theft. Maybe I wasn’t really attracted to the enterprising underdog, but I’m just pleased when things go wrong. Maybe, amid all the turmoil and ision of the last few years, I’m turning nasty.Which brings me to David Cameron. The former prime minister has been cutting a surprisingly sympathetic figure as he plugs his book, with apparently wholehearted contrition for some of his most egregious failures and beguilingly expressed condemnation of the arseholes those failures brought to power.But the consequences keep mounting. Millions of us feel more confused, worried, conflicted, angry and just plain mean than ever before. David Dimbleby said last week: “I lived through Suez, the miners’ strike, I lived through the poll tax debate and… the Iraq demonstrations – I’ve never seen the country so ided as this.”That’s more David Cameron’s fault than anyone else’s. Yet, in terms of image, he’s the beneficiary of his own blunders. He let the country down so catastrophically, and such ignoble fools and villains have come to prominence as a result, that, next to them, he looks comparatively statesmanlike. He stands tidily beside the mess he made. Like a bewildered aristocrat whose loo has been ripped out in the night, the clumsy and selfish architect of the wreckage surveys it in a spotless shirt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c4d22c148bd69ac716796164d5e99be4680ae1b/0_0_5050_3030/master/5050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce79cb11b36a98f833ceba4537ecf649","title":"jeremy corbyn peoples vote remainers labour election","story":"Essential to the success of any struggle is to recognise when you have won. It is less than a year and a half since the People’s Vote campaign was founded. It has organised mass demonstrations, rallies, petitions its grassroots have leafleted, chanted, sung and often rather pointedly made themselves heard on social media. Their demand was straightforward: any Brexit deal negotiated with the EU should be subject to a confirmatory referendum, with remain as the other option. And that campaign has achieved a dramatic success, compelling Labour to implement its policy if it wins an election. Yet where are the triumphant declarations or the rightly triumphalist victory parties?Labour’s leadership is savaged for inconsistency and zigzagging incomprehensibly, as though it is unique or politically bankrupt in its attempt to manage drastically shifting sands and an ever more polarising culture war. For those of us who campaigned for remain in the referendum, there was a particular problem: there was no mass movement on our side. The official remain campaign was a dire, corporate, status quo outfit that did not understand, and was institutionally incapable of relating to, a deep well of disillusionment in British society.Remain emerged as a mass movement only after the referendum: or, more accurately, after the 2017 election. In the immediate aftermath of June 2016, many remainers were traumatised but resigned to making the result work. The notion of “no deal” was nowhere within the realms of political possibility, and Nigel Farage had extolled the virtues of Norway, which is a member of the single market. Labour’s position – that although the referendum had been lost, the result was close, and a deal should be based on a close relationship with the EU – made sense in a society willing to compromise.Stalwarts of Remainia passionately backed activating article 50, from Anna Soubry to Chuka Umunna, who argued that “to stand against the decision of the country would be to deepen Labour and the country’s isions”. Open Britain – the successor of the official remain campaign – argued for membership of the single market and the customs union. Labour itself fought its election campaign promising to honour the vote and without committing to the single market and customs union, much to the later chagrin of remainers. What changed? The Tory administration in general, and the Tory Brexiteers in particular, treated the referendum result as though they were an all-conquering army, that the winner takes all. Remainers were not only excluded from the process but were systematically humiliated and insulted by the government. Not only was a hard Brexit offered by Theresa May, but the Brexiteers toxified the possibility of any negotiated deal in favour of the delusion of no deal. When May lost her majority, she should have accepted that the British people had delivered a mandate for a compromise, soft Brexit, and worked on a cross-party basis to secure it she did not.While some leading remain figures genuinely saw Brexit as a terrible national tragedy, others saw it as a means to attack the Labour leadership and drive a wedge between it and its members and voters, leading to ever worsening bad blood. The consequences have been a progressively more bitter culture war. But what is striking is how swiftly the polarisation has taken place. It was after the UK didn’t leave the EU on 31 March that the dam truly burst, aided by a European election campaign that rewarded the radical sides of the ide.Labour has made errors. Its failure to make a principled case for freedom of movement has been depressing and cowardly. And while certain politically hostile elements have used Brexit as a stick to beat the leadership, there has been a failure to empathise with those seeing it as a disaster capitalist migrant-bashing project.The party should have moved more quickly and decisively when its compromise position had been destroyed in polling stations across the country in the European elections. A shambolic, misfired attempt to remove Labour’s deputy leader – however authentic the grassroots anger with him is – has only fuelled Corbyn’s enemies.But the People’s Vote campaign has triumphed, and the only viable route to ending Brexit lies in the Tories being displaced by Labour as the party of government. Those who apparently will never be satisfied until Corbyn tattoos the EU flag on his face and camps outside parliament bellowing “Stop Brexit” should consider that the culture war is ripping the social fabric of British society apart.Without an attempt to bridge a toxic ide, an ugly future awaits us all. If – in another referendum – leavers are left feeling like a defeated people presided over by a triumphalist conquering army, the UK will remain a tinderbox. Is demanding Corbyn campaigns passionately for remain, when almost the entire Labour party will do anyway, worth it? The entire political strategy of the UK’s joint prime ministers – Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings – rests on a ided remain vote. Without tackling the injustices that led to this turmoil – as Labour is committed to doing – how will social peace ever be achieved? The truth is Remainia staged an insurrection, and it won. Sometimes you have to accept defeat: what is baffling is, in this case, many seem incapable of accepting victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea17a7aefe0ee7bbc5a3dc04bd68be7464a3dbec/1255_0_4745_2847/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1690c14abcc1401d9ea89b4512305f7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of bored","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘bored’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘bored’.Share your photos of what bored means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 25 September at 10am.

Too much brushing can irritate your scalp and stress your hair, causing it to break and fall out. I recommend brushing long hair a few times a day, not more.The same advice applies to using combs: be gentle and, if your hair is long, hold your hair in your hands and comb the ends out first. Whether you are using a brush or a comb, start from the bottom, then brush in sections, working up towards your scalp.I am a big fan of paddle brushes. I particularly like the Aveda paddle brush, and there is a tiny handbag-sized brush from Boots that is only about £1 but is really good. Paddle brushes give your scalp a little bit of gentle stimulation, though you don’t want to overdo it.If you get dandruff, brushing will help to massage away those dead skin cells. I would always recommend that people with dandruff brush and wash their hair every day.If you have curly hair, of course, combs are better – most people with curly hair will know this already. Although, even if you have curly hair, I would recommend you brush it before you wash it.Whatever your hair type, I would suggest you brush it before you shampoo and then apply conditioner through your hair with your fingers. You want to minimise brushing when it is wet because that is when there is an increased risk of stretching and breaking.Many people with hair loss stop brushing altogether. That is the wrong thing to do. If you are going to lose it, you are going to lose it not brushing only means it sits there for a few days longer than it would anyway. A paddle brush will also contain the hair that has fallen out, rather than having it fall on to the floor or into your hand, which can be psychologically quite difficult.Brushing your hair upside down or shaking your head upside down after you have finished brushing it will help give your hair volume.Sara G Allison, a trichologist and the author of Hair Today, More Tomorrow: How To Keep Your Hair On, was talking to Nell Frizzell"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/665e75a8896956a7c305b6eed7c6938f603865c5/0_0_1755_1756/master/1755.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c51b4488394ec28354bd2da4abd0e770 480w","title":"fancy footwork the 10 best high street boots and shoes in pictures","story":"From heels to trainers, cowboy boots to snakeprint: step out in the season’s finest footwear"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef261702cbd907fff3944fea219149cd16bd3e8c/0_384_5761_3457/master/5761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d781e94fea98c49de9326c0e0e627eb","title":"international incident work mistake official secrets film","story":"It was the Observer’s big scoop of 2003, and as a young journalist, I was asked to type up a top-secret memo. Now my mess-up has made it to the big screenHave you ever wondered who’d play you in a film? I had, occasionally, until the day I got the answer. In spring 2018, a message pinged on to my phone via Facebook from a journalist friend. “So this is a bit weird,” it read. “A sister of a friend is playing you in a movie, apparently. You aware of this?” I wasn’t.“Hanako Footman is playing you in the film Official Secrets. She wants to meet you, like actors do. She saw we were pals and asked if I’d ask you. What did you do in that story?”“That story” concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan – nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq.The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations “particularly directed at… UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)” to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf – the biggest mistake of my career.It’s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b879fc0ceab90888737387723609fb3bf4e1ff79/429_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99aa50fe341acc810e29b1fda9098568","title":"ad astra review brad pitt james gray","story":"Pitt’s tormented astronaut goes in search of his long-lost father in James Gray’s ambitious but slightly hokey sci-fi saga“2001 meets Apocalypse Now” may be the preferred pitch for this self-consciously philosophical science-fiction adventure from James Gray, writer-director of such varied fare as The Yards, Two Lovers and The Lost City of Z, but “Event Horizon with interstellar overdrive” is perhaps a more accurate description.In Paul WS Anderson’s British-made 1997 potboiler Event Horizon, a spaceship powered by a black hole disappeared on its maiden voyage to the stars, popping up years later near Neptune, having apparently gone to hell and back. In Ad Astra, it’s the ghost of the “Lima project” that haunts Neptune’s rings, after vanishing with its cataclysmic antimatter drive decades ago.This time it’s Brad Pitt rather than Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs or Laurence Fishburne (a veteran of Apocalypse Now) on the trail of the cosmic mystery, but the essential thematic coordinates are the same – a trip into deep space in search of a lost expedition that had gazed too long into the abyss. The result is an A-list B-movie that juggles moments of breath-taking visual splendour with much on-the-nose speechifying about sins of the fathers and eternal isolation, spiced up with some action-packed silliness that entirely undercuts its more po-faced pretensions.Just as the makers of Alien looked to Joseph Conrad when naming their spaceships Nostromo and Narcissus, so Gray and co-writer Ethan Gross use Marlow and Kurtz from Heart of Darkness as models for astronaut Roy McBride (Pitt) and his pioneering father Clifford (Tommy Lee Jones). As leader of the Lima project, Cliff “went further than any of us”, travelling to the outskirts of the solar system before going off-grid – physically, morally, theologically. Now Roy (whose “What did he find out there?” narration might as well have been read by Martin Sheen) must follow Dad’s path into the void. Will Roy be able to find the source of the electrical “surges” that are threatening life on Earth? Or will he simply come face to face with “the horror, the horror… ”?From its vertiginous opening sequence, in which the “steady, calm” Roy (whose pulse doesn’t break 80bpm) is knocked from a terrifyingly tall transmitter tower, Gray and Interstellar cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema demonstrate their mastery of experiential film-making. Shot with widescreen majesty on 35mm, Ad Astra combines sinewy, space-bound sequences – all floating elegance and weightless wonder – with moments of shimmery inner stillness, reminiscent of Soderbergh’s undervalued Solaris remake.There are echoes of Gravity, too, as characters find themselves whirling kinetically in the disorienting emptiness of space. And then there’s the trailer-teased encounter with a space-bound “rhesus primate” – a WTF!? episode that bizarrely reminded me that 2001’s visionary effects wiz Douglas Trumbull inherited the movie bug from his father, who rigged those freaky flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz. We may be in “serious” sci-fi territory, Toto, but we can still see Kansas from here...Like Ryan Gosling’s insular Neil Armstrong in Damien Chazelle’s First Man, Pitt’s pathologically “compartmentalised” hero has an almost android-like detachment from human emotions love, fear, empathy. Indeed, this very quality makes him ideal for a mission that would drive a normal human being to distraction. Yet whereas Gosling’s glazed stare silently suggested deep wellsprings of grief, Pitt gets to verbalise his inner torment in sub-Terrence Malick monologues, interspersed with perfume-ad footage of Liv Tyler, who seems to have wandered straight off the set of Michael Bay’s Armageddon. While First Man was an object lesson in “show, don’t tell” film-making, Ad Astra seems determined to show and tell at every opportunity, right up to the hokey coda, which rivals the knot-tying antics of Insterstellar’s all-too-neat final act.None of which is to suggest that Ad Astra isn’t very entertaining hokum. While Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja’s Aniara more effectively evoked the existential horrors of being lost and alone in the universe, and Claire Denis’s High Life played the innerouter space riff with greater oddball conviction, neither of these superior films had the spectacular, crowd-pleasing appeal of Gray’s pulpy epic. In a world in which Star Wars movies still rule the roost, it’s encouraging to find an $80m space-based movie setting its artistic sights on the stars rather than simply recycling intergalactic horse-opera cliches. Yet with its lunar pirates, interplanetary shootouts and preposterous space leaps, Ad Astra owes as much to the legacy of those old Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s as any George Lucas fantasy franchise.An atmospheric score by Max Richter (augmented by Lorne Balfe’s “additional music”) amplifies the air of intrigue, while Jones’s saddlebag face and uber-grouchy delivery offer an effective counterpoint to Pitt’s perennially wounded star-child pout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37816d4a19be7cb1f0f3a31292806e53c9995caa/0_217_7232_4341/master/7232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18dc6b42b78764424413717707999e0a","title":"keira knightley interview official secrets film","story":"In an exclusive interview, the actor talks about her new film Official Secrets, in which she plays Katharine Gun, the whistleblower who tried to stop the Iraq war• Read an interview with the real Katharine GunThe role of Katharine Gun in Official Secrets is played by Keira Knightley. Earlier this summer, a few weeks before her second child was born, Knightley, 34, sat down and talked exclusively to the Observer about why she took the part, and why she felt she believed that the film was coming out at a timely moment.Did you spend much time with Katharine to prepare for the part?Not a huge amount. I had lunch with her, and she came to the set once. I really liked her. Gavin Hood, the director, had said he didn’t want a characterisation of her. I mean, I don’t look anything like her. She has an interesting accent because she was brought up in Taiwan. I really wanted to do that, but Gavin wouldn’t let me. I’m not a journalist, of course, so this was the first time I had asked anyone any questions that they legally could not answer. What is amazing about Katharine is that her point of view is so utterly clear. As far as playing her, that point of view had to come across. This is a story told through her eyes.Was it a story you were aware of?No. It was only a week before the war started, wasn’t it? I guess the avalanche of the invasion itself overwhelmed it. I was about 18 at the time. I thought I was engaged. I really remember the run-up to that conflict, but I didn’t remember this.It’s extraordinary to think that it was 16 years ago. Did you join the anti-war march in London?I wasn’t on the big march I was on the one before that. When the big march happened, I was in America shooting Pirates of the Caribbean and feeling utterly stupid that I was in a pirate costume and all my mates were on an anti-war march. I remember sitting in the makeup bus and there being a conversation along the lines of “We are going into Iraq to pay them back for 911” and thinking “Hold on - I don’t think that was Iraq!” For my generation it was the first time that we had been really politically engaged - and it didn’t change anything. There was disillusionment after that. Quite severe. The way that we viewed politicians and the world was massively coloured by the weeks leading up to that conflict.And led to where we are now? Katharine has that great line in the film, which was cheered at Sundance: “Just because you are prime minister that doesn’t mean that you’re allowed to make things up.”Look where we are now. The questions we have about government and accountability go back to that. Why are politicians who lie not held to account? The script made me think hard about that.The movie is very faithful to the story – which means that it doesn’t have a Hollywood ending…It’s a very British story in that way. It has that heroic failure about it. But what are you going to do? Write an ending in which the war didn’t happen? She didn’t stop it. She told the truth and there was little consequence.Films are a good way of opening up those historical questions. Are you offered more parts with a political edge than you were 15 years ago?Yeah, definitely. I’ve always loved a political thriller. I know some people like escapism, and that’s fine, but I like to be challenged. I was watching Paths of Glory last night, the Kubrick film, 1957, black and white, Kirk Douglas, about the futility of war, and political lies, and it’s amazing.Do you have any qualms about putting your head above the parapet, as it were, and talking about political issues?One thing I learned from being in the public eye when I was very young is this: you can say nothing and some people will hate you, and you can say something and some people will hate you. So you might as well, if you are feeling like it, say something. If I am asked my opinion, I generally don’t have a problem giving it.You don’t do any social media…I had an account for about five seconds. I watched it accumulate, like, 100 followers in three seconds and I got so freaked out that I turned it off straight away. . And then Facebook. I was on for a day 10 years ago, and never posted anything on it, but it still emails me all the time as if I am a member or whatever.That has obviously been a conscious decision…It has. I mean, the thing is, I don’t have very much that I want to share in that way. I have a child and another one on the way, and I want their privacy to be safe and sacred until they are old enough to choose what they want to do with their lives. I don’t write about family life – though of course I did write a very long essay about my vagina splitting! I am better at that kind of thing. Also I am rubbish at taking pictures, so my Instagram feed or whatever would be an embarrassment.Where do you go for news?I get my news from the  and the New York Times and the Financial Times at the weekend. I feel I should be branching out more, because I am reading papers that I generally agree with. My husband has - really kindly! - forced me into reading all of the climate change books that he has been reading. Which is just great when you are pregnant. I am halfway through Uninhabitable Earth. I have to do the Naomi Klein next. I spend half my time saying sorry to my baby in there. Maybe I should start reading all those rightwing newspapers and then I could pretend everything will be fine…The film centres on the courage of Katharine Gun in telling the truth. Can you imagine doing that yourself in that situation?Honestly, I have no idea whether I would – and I think that is what I find fascinating about it. It’s funny we all like to think we are truth-tellers. But we also know what the consequences are for truth-tellers like Katharine. Pretty horrific. What is interesting, culturally, I think, is that America has had relatively more whistleblowers than Britain. I think that generally speaking we do what we are told, and we toe the line. I have no idea why that is. Would I do it? I don’t know. I have no idea. I think it might even depend on how I was feeling that day.Official Secrets is released on 18 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4e1480de9f1147a6e23af30ef991b87b243a28/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2138f479c2b4c1d3e74c9cdb3df5df14","title":"chelsea v liverpool premier league live","story":"N’Golo Kante plays for the first time in over a month, while Mason Mount is fit to start after suffering an ankle injury against Valencia.Hello. The thing Liverpool really, really want is Manchester City’s title. But it wouldn’t hurt to take their record along the way. Liverpool have won their last 14 Premier League games, and need five more victories to beat the Premier League record set by City in 2017-18.A win at Stamford Bridge would be a particularly big statement of intent to win the title for the first time since 1990. If anything cost Liverpool the league last season, it was their away form against the big teams – they drew at Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Everton, and were beaten at Manchester City. Not exactly ‘Klopp out!’ stuff, but it’s the closest Liverpool have had to a weakness since they went to the next level with the signing of Virgil van Dijk at the start of 2018.Chelsea have had a mixed start to the season, with some uplifting football – especially away from home – and some shambolic defending. While they are a medium-term project for Frank Lampard, Liverpool’s time is now.This is the start of an important period for Liverpool. Their next seven fixtures include games against Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester United and Spurs, culminating in the huge one against Manchester City at Anfield on 10 November.

The final roll of the dice.77 min: Cresswell takes it – and it is a thumping effort – but it is always rising. Now, can Manchester United assert themselves on this game? They cannot play much worse.76 min: Fred’s first notable contribution? To foul fellow substitute Jack Wilshere, 25 yards from goal. A clumsy challenge by the Brazilian, who got the wrong side of the midfielder, who did well, driving forward, clinging hold of the ball. Yarmolenko, the goalscorer, and Aaron Cresswell both fancy it ...74 min: Mark Noble is booked for a late lunge on Wan-Bissaka. Anthony Taylor is quick to award a yellow card and the video assistant referee does check it – it was a meaty challenge – but there’s nothing doing. Taylor waves play on. “Yet again Mark Noble escapes a straight red v United,” emails Duncan. “What’s he got to do to be sent off?” It was a very poor challenge, that’s for sure. 72 min: The Manchester United bench is, it is fair to say, decidedly light on quality. When Fred, who made his first start of the season against Astana, is the saviour, it says a lot about the problems. “I think the telling thing about the 11 Man United players on the field is that, of the 20 outfield players on the field, I think the top five players are West Ham players,” emails Joseph Harvey. “The top two or three aren’t even close, honestly.” The best player on the pitch at the London Stadium this afternoon? Andriy Yarmolenko, perhaps? Felipe Anderson was very good without doing anything extraordinary.68 min: Huge chance goes begging for Maguire – but that is a massive save by Fabianski! Harry Maguire recycles the debris of an Ashley Young corner, having nodded a header into McTominay’s path. The United midfielder holds off Diop to stab it back into Maguire, who hammers an effort at goal but Fabianski gets down low to prevent Manchester United from finding an equaliser.65 min: “Man United are lacking strikers, why did they leave Greenwood out of the squad?” emails Lukudu Alison. A gentle reminder that the 17-year-old apparently has a bout of tonsillitis, hence his absence at the London Stadium, four days after scoring the winner for Manchester United against Astana.63 min: Up in the director’s box, Ed Woodward, sat in front of Lee Grant and Phil Jones, looks a combination of exasperated and hacked off as another Manchester United move breaks down, with James sending a cross crashing out of play.62 min: De Gea saves from Felipe Anderson! A close shave for Manchester United, who allow Yarmolenko to slide in the Brazilian. Anderson winds up a powerful shot from the angle and De Gea keeps it out with his legs. Smart stop.61 min: Lingard replaces Rashford. The Manchester United injury list mounts, with Rashford joining the sidelined Pogba, Martial, Greenwood, Shaw and Bailly.58 min: Marcus Rashford is down and requires attention. Rashford pulled up with no one around him and he’s shaking his head. That says it all. Jesse Lingard is being readied down on the Manchester United bench. Rashford looks upset, very distressed. That injury compounds things for Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who wraps his arm around Rashford, as the striker trudges off down the tunnel.57 min: Scott McTominay – just about – manages to get a shot away! But it is from an acute angle and no problem for Lukasz Fabianski to collect. It was a well-worked move, with Pereira sliding a neat reverse ball in for the midfielder, who jinked his way through to the byline but getting any kind of power on the strike was always going to be a tall order. Down on the touchline, Ole Gunnar Solskjær is barking away about something. That was a half-decent move.55 min: Felipe Anderson comes alive down the left wing – but Wan-Bissaka is alert to it and goes to ground – of course he does – to intervene. West Ham almost prosper from the resulting corner, with Anderson rolling the ball into Cresswell but Rashford steals the ball away. 51 min: It is bucketing it down at the London Stadium, where Ogbonna is back on after taking a knock from a collision with Dan James a moment ago. From the resulting throw-in, James dinks an inviting – but fairly flat – ball into the box but Fabianski comfortably gathers. Manchester United’s intentions this second half have eclipsed anything they mustered up in a dreadful first. 48 min: Mata! Just wide! Pereira zooms down the fight flank and powers a cross across goal but the Spaniard cannot ert it goalwards at the back post. It was not for the want of trying. McTominay did well to skip past Cresswell, to lay the ball on for Pereira out wide but his cross has too much weight on it for Mata to steer it in with his left foot. A frustrating afternoon continues.47 min: Rashford leads from the front and Daniel James almost wriggles his way through Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna but West Ham survive. Yarmolenko puts a foot on it to calm things down before Declan Rice is caught by Juan Mata, who has had what they call a stinker. Mata is booked for his efforts.46 min: West Ham get the second half started. No changes.So, Roy Keane is close to imploding at Mark Noble being allowed nine touches in the buildup to that fine Andriy Yarmolenko strike, his second of the season. Asked what was missing from that first-half Manchester United display José Mourinho replies, deadpan: “In this moment, I think they are missing everything. It looks to me a sad game, it looks to me a game of ‘Let’s see what is going to happen.’ Sometimes players are a bit confused and it’s difficult for them to understand.” Work to do for Ole Gunnar Solskjær.Roy Keane is about to crucify Manchester United. Stay tuned.It had been coming. Noble and Felipe Anderson are involved in the buildup and then the latter, first time, coolly rolls the ball into the path of Yarmolenko, who wraps his left foot around the ball and arrows it into the far corner beyond David de Gea. It’s this game’s first moment of real quality. Manchester United’s defending was slack at best, drifting around the box, chasing shadows before Yarmolenko hammered in. Ashley Young, in fairness, had flung himself in front of a couple of crosses from the right moments earlier but few of his team-mates followed suit.41 min: And now Ashley Young keeps an overlapping Ryan Fredericks at bay. Manchester United have been really poor.39 min: Dan James does brilliantly to sniff out the danger, as Felipe Anderson laid the ball on for Mark Noble. Just as Noble was about to take aim, James nipped in to take the ball off his feet and the former ends up chopping down the winger inside the United box. United were lethargic there, as West Ham patiently shifted the ball around the 18-yard area in search of the perfect opening.37 min: Right on cue, Rashford races to try and charge down a long Fabianski kick upfield, which Haller rises highest for. Victor Lindelöf is lured in to try and win it and concedes a foul. West Ham will try to build on a decent period of pressure.36 min: Rashford seems to be blowing. He’s been a peripheral figure so far and, more than anything, the United striker simply looks a bit knackered.34 min: Wan-Bissaka makes a wholehearted challenge on Pablo Fornals. It was a no-nonsense – and much-needed – tackle by the full-back. But the visitors are back under the cosh as West Ham win a free-kick, with Mark Noble teed up on the edge of the box. He stabs a volley at goal but it does not have anywhere near the kind of venom needed to trouble David de Gea. Still, it’s a shot on target.32 min: Pereira smacks the ball at goal and Manchester United do at least win a corner, with a hopeful strike deflecting out of play. It comes to nothing but it was an encouraging passage of play, which stemmed from Maguire and Victor Lindelöf in defence before Pereira took over the baton on halfway. United have struggled to maintain any sort of tempo but they came alive momentarily.28 min: It evades everyone and thuds out of play for a West Ham goal-kick. Young slaps his thighs in frustration, adamant his team-mates could have made a bigger attempt to reach his cross.27 min: Diop is penalised for a clumsy foul on Dan James. The winger’s pace is an out ball Manchester United are yet to truly make the most of. Young will swing it in from the left with his right foot, 40-odd yards from goal ...25 min: Yarmolenko turns Matic at the byline before a hammering a low ball across goal. United hack it away, as Wan-Bissaka makes a mess of a headed clearance. Back come West Ham, with Ashley Young eventually getting rid. 23 min: Scott McTominay thumps a cross across goal – that one is way too heavy for Rashford or anyone else to get on the end of. This is probably Manchester United’s best spell of the game so far, though. Meanwhile, Wan-Bissaka and Ashley Young have swapped flanks, with the former moving to left-back.20 min: Up the other end, Issa Diop heads clear a wonderful Wan-Bissaka cross. It was on a plate for Rashford, who had been played through on goal a few moments earlier before getting in a tangle. Rashford never really made a play to attack the cross and Diop had to intervene to avert the danger. He did well. As for Rashford, he does seem to be playing like a player a low on confidence.19 min: Yarmolenko curls an effort at goal – but it is relatively tame and David de Gea comfortably gathers. It stemmed from a high ball upfield to Haller, who got the better of Maguire. Fornals fed off the scraps and released Felipe Anderson out wide, who cut inside before unselfishly laying the ball off for Yarmolenko but the winger’s first-time effort lacked the conviction to beat De Gea.17 min: Mata dinks a ball in behind Fredericks and Dan James is off to chase. Great ball, good run ... and Manchester United have a corner.16 min: Cresswell zooms down the left but Aaron Wan-Bissaka is there every step of the way. Eventually, the Manchester United full-back goes to ground to halt the West Ham left-back. The hosts get the throw-in but then the offside flag goes up. Another move breaks down. That’s sloppy on their part.15 min: Nemanja Matic winds one up and powers an effort straight at Lukasz Fabianski from 25 yards out. Manchester United’s buildup play was a little bit slicker then but it has largely been pedestrian, other than Pereira racing down the right a moment ago. Rashford and James have been anonymous.13 min: After a long lull, Angelo Ogbonna commits to make a rash challenge on Pereira, who knocked the ball beyond the West Ham defender down the flank. Ogbonna goes into the book. He had little choice. West Ham had been knocking the ball about nicely but then cheaply surrendered possession and Ogbonna ed in to try and win it back to no avail. That’s about as exciting as things have got for Manchester United. They have been very flat.8 min: Aaron Cresswell does well to brush off Aaron Wan-Bissaka down the West Ham left, moments after being adjudged to have fouled Pereira, when it seemed as though the Manchester United midfielder went over rather easily. A tentative start by the visitors. West Ham are not bouncing up and down but will be relatively happy.7 min: Noble tussles with Matic on halfway but Anthony Taylor pulls up the West Ham captain for a foul. Ashley Young then slips in Marcus Rashford, who tries to race on to the ball at the byline. He gets there but is flagged offside. 5 min: West Ham win a corner after putting Maguire under pressure but Rashford heads away at the front post. That was easy peasy.4 min: Diop nicks the ball away from Mata and as West Ham fly forward, Haller again does superbly to come deep and spread play. Victor Lindelöf gets across to intervene, much to the delight of the away supporters.3 min: Hallers robs Matic 35 yards from goal and West Ham attempt to pick out Fredricks down the right but Noble overcooks his pass. Nice try. This is Manuel Pellegrini’s 50th game in charge of West Ham. How he’d love another victory over United.1 min: Fornals buys an early throw-in down the right flank. Yarmolenko tries to kickstart an attacking move but West Ham are happy to hold on to possession for the time being. Manchester United get things started at the London Stadium.The teams are in the tunnel! Here we go ...Grady Diangana watch, anyone? “For the Hammers wondering how Diangana is doing at West Brom, he’s only dominating,” emails J.R in Illinois, regarding the on-loan forward. “He just roasted Jonathan Hogg twice as he wriggled into the box and put the ball on a plate for Phillips to give the Baggies a 3-2 lead.” West Brom now lead 4-2 with seconds remaining at the Hawthorns. Successive defeats incoming for Danny Cowley and Huddersfield Town. A few murmurs that Mason Greenwood has a bout of tonsillitis, hence him not being involved in the 18-man squad at the London Stadium. It remains a very young Manchester United bench, including Axel Tuanzebe, Tahith Chong and Angel Gomes. The big plus for United, who have drawn their past three away matches, given Daniel James’s early-season form is that the Wales winger has recovered from a back problem. Manuel Pellegrini said Lanzini has a “small problem” but it is sufficient for him to miss out, with Pablo Fornals, a £24m signing, getting the nod for his second league start.Solskjær says Paul Pogba is going nowhere in January:Team news news: No Paul Pogba or Anthony Martial, as expected, for Manchester United, with the pair missing with ankle and thigh problems respectively, while Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly remain absent through injury. United are unchanged from victory over Leicester – they didn’t name a single unchanged side in the Premier League in 2018-19 – which means there is no place for 17-year-old Mason Greenwood, who struck the winner over Astana in midweek. Daniel James, however, is deemed fit enough to start after a late fitness test. As for West Ham, Manuel Pellegrini is forced into shuffling the pack, with Aaron Cresswell in for the suspended Arthur Masuaku, while Pablo Fornals replaces Manuel Lanzini."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f0026da4899b43f9ca8e377d3000bba4bd76fc/178_30_1349_810/master/1349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20bfa0956bcc0a9157412848642ee42f","title":"how to survive a twitter storm tanya gold fat shaming","story":"Tanya Gold published a piece about a plus-size mannequin one Sunday. By Monday morning the internet had gone mad and was out for her bloodIt was my fault. Sometimes I write glibly. I make an argument for myself and forget that people read it. It still surprises me, after 20 years of writing, to think that I have readers: that my internal monologue is out and about in the world. I do not think about them. If I did, I couldn’t write anything.In June, I wrote a piece about Nike’s obese mannequin, which was displayed at the London flagship shop to publicise Nike’s new willingness to sell clothes to overweight women. It makes me laugh now to think I insulted a mannequin – how, on that day in 2019, we came to discuss human rights for mannequins. I said it was a cynical doll from a cynical company that is no friend to women. I said that the normalisation of obesity frightens me, because I can see the outcome of addiction to sugar in myself. I said that the “fat acceptance” movement is an abyss of denial. I said the mannequin was “gargantuan” and “heaving with fat”. I said it might get diabetes – if it had flesh. I said that if it ran, it would ruin its inhuman knees.I am an addict: to alcohol, to nicotine, to sugar. And now I think that, because of this, I wrote about the doll with self-hatred. I was ill with alcoholism when I was young, and the worst thing was my denial. I conquered alcohol by hating what it made me with such ferocity I was too scared to drink again. But I never got anywhere with food. I am stuck on food. So I said I hated the doll.The piece appeared on Sunday. By Monday morning it was trending on Twitter. A friend emailed to tell me this, as if it were happy news: but she is a comic with the all the oddness peculiar to the comic. I do not write for attention, which is what I was accused of. I think it is more accurate to say that I write to conceal myself – and this time I failed.It rolled around the world. It followed the sun. I was called fat-phobic in the South China Morning Post and elitist in the . I became a person who hated women. My Wikipedia entry was changed to “Tanya Gold is fat and fat-phobic.” Within half a day I was an invented person, and that version of me, which I do not recognise, is more vivid than I am and will, I marvel, outlive any other version, no matter my future strivings. This invented person was fleshed out swiftly, like a doll, and this seemed, in retrospect, a suitable punishment. I was presumed to have opinions I have never held. A reply to a famous critic enclosed a list of inspirational mantras to protect against feminine self-hatred. I was presumed to be against all of them. If I wasn’t, I would not make sense.If I am being honest, I should say that I do recognise the character that was made for me, as a new skin. It is the voice of my own addiction screaming at me, as it often does, but now with many voices. In that sense it is the worst thing I can imagine. I had been found out. I began to hate my own name.My storm, though, was comparatively minor. I read Jon Ronson’s work about internet-shaming for context and comfort. In 2013, a PR called Justine Sacco wrote from Heathrow as she prepared to board a plane to South Africa: “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get Aids. Just Kidding. I’m white!” It was a bad joke. She later said she intended to “mimic and mock what an actual racist, ignorant person would say of South Africa”. It didn’t matter. By the time she landed she was the number one trend on Twitter globally there was an awful hashtag called #HasJustineLandedYet, designed to celebrate the annihilation of her name. She became a comforting scapegoat for every racist and she was punished. She lost her job and, according to Ronson, she was devastated by it. And another example: in 2012, Lindsey Stone was photographed at the Arlington National Cemetery’s Tomb of the Unknowns, pretending to scream and “flip the bird” by the “Silence and Respect” sign. She was fired a scapegoat for everyone who has ever been insensitive.A famous Twitter storm shows how swiftly it can turn. In 2013, at a tech convention, a woman overheard a man making a bad joke about “a fictitious piece of hardware that has a really big dongle, a ridiculous dongle… It wasn’t even conversation-level volume”. The woman tweeted: “Not cool. Jokes about… ‘big’ dongles right behind me.” The man became a scapegoat for every misogynist in tech he has three children and he lost his job. When hackers attacked her employer’s website, the woman was fired, too. Ronson believes that, at their heart, Twitter storms signify a desire for acceptance. If Sacco is entirely bad, then, by condemning her, others are entirely good. It makes the tweeting people seem vulnerable, and that is comforting.Because Twitter is monomaniacal, almost no one defended me. Those who did – on the danger of obesity point, which flew away – received the same punishment. So what follows should not have surprised me. There is another Tanya Gold. She is an editor, and kindly she sometimes forwards messages that have come to her in error, with wry comments. I wrote to her as it began: I’m sorry for what is coming. She replied: OK. She posted a note saying she was not the Tanya Gold who wrote the article. One of her friends wrote a hashtag #NotTHATTanya. They condoled with her for the hate mail. I was baffled that she was allowed an emotional response to the hate mail, which was mine, but I was not. Still, it was funny, in retrospect, watching people who had tweeted at her, returning in the spirit of maiden aunts once they learned their error. They were sodden with manners. One even offered her work. I couldn’t laugh at the time. I felt that the central narrative of my addiction – that I am two people, and one is good, and one is bad – had literally come to pass. Still, I was infamous.I turned on Radio 4 and they were talking about me. Piers Morgan asked me to come on Good Morning Britain, so he could teach me to be a good feminist, and I wept.In truth, I did not need my old name any more, because I had a new one: “Here’s a daily reminder,” wrote one Twitter correspondent, “that you: you’re a fucking cunt!!” They wrote satirically, misogynists day-dreaming of sexual violence: “Fuck you, Tanya Gold. Eat a dick.” Some people – women mostly – wrote to say they wanted to sit on my face.My subversion enabled all other subversion. A woman with the Twitter name Miss Lucy P changed her Twitter name to Tanya Gold’s Husband (Who is Fat). Someone wrote: “I HOPE YOU DIE OF HEART DISEASE! YOU FUCKING OBESE WHORE!!! DIE ALREADY!!! KILL YOUR FUCKING SELF!!! OBESE WHORE!!!” This person is apparently a personal trainer. I replied, idly: “Would you look after my son?” “Bring your son to your grave,” he replied. “Would it,” a woman asked, “be horrible if I had a wish that Tanya Gold’s body turned up in a ditch somewhere?” She is apparently a watercolourist.They seemed fascinated that I am fat and unearthed photographs to prove it, including many zoomed in on my crotch. It does make sense. If I am a “fat cunt”, I must have a byline picture.“I know how awful it is,” a journalist wrote to me, “but they do go away. Twitter storms are like real storms. The bigger they are, the better the weather is afterwards.” I recovered by searching for reality. I had become unreal, so I made something real. I wrote to a correspondent who had said: “Can’t you understand that the language you used suggests a disgust of fat people? If you cared about the health of these women you might have used more clinical language with statistics rather than the hyperbolic language you used.”I replied that I thought my language was too vicious. She thanked me for listening. I said I was addicted to sugar. She said she had a serious condition that was not related to obesity, but that the doctors had almost missed because she is obese. And that was the ending: a conversation from which we both learned something and from which we parted courteously. Once I had reclaimed myself from my avatar I was no longer hateful, at least to myself.

We want to support these choices,” said Vanessa Gouws, head of commercial services. “Our ambition is for the university to be carbon neutral by 2025.”Others, such as Leeds, are making plant-based food options available at all of their refectory counters for the first time.Tony Williams, a 27-year-old campus rep for the animal rights organisation Peta at Sheffield university, said many of the students he meets are interested in trying vegan food: “I think, because you’re in that learning environment already, you are more open and curious.”He works part-time in the university’s vegetarian cafe while studying for his degree in law and criminology. “I’ve seen first-hand just how many students are demanding vegan products. Just yesterday we sold out of vegan pies within the first hour of opening. And most university cafes, instead of just having one vegan option, will have three or four now.”To whet the appetites of the vegan-curious, the organisations that promote meat-free living will be giving out food to students over the next few weeks. The Vegetarian Society is planning to send thousands of vegetarian and vegan food parcels to universities for Freshers’ Week. Record numbers of campus reps appointed by Peta will be distributing free vegan milk, yoghurt, cheese and tofu “meat” to students. The number of these reps has more than tripled over the past two years, the organisation says.Last year, the most comprehensive study ever carried out on farming and climate change found that avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. “With growing concerns around animal rights and climate change, young people are really starting to act upon these issues,” said Dominika Piasecka, spokeswoman for The Vegan Society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b51c6e3af92837a50251deae6625022d55c3e62/0_180_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f32462a52fa48c8c227731d1c1caa9a1","title":"is big techs move to fund local news a cynical ploy","story":"Google and Facebook have stepped in to boost local journalism in the UK and US as they face political pressureAnyone who has passed through Cambridge recently (the one in the English countryside, not the one in Massachusetts),would have noticed that the ivory towers glint and sprawl with technological investment. “Silicon Fen”, as it is appropriately known, has been a key investment site for global technology companies wanting to tap into Cambridge University’s research capacities. Google is one such company, and now it has an added interest in East Anglia as it is partnering with local news company Archant to create three digital newsrooms in communities “currently underserved by news”.The venture, Project Neon, looks very much a carbon copy of Project Compass in the US, where Google is also partnering with a large local news chain, McClatchy, to set up digital outlets in news deserts.The first Project Compass experiment will be based in Youngstown Ohio, where the local newspaper, The Vindicator, printed its final edition on 31 August. It had succumbed to the pressures of falling revenues caused by a shift in newspaper reading habits and by the migration of advertising revenues to principally Google and Facebook.The Neon Compass projects are fascinating in that they represent the most direct intervention to date of any technology company in providing news.Both Google and Facebook are spending about $100m (£80m) a year each on journalism projects of a wide variety, but almost all of it is in grants or support to third parties.Stepping into the arena of building newsrooms alongside commercial news organisations – albeit to “experiment” with new models – brings with it obvious questions about potential conflict of interest, as well as the possibility that the two decades of failing to fix local news will soon be at an end.This type of investment raises the theoretical, but not impossible, scenario that Archant newsrooms will be simultaneously working with Google, and reporting on the activities and investments of the company in East Anglia. If Google continues its charitable support for news projects this will be a dilemma editors are likely to face with increasing regularity.As if to make the point, the outgoing Ofcom head, Sharon White, addressed the issue of tech company dominance in remarks made (coincidentally) in Cambridge at the Royal Television Society conference last week, where she expressed the personal view that online platforms needed to step up their side of the “social contract” and that one way or another contribute to the safeguarding of public service media, be it through payment or having public service content favoured by algorithms and promotional methods. In Washington DC last week the Washington Post unveiled an initiative that is meant to compete with the advertising power of Google and Facebook. Keen observers will have noticed that the Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, so there is at least room to interpret the launch of advertising platform, Zeus Prime, as being part of the growing influence of technology companies on news firms, rather than a bulwark against it.The Post’s Jarrod Dicker told me the news company already has tens of publishers waiting to join the platform, and that the potential exists for them to improve the advertising revenue they get from automated programmatic sales to increase by as much as five times.The Post’s heavy investment in software is unusual in the news business – most companies would struggle to employ 30 software engineers, let alone the 300 the Post has on its books. The hunt for a sustainable model for news in America stands in stark contrast to the government-led approach in the UK. Whilst initiatives such as the Cairncross review and the current Ofcom review of public broadcasting are busy carving out recommendations and institutional reforms, there is a notable and deliberate government policy void in the US.The constitutional separation of Congress from the free press is intentional and occasionally taken to the extreme, including spectating the near collapse of all local news holding companies and allowing a duopoly to dominate digital advertising.Stepping into the policy void in America are a mix of philanthropists, billionaires, foundations and, latterly, corporate sponsors, chiefly in the form of Google and Facebook both of whom have pledged to spend $100m each per year over the next three years on journalism initiatives.The growth of non-profit news in the US has been one of the brightest spots for the media in a somewhat bleak landscape. Newsrooms have launched at the rate of roughly one a month over the past 12 years. But the vast majority of these newsrooms are tiny. The total membership of the INN employs around 3,000 journalists and has revenues of about $450m. This puts the total non-profit news journalism head count at about double that of the New York Times, and total revenues at slightly less than a quarter.The big five technology companies – Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon – spent a combined $64m on lobbyists in Washington alone last year.In the coming year there are already signs it will be much tougher (were that possible) for the news industry. The New York Times closed its Spanish-language edition last week, and there are murmurs again of digital startup news organisations still struggling to make a profit. Bad news inevitably arrives in the autumn, as fourth quarter budgets and forecasting for 2020 make it clear to what extent businesses are sustainable.It is heartening to see that there is a great deal of policy energy and both corporate and civic concern for what comes next in news. It is also important to keep an eye on the jousting between the privately-funded initiatives, such as Project Neon, and the public policy developments such as Ofcom’s forthcoming report on public service broadcasting. Call me a cynic but the two might just be related. Is it a coincidence that we are seeing an influx of cash into experiments to aid journalism at a time when there is pressure on the big tech companies in Europe, the UK and, should there be a change of administration in the US in 2020 perhaps there too. Democrat candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have both been clear they see a need to curtail their power, and the latter has laid out plans to tax them to fund non-corporate media.Both in the market and in policy, 2020 looks like being a critical year in deciding how our future media landscape might look.

At last year’s race, The Cliffsofmoher was euthanised on the track after fracturing his shoulder.The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses had run a social media campaign to ask Swift to say #NupToTheCup.“Taylor Swift has put money before compassion by agreeing to perform at the 2019 Melbourne Cup,” the group posted online after the announcement Swift would appear.“Horses are being killed for gambling profits and entertainment. If Taylor Swift cares at all about other animals the way she appears to care about cats, she will cancel her show and make a strong statement that animal abuse is unacceptable.”Following Swift’s about-turn, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses spokeswoman Kristin Leigh said: “The pressure on Taylor Swift to cancel her performance was significant. Her fans did not want to see her supporting animal abuse.“Whilst the reason being used by the racing industry is a scheduling mix up, it appears to us that she has responded to those calls.“Taylor would certainly be much more aware of the cruel reality of horse racing than she was a few weeks ago.”Emily Rice from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said she “couldn’t be happier” about the pop star’s backflip. “The event is riddled with horse breakdowns and death and is linked to the bloody horse-slaughter industry,” she said. “None of this cruelty is consistent with the kind person we know Taylor to be.”The Victoria Racing Club said it was offering refunds to people who purchased cup tickets after Swift’s performance was announced on 12 September.The club said it would make an announcement about pre-Cup entertainment shortly. But animal activists said any replacement artists could expect the same backlash.“We will be keeping a close eye out for whether another artist is announced to perform at the day, which is widely becoming known as a national disgrace,” Leigh said.Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

I left with no GCSEs above a D,” says Angela Rayner, with a school rebel kind of a grin, as we start our interview. Brought up on a Stockport housing estate by her mother, who could neither read nor write, Rayner was pregnant when she quit full-time education. “I kind of left at 15.”She is now 39 and as shadow education secretary could soon be in a Labour cabinet. After a 45-minute discussion in which we cover education policy, inequality, Brexit, the state of the Labour party and Boris Johnson at breakneck speed it seems natural to wind up by asking what ambitions she could possibly have left. Would she like to complete her extraordinary journey by, one day, becoming Labour leader?She is prepared for the question and has her politician’s answers ready. “I am quite happy with the one we’ve got,” is the first reply. But when pressed about what might come to pass in a post-Jeremy Corbyn era, she accepts, based no doubt on personal experience, that anything must be possible. “Never say never,” she says with a big wink.For now, Rayner is focused on trying to reshape the education system so people from working-class backgrounds like hers can scale the heights. Paradoxically she shines out as an embodiment of social mobility in a system she believes is designed to choke it off. Modestly she puts her own ascent down to good fortune. “I don’t want to be the lucky one that was plucked from my background to get here,” she says.“I actually want it to be fundamentally part of what we do, making sure there is justice across the board so that the opportunities I have are available to all my friends, and not just for the lucky one to get that advancement.”Her approach to education policy is driven by frustration that the school system abandons so many young people. “I am not OK with the system that allows certain people to fail or be chucked out. I don’t accept that.”She quickly reveals a big reform plan to be announced at the Labour conference, which begins in Brighton this weekend, that she believes will help address some of the unfairnesses that rankle with her. A Labour government with her as education secretary would, she says, abolish the schools inspectorate Ofsted because in her view it creates more inequality and makes the lives of many teachers a misery. “I believe Ofsted measures poverty,” she says. “It measures deprivation. It doesn’t measure excellence.”There are too many cases, she believes, where Ofsted’s judgments reflect the affluence of a school’s intake and the social class of its pupils rather than the performance of the school. In her view, it encourages competition of the worst sort which in turn creates such high workloads and stress among teachers that many decide to leave for other jobs. “The whole system at the moment is a hothouse to pitch school against school.”So under Labour all schools and education providers would be subject to regular “health checks” led by local government. Inspectors would then follow up on concerns raised by the checks, and by parents, teachers and governors. “This means that in-depth inspections will arise from a genuine need, instead of taking place at random,” she says.It is a radical move, and follows previous commitments she has made to halt the expansion of academies and scrap free schools. Too many of the latter have been set up, she says, in middle-class areas where they are not really needed – with the result that resources have been erted from those in greatest need.There are limits beyond which she will not go, however, at least not yet. Rayner is no firebrand leftwinger, not even a dyed-in-the-wool Corbynista. She got into trouble with many on the left this year for daring to praise Tony Blair after he gave an interview about a second referendum. Some believe she occupies an interesting space somewhere between Corbyn’s Labour and Blair’s New Labour.This week in Brighton delegates are expected to discuss a motion to “Abolish Eton” from the campaign group Labour Against Private Schools, which calls for the removal of independent schools’ charitable status and would force them to let state schools use their assets. While the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has backed the motion, Rayner is more cautious, saying it is up to conference and the party to debate it. She is clearly in favour of ending charitable status if at all possible.“Private schools are gaming the system,” she says. “There is way too much state money going in, and people who go to private schools seem to be given a head start for all of the top jobs and that’s something that needs to be dealt with as well.” But if more draconian measures are in the pipeline she is not ready to reveal them now. Beforehand there is much serious debate to be had.On Brexit, she denies the party’s position is “fudged” – but readily admits it is has been difficult to reach a position around which the party can unite. Like the Labour leadership she prefers to talk about anything but Brexit. She seems genuinely enthused, however, about the prospect of a general election in which she wants fairness to be Labour’s guiding light. Intriguingly she suggests opportunity for all was what guided New Labour when she was growing up and helped her get to where she is today.“I think that most people when they are faced with more austerity, more cuts, a more unequal society or one that’s genuinely full of working-class people like me want to make sure that their kids get the opportunities that the last Labour government gave me. I think we will win hands down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf9d478009e6782f9bae57fe5c0ef3fa9c4522/293_404_6427_3856/master/6427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12e1e99d6f398885af24f615342dc00","title":"jeremy corbyn uk better off brexit deal right","story":"Labour leader risks infuriating activists and MPs as he plays down splits at party conferenceJeremy Corbyn has suggested a Labour Brexit deal could be preferable to remaining in the EU, putting himself on a collision course with activists and MPs pushing for the party to campaign for remain.In an appearance on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show before a contentious debate on Brexit at the party’s conference in Brighton, Corbyn sought to play down Labour isions after an aborted attempt to ditch Tom Watson’s job and the resignation of a key policy aide, Andrew Fisher.When asked whether it was in Britain’s long-term interests to remain in the EU, the Labour leader said: “It depends on the agreement you have with the European Union outside.”His suggestion that a Labour government could negotiate an exit deal that would be preferable to EU membership – and that he will reserve judgment until those negotiations are complete – will infuriate anti-Brexit activists.He said: “We have consistently put forward what I believe to be a credible option, which is based on five pillars – the customs union, the trade relationship, protection of consumer and environmental rights, and of course the Good Friday agreement.”If the EU27 agree to those demands, he said, “that would be a credible offer to put before the British people”.More than 90 local constituency Labour parties (CLPs) have submitted motions on Brexit to the conference, most demanding their party support remain. These are due to be hammered out into a “composite” at a late-night meeting on Sunday.But the national executive committee (NEC) is threatening to pre-empt those discussions by tabling its own policy statement – a draft version of which suggests deferring the decision on whether to support remain until a special conference to be held after a Labour government has negotiated a Brexit deal.Corbyn made clear that was his position. “We would put both views and say look, this is the best deal we could get this is the remain and hopefully reform option. These are the choices before you.”He added: “The vast majority of Labour party supporters and members supported remain, but a significant minority voted the other way. The party, the people and the leader of this country should understand why people voted leave.”Corbyn admitted he knew plans to ditch the role of deputy leader were under discussion, though insisted he was unaware that the “particular motion” would be launched on Friday night.“I was not aware that the particular motion was going to be moved at that time but I knew they would be discussing options, so when I heard of this I then proposed a statement to the NEC which I put myself, which was that we should have a consultation about having two deputy leaders in the future, which would reflect gender and ethnic balance in our society.”The attempt to abolish Watson’s post was launched by Jon Lansman, the founder of the pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum, and supported by 16 other members of the party’s NEC.Corbyn also confirmed that Fisher, his policy chief, was preparing to quit at the end of this year. Fisher sent a blistering memo, leaked to the Sunday Times, citing a “blizzard of lies and excuses” and apparently claimed that the highest ranks of the party were engaged in “class war”.Corbyn said: “I’ve obviously seen the words that Andrew wrote, and I discussed them with him at some length, immediately.” He said Fisher would remain in post for the general election campaign. He added: “I think he said that because he was extremely distressed at that point about whatever was going on, discussions within the office, in that moment.”Fisher was a central figure in compiling the 2017 general election manifesto.  understands he has recently been warning the shadow cabinet that Labour’s position of trying to appeal to both leave and remain is beginning to damage the party’s electoral standing.“I’m taking the party into the general election to end austerity, to bring forward policies that bring about a better standard of living and better opportunities for people all across this country. I’m enjoying doing that,” Corbyn said – adding that “of course” he would serve a full term, if elected as prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27fbd546db6d1a88a4d079e4bb89c37a0c511f65/0_221_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a52ce026a703df3481f58b1371d4095","title":"labour conference latest news jeremy corbyn calls for party to have two deputy leaders live news","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including events from the Labour conference in BrightonIn her speech to the conference Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said Tory policies were to blame for rising crime. She said:There is no question that the cuts in police numbers have contributed to the rise in crime. But other contributors are the cuts to education, the increase in school exclusions, all the zero-hours contracts, all the homelessness and inequality. All the cuts in mental health services have also played their part.And these are all Tory policies. When they say they will lead the fight against crime – do not believe a word of it. They are the ones who have created the conditions for rising serious and violent crime. Senior police officers are increasingly going on record and saying that cuts to public services have created an environment where crime flourishes. Cuts have consequences. You cannot keep people safe on the cheap.And she ended by saying Jeremy Corbyn would lead a “great, reforming government”. She explained:We will welcome refugees, including child refugees.We will proudly uphold the torture ban and treat the victims of torture with humanity, not detentions and deportations.We will end indefinite immigration detention, and limit it to the 28 days MPs were originally promised.And we will close Yarl’s Wood and Brook House detention centres and review the entire detention estate.We will fund our police forces properly, and work to give our communities genuine security.We will hold public inquiries into historic injustices – into Orgreave, into blacklisting.We will release all papers relating to the Shrewsbury 24 trials and the 37 Cammell Laird shipyard workers.I owe everything in life to the Labour movement. There was a postwar generation of socialists who campaigned against colonialism. There was the NHS orange juice and cod-liver oil. There was my free university education. And above all the chance to serve as Britain’s first black woman MP.Speaking at a fringe meeting about how Labour can win back support in its heartlands, Jon Trickett – shadow Cabinet Office minister and MP for Hemsworth – said he was fed up with the argument that the people who voted for Brexit were from “backwards” communities in the north of England. He said:Here’s the point I want to make. Those held-back communities – the heartland communities – can be found in Hastings, they can be found in Hackney and they can be found in Hartlepool.A very senior member of the Labour party she said to me ‘well, no wonder they’re all coming down south, the young people, because you can’t be gay up north’. That was said by somebody whose name you will have mentioned several times in the past few weeks.Those people who are suggesting that the people who voted or Brexit did not know what they were voting for infantilises 17m people.In his speech to the conference this morning Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said a Labour government would halt hospital closures pending reviews looking at clinical evidence and social impact. He said:Local hospitals and health centres are part of the fabric of society. They are valued local employers. Often where our children are born, or where we finally say goodbye to our loved ones. Shut services down and something invaluable vanishes from a community. Of course, nothing stays the same, medicine advances, treatments evolve, new facilities are built. I think we all understand that. But we need more capacity not less. So I can tell you cuts and closures because of Boris Johnson’s austerity will be halted, suspended and decisions reviewed based on clinical evidence and social impact instead.This is from Kay Boycott, the chief executive of Asthma UK, welcoming Labour’s announcement today that it would end prescription charges in England.We have been campaigning hard for years to stop the unfair prescription charges for people with asthma that are putting them at risk of having a life-threatening asthma attack, so it is hugely heartening that our concerns have been heard and the Labour party has now committed to scrapping prescription charges for everyone in England.An estimated 1.3 million people with asthma have cut back on their medication because of the cost, which puts them at risk of a potentially life-threatening asthma attack. Hundreds of nurses have seen their patients have asthma attacks or need emergency treatment because they can’t afford to pay their prescriptions. This is unacceptable and unfair. No one should have to pay to breathe.Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, told a fringe meeting at lunchtime that he also wanted the party to adopt an unequivocal pro-remain stance. He told the New Statesman event:We are at a vital crossroads, neutrality is not an option. The party should be unequivocally pro-remain. All Labour MPs should be whipped to campaign for remain.For a more colourful insight into what Len McCluskey probably thinks about Labour remainers, it is worth reading The Fall and Rise of the British Left, a new book by Andrew Murray, the chief of staff at McCluskey’s Unite union, and a part-time adviser to Jeremy Corbyn. Murray writes:Brexit Derangement Syndrome, a fever which has long prostrated the Conservative party, now runs riot on the left and has the potential to destroy the broad-based alliance for progressive social change assembled under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of Labour. Were it to become a full-on ‘remain’ party, as many politicians and pundits want, setting aside the decision of the 2016 referendum, it would endanger decisive layers of time-honoured support now regarded as out of joint with the new enlightenment. It would be a Hilary Clinton strategy in short.There are plenty of other reasons why it’s worth reading Murray’s book. It doesn’t contain any Corbyn office gossip, but it is well-written, sometimes funny and probably the best guide currently available to the ideology at the heart of Corbynism.In his Sky News interview, the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, also denied being involved in the attempt on Friday night to get Labour’s national executive committee to abolish the post of deputy leader. As PoliticsHome reports, McCluskey said the claim that he was involved (he and Watson are bitter enemies now, having once been friends) was “fake news”.Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has also been calling for unity this morning. But, unlike his fellow union leader Dave Prentis, whose call for unity was broadly supportive of Tom Watson (see 12.58pm), McCluskey said that if members of the shadow cabinet like Watson were not willing to back Jeremy Corbyn’s line on Brexit, they should resign.Speaking on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, when asked if he had a message for senior Labour figures who were arguing that the party should commit to campaigning for remain in any second referendum on Brexit he replied:My message is to support the leader ... We must go into an election united. And when we have a policy on Brexit, and Jeremy Corbyn makes it clear that that is the policy, then that’s what leading members of the shadow cabinet should argue for. If they find that they can’t argue for it because they feel strongly, well of course they have that right, but they should step aside, and step aside from the shadow cabinet, which will become the cabinet, and they can argue whatever they want.Asked if that meant he was unhappy with people saying the party should commit now to backing remain in any future referendum, McCluskey said he was if these people were “in the leadership”. He explained:In this situation ... in order for Labour to get through the message of unity and healing our nation, everybody needs to be singing from the same hymn sheet. Now if the leadership team – the shadow cabinet, soon to be the cabinet – find that difficult then yes they should step aside.A reminder: among those people who have been saying today that Labour should commit now to backing remain in a second referendum come what may are: Tom Watson, the deputy leader (see 12.39pm), Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader (see 12.16pm), and Mark Drakeford, the Welsh Labour leader and Welsh first minister (see 11.47pm).The morning session in the conference hall has just ended. Delegates were supposed to have a series of votes – including on the private schools composite (see 11,26am) – but the votes had to be abandoned after a few minutes of chaos. The chair, Andi Fox, called a vote on a proposal to “reference back” part of the early years policy commission report. But two delegates used points of order to complain that they did not know exactly what bit they were referencing back, the chair was unable to explain, and after an outbreak of angry shouting from the hall she announced that all the votes would be put off until the afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident. Scotland are hard to predict. Wales have high hopes. And Uruguay just want to win a gameWe hope to win it, but is that realistic? We will be competitive and we will trouble top teams, may even upset one if it all comes magically together. We have a decent draw if we can beat Wales. If we top our pool, we play France or Argentina in the quarter-finals and will be too strong for them. That gives us a semi-final, most probably against South Africa or New Zealand, maybe Ireland, at which time our tournament will end. If we are very lucky and face Ireland – who are a much more settled team but have shown some weaknesses recently – we might make a final. But I very much doubt it.We have a decent pack and lineout, but our No 6 is not a No 6. Michael Cheika will unbalance the pack and play the Michael Hooper and David Pockock combo, which does not work. Our bench players does not give us depth. We have brought an out-of-form and ageing Ashley Cooper instead of some of our best performers. One full-back can’t catch high balls and the other has no pace. At least one winger has no pace.

Aiden Smith•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterThe “glory days” of the 1990s, when Canada could be competitive against all but the very big boys, are long gone and there is a widespread acceptance that the standard of rugby here has slipped and with it a huge opportunity has gone. Couple that with being placed in a “pool of death” and expectations among Canadian rugby fans are very low. The Namibia game represents our final. If we win that and put up a creditable performance against Italy, most fans will be satisfied. Tim YobiloEngland are not favourites but we are one of the main contenders. This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approaching the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

The strong-running Tuilagi crossed twice within eight minutes in the first half but England were made to work unexpectedly hard for a try bonus point.Fewer than four minutes remained when England finally scored their fourth try through Luke Cowan-Dickie after good work from fellow replacement Jonathan Joseph. Earlier this month New Zealand stuck 92 points on Tonga in a warm-up game but England’s initial effort was rather more notable for its staccato rhythm and frequent handling errors, with the notable exception of Tuilagi’s powerful contribution.It feels like half a lifetime since Tuilagi was being fished out of Auckland Harbour to put the ill-disciplined seal on England’s ill-fated 2011 campaign in New Zealand. More off-field misadventures and a catalogue of injuries meant this was his first World Cup game for eight years and his desire to make up for lost time was obvious.Basing definitive World Cup forecasts on the evidence of England’s collective early form, however, remains a notoriously inexact science. It is 28 years ago since they last lost their opening pool game and, with respect to Jonathan Webb and Rob Andrew who were their only points-scorers in a 18-12 defeat by New Zealand at Twickenham, that is slightly too long ago to have any great relevance.In the intervening period their tournament fortunes have been mixed and it will not be until the knockout stages commence next month that we shall really know how Eddie’s grand plan is coming together. What you can say is that when they run straight and hard, kick out of hand accurately and maintain their discipline they are a tough side to beat, regardless of the backdrop.The last part of that trifecta was conspicuously missing here as England leaked more penalties in the opening 20 minutes than New Zealand conceded in their entire game against South Africa on Saturday night. The sight of Jones bashing his desk in irritation after Kyle Sinckler had conceded a dumb penalty for obstruction (after Maro Itoje had gathered a totally innocuous restart) was all the confirmation anyone needed that the management had been hoping for slightly better.Some of the kicking was also mixed but, physicality wise, England are currently a reliable handful. Even Tonga, not exactly the frailest of opponents, struggled to contain the onrushing Tuilagi, whose fearsome strength after taking a short ball from Ben Youngs down the blindside from a scrum also seemed to prompt the television match official to cover his eyes. Despite no clear and obvious evidence the try was duly awarded, apparently on the old school basis that it looked as though it should have been one.His second try was rather more clear-cut, with England taking good, positive advantage of a hopeful kick aimed towards Anthony Watson. Although the Bath winger was collared the ball was swiftly recycled and the alert Elliot Daly released Jonny May into space on the left. May unselfishly found Tuilagi on his inside and Farrell’s conversion gave England a 15-3 cushion seven minutes before the interval.There could have been another English try before half-time only for Ben Youngs to be held up over the line having taken a quick tap. It mattered little in terms of the outcome with two further Farrell penalties and a line-out drive score for Jamie George stretching England’s advantage prior to Cowan-Dickie’s late score. Jones, however, will be looking for a distinctly sharper all-round performance in their next match against the United States in Kobe on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffe5db20fb202a04876d9cfce6a17a45bb373398/0_45_3051_1830/master/3051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dba0fb50d25c8b423b20d4fc1f49b0e","title":"rugby world cup ireland scotland match report","story":"The Scottish supporters who trudged out of the ground in the pouring rain wondering how an eagerly anticipated showdown against their Six Nations rivals turned into such a miserable letdown would not have been heartened to hear Gregor Townsend explain his players’ no-show in what, for many of them, should have been the biggest match of their careers.Lesson one in the manual on how to beat Ireland is to cherish the ball. Scotland must have downloaded the Japanese version as three mistakes in their opening 25 minutes when they were in possession were converted into tries by their opponents and a 16-point interval deficit. They came back from nearly double that against England at the end of this year’s Six Nations at Twickenham, but there was never the remotest prospect of a repeat here, with Ireland at their meanest throughout.“We did not start with the energy, accuracy or aggression required to beat Ireland,” said Townsend. When asked why, he had no explanation. A coach may have no control after his players have left the dressing room for the playing field, but Scotland started as if determined to live up to an ideal, paying little heed to the deteriorating conditions or the effectiveness of Ireland’s defenders in closing down the outside-half Finn Russell.There was a telling statistic on an evening that left Ireland in control of the group and on course for a quarter-final against South Africa. The possession was roughly shared, 51-49 in Ireland’s favour, but they kicked from hand more – 43 compared with 33 – and they made 92 passes, compared with Scotland’s 169. They played the conditions and their opponents – the reason they started the tournament at the head of the world rankings while Scotland were eighth.They were prompted by Conor Murray, who looked back to his sharpest after an injury-ravaged season. The manner in which he set up his side’s bonus-point try 15 minutes into the second-half defined the game: it was his maliciously weighted kick that Ryan Wilson spilled and when Jordan Larmour set up a ruck, Murray quickly spotted Andrew Conway had space on the right and passed to him with alacrity.Scotland had started as if trying to emulate New Zealand here less than 24 hours before, but when Duncan Taylor’s pass to Sean Maitland on halfway went straight into touch after three minutes, Murray launched an attack before Ian Henderson’s rampaging run took Ireland close to Scotland’s line. A few snipes later, James Ryan forced his way over and the game had not reached the 10-minute mark when Grant Gilchrist lost the ball just inside Ireland’s half and Larmour counterattacked.Ireland were awarded a penalty that they kicked to touch and Rory Best twisted his body under pressure from Wilson to somehow ground the ball. Scotland’s possession had yielded two tries to their opponents and although Greig Laidlaw stemmed the flow with a penalty, almost immediately Finn Russell failed to find Tommy Seymour breaking into the line on his inside. Conway hacked on and forced Stuart Hogg to concede a five-metre scrum after the ball bounced off a post.CJ Stander set off from the base and after Peter O’Mahony made another metre, Tadhg Furlong found a surprising gap between Jonny Gray and Stuart McInally to claim his side’s third try, all scored by front-five forwards. It was in effect the end of the match, and although Scotland tried to be more patient after the break and take play through phases, they lacked a ball-carrier in the mould of Stander or Henderson and still kept spilling passes.They lost their flanker Hamish Watson after 37 minutes when his right knee buckled as he was cleared out of a ruck by Ireland’s two props and left the field in a buggy. Townsend hoped Watson would be scanned that night but his tournament looked over. Scotland have Magnus Bradbury in Tokyo on stand-by. Ireland lost Bundee Aki and O’Mahony to head injuries in the opening 26 minutes. They both failed their assessments six days ahead of their side’s second match against Japan. Jonathan Sexton was taken off in the third quarter, when the game was won, but had not aggravated an old groin injury.Victory over Japan would all but guarantee Ireland finished at the top of the group with Samoa and Russia to come but Scotland face the prospect of having to defeat the hosts to make it to the last eight. Since their win against Ireland at Murrayfield in 1991, they have only once beaten a fellow tier-one nation in a group match: against Italy in 2007 – and then they needed their opponents to miss a late penalty.While they were not fancied to defeat Ireland, they were expected to make a game of it. Had they shown half as much zeal as the largely amateur Russia had against Japan on the opening night, it would have been something. “Disappointed,” said Townsend when asked how he felt. His side’s supporters preferred something stronger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/951718e33d817708e093179c5fe8b033938bca89/239_225_3103_1862/master/3103.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=714f1318ac41bc40e4470424b3c0f726","title":"england v tonga rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"Manu Tuilagi was back to his best, scoring two tries, in a solid but unspectacular victory for EnglandThat’s it from me, enjoy the rest of the week’s Rugby World Cup on the .

At the end of the day we got five points and that’s what we came for, I’m really happy we haven’t conceded a try”“Manu has power and pace and runs great lines, he’s going to have a great world cup.”So many location emails!Andy and Emma Newsham get in touch, “On the island of spinaloga off Crete on our honeymoon” Congratulations to you both. And who says romance is dead when you go on honeymoon to a former leper colony? “Hello from the beautiful Alhambra Palace in Granada.” says Michael Davis, “Parents pre-booked timed tickets so have the pleasure of keeping up with the rugby via the live blog” “It was a good start. Tonga are a tough team and we wanted to keep the ball away from them. We need to get the ball into our hands a bit earlier and look after it a bit better”It wasn’t exactly a spectacle, unless your idea of a spectacle is watching a YouTube video of a car rolling very slowly out of a parking space before coming to a halt after 1o metres, but it was what was required - a bonus point win, no tries conceded, and everyone remains fit. Not much from Tonga to suggest they will do much in this tough pool, but will reserve judgement until we have a look at the USA on Thursday. The ball is eventually worked left but the onrushing Itoje in the tackle line forces a knock-on that brings the game to a close.83 mins.  Tonga win the lineout and put some phases together for what feels like the first time in the match. England are woking very hard in defence to maintain Tonga’s try duck, but still the rumble forward a few inches at a time.80 mins.  England give away a penalty for collapsing at the Tonga scrum, Tonga are on the attack before Dan Cole gives away another one at the breakdown. Tonga send it to the corner.78 mins.  England are rampant now, attacking up the left at will through Daly and Joseph, the latest raid comes to a halt as Tonga knock on when trying to go for the ball. Kruis returns the favour by spilling a pass on the following attack.76 mins.  It’s all very loose with England getting a little frantic as they chase the bonus point try, but Joseph injects some class by gliding through some tired midfield tackling, drawing the fullback and calmly putting Cowan-Dickie away to score. Farrell does the extras.73 mins. Tonga make their last sub - Faleafa for Fifita - and he’s straight in to help win thei lineout just inside their own half. It’s kicked deep to Watson who goes on a magnificent run from his won 22 all the way to Tonga’s. What a run that is!The tackle is made and the ball is worked left to Slade who mangles the pass to Daly with the line at his mercy. They are both fuming with each other, but Daly overran that if you ask me.70 mins.  Farrell’s first act at 10 is to to fling a pass too hard to a Itoje in midfield and it pinballs off his hands and face for a knock-on.The Sapporo Dome sounds like a Buddhist monastery on a be more quiet Friday68 mins.  Tonga have a lineout in their own half which they win at the tail and get another rumble on before losing possession AGAIN, this time to Tom Curry and England are back on the attack in the Tongan half.Joseph is on for Ford, which will see Farrell move into out-half.England have carried the ball for 419 metres to Tonga’s 116, which pretty much tells the story of this match63 mins.  Tonga win the penalty at the scrum, and have a great lineout position on the England 5m, which they catch and drive. It looks to be getting going but Itoje is in there again, clamping on the ball like a mollusc. England scrum.61 mins. Slade is up and running again and he will now be back in position to defend a Tonga scrum on the England 10 metre line. Fisiihoi is off for Tonga in the front row, replaced by Maile.58 mins. England are attacking at will now, Slade joins the line and is into the Tonga 22 before being hauled down, Tonga win a penalty but miss touch with it and a some kicking ensues before England have a lineout just inside the opposition half. Vaipulu is off and is replaced by Nasi Manu. Fukofuka is on for TakaluaKyle Sinckler has made his exit for Dan Cole.As straightforward as they come, this. Catch and drive from the lineout rumbles forward and powders the helpless Tongan defence before George falls down at the tail to score. Farrell converts.That was George’s last action, he’s off and Cowan-Dickie is on.54 mins.  It takes a while to get the scrum going and in the end Takalua sends it to touch.Substitutions coming thick and fast. Ludlam for Underhill, Kruis for Lawes, Heinz for Youngs.51 mins. England are swarming over Takalua in coffin corner on the left after Ford’s clever kick through. They win the ball and it goes out to Underhill and first receiver who drops it.Slade is on for May, Daly has moved to wing and Slade is at fullback. Interesting.49 mins. Genge on for Marler, Fia on for Tameifuna.Morath is also down and needing a head injury assessment. Faiva replace him temporarily 48 mins. Bit of a kick-fest at for a few minutes before Tonga give away a penalty for holding on just inside the England half. Underhill was the man causing the nuisance.Tuitavake is on for Pakalani on the Tongan right wing. 45 mins. Tonga win a turnover in England’s half after England spill it, Morath looks for options and takes concludes that dinking to touch is the correct one, then his forwards give away a pen at the lineout. England are into the Tonga half but a bit of a mix up between Farrell and Tuilagi gives a scrum to Tonga.Tuilagi smashes it up and when he’s eventually hauled down the Tongan tacklers don’t roll away. It’s in front for forty metres and Farrell does the necessary.Owen Farrell goes deep into Tongan territory with his kick and the return from Tonga sets up an England lineout on halfway.“I’m actually in Japan but at a family event with no access to TV. So near and yet so far,” laments Adam Green, “and no matter how much of a dud the game is it seems weird not to be watching!” And this from James Padfield:“I sometimes feel like the only rugby fan in Sardinia! I’ve been caving this morning, and we exited the cave in time for me to listen to the game on the radio and follow it on the , while preparing lunch.” Now that’s livin’ alright, James. Winning this game was never in doubt, but England are doing nothing particularly well at the minute, which is irritating for those who want to see them show something to carry forward. It should and neeeds to get better in the second forty.If Tonga could kick better out of hand and not give up possession in broken play so easily, this game would be a lot closer. “Thanks for keeping us informed here in Sardinia” say Neil and Caroline. They even included a sunglasses emoji. Honestly you two, not seeing this cowpat of a game is quite the boon wherever you may be, but Sardinia is a very good place.Tonga catch the linout and look to drive it, but Itoje is in there with his hands on the ball and when it inevitably grinds to a halt the ref gives a scrum to England, and that brings a hideously dull half of rugby to an end.40 mins.  The gong has rung, but Tonga have a penalty to have have one last attack via a lineout on the England 22.39 mins. It’s shoulder contact with the neck, but he was set very low, he was trying to wrap the arms and Watson dropped into him. Ref says play on.38 mins. England are starting to put together some phases through the forwards as they begin to recycle more quickly. It looks promising around halfway before Watson is given a poor pass as Kalamafoni arrives to boom him. Watson spills the ball and Tonga have a scrum around halfway on the left. The referee, Paul Williams, wants to look at the tackle by Kalamafoni as it looked to hit Watson in the face. It’s an easy one for Farrell from right in front and he treats it accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eda96edbb00c5d0b6048aae78582c306f64a00d3/0_196_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86356ce13a2577e5d3429d2471573d94","title":"f1 singapore grand prix live","story":"Ferrari completed a one-two with Sebastian Vettel beating Charles Leclerc into second, with Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton not able to make the podiumDid not finish KimiRäikkönen, Alfa Romeo SergioPerez, Racing Point BWT George Russell, WilliamsBooming fireworks light up the night sky on the equator, as high-fives are slapped about the place among the Ferrari team. Whatever Leclerc may feel, he’s part of a team suddenly in chipper mood as their fine late-season form continues.Vettel speaks: “It feels sweet. Great race, big congratulations to the team. The start of the season was difficult for us but in recent weeks we’ve started to come alive. I’d like to thank the fans, the last couple of weeks have been not the best for me but it’s been incredible to get so many nice messages. It’s given me a lot of strength and belief.”Leclerc swallows his palpable unhappiness to say: “Obviously it’s always difficult to lose a win like that but at the end it’s a one-two for the team, all the guys deserved it, we arrived hoping for a podium, and got a one-two. For myself, I’m disappointed for my side, as it sometimes happens, but I’ll come back stronger.” He praises the new car “It looks positive, more than we expected, they’ve done an amazing job. The strategy was fixed at the beginning of the race, so I stick to the plan,” he adds, possibly pointedly.Verstappen, in third place, says: “The whole race went well, I’ve got to be happy. I started to struggle a bit with the tyres so we boxed but that was a good call because we undercut Lewis in the end. In general happy to be on the podium, it’s always difficiult to overtake here, so to do it by strategy is good. You’re working harder in a race like this than when you’re going flat out.”And now they’re on the podium for anthem time.“Awesome job, well done!” Vettel is told over the radio. It was a smart drive by the German, who became his team’s main man after the mid-race congestion and stops and starts. Leclerc may be aggrieved. Hamilton may only have come fourth, but his lead has been extended by one point, to 64. He’s still in a very healthy position, even if this really wasn’t Mercedes’ race.Lap 6161 It’s a one-two for Ferrari. And a third straight win for the team, though Leclerc will be disappointed he couldn’t make it a personal hat-trick. For Vettel, it brings to an end a grim winless run. Hamilton can’t quite get close enough in the key moments to Verstappen, who takes third. Bottas is fifth.Lap 6061 Verstappen is struggling with power but he does well to hold off Hamilton’s superior engine power. He’s showing all his champion’s competitive aggression here, but he’s still outside the top three. Vettel leads going into the final lap!Lap 5961 Hamilton closes on Verstappen – he’s no more than a car length and a half or so behind him now, but Vettel looks unassailable out front. His lead is now over two seconds.Lap 5861 Kvyatt sets a new fastest lap for the race of 1:44:47 for what it’s worth, though he remains back in 15th. Only for Hamilton to surpass it a few seconds later. Vettel still leads from Leclerc, Verstappen and Hamilton with three laps to go.Lap 5761 Given what an error-strewn season Vettel has endured, he’s driven with incident-free composure today, for all that Leclerc may gripe. The German leads by 1.9sec now. Hamilton still can’t quite get within range of Verstappen. Magnussen goes in for a tyre change to keep himself in the race.Lap 5661 Hamilton gets within DRS range of Verstappen but isn’t able to take him on yet, so the podium’s in view for the Red Bull man. Lap 5561 Time is running out for Leclerc to make his move on Vettel, whose 392-day winless run could be coming to an end. The lead is now 1.2sec as Vettel sets a new fastest lap for the raceLap 5461 In the mid-market points battle, Gasly is challenging seventh-placed Norris strongly at the moment, with Hulkenburg in ninth and Giovinazzi up into 10th.Lap 5361 Leclerc keeps Vettel within striking distance – it’s around a second at the moment – with Verstappen 2.4sec behind the leader in third, and Hamilton more than a second further back in fourth. His championship lead looks strong still, though it’s not really been his race today.Lap 5261 Racing resumes as the safety car comes in. Hulkenburg is reporting some car trouble, but is told to keep at it. The stewards will look at the Raikkonen-Kvyatt brouhaha after the race. Ricciardo goes past Magnussen into 13th. As you were at the front for now.Lap 5161 This is supremely frustrating, and makes it increasingly likely that this race will time out now, with around 17 minutes to go to the two-hour mark. What had seemed tactically intriguing and hard to call might be petering out into a less than thrilling finish. It’s Vettel 1, Leclerc 2, Verstappen 3, Hamilton 4 Bottas 5.Lap 5061 Kvyatt takes on Raikkonen, breaks and arrives late and forces the Finn right off the track. This means the safety car – again! Kvyatt survived the kerfuffle, and carried on racing, but having forced himself and Raikkonen off has lost some ground. Raikkonen’s quit.Lap 4961 A word for mid-race front runner Giovinazzi, who’s recovered some ground after dropping back. He’s 11th, and well placed to challenge for points. Vettel keeps his lead to between 0.9sec and 1.1sec on Leclerc, while Verstappen slightly extends his lead on Hamilton.Lap 4861 No constructor’s ever had a one-two finish in Singapore. Will we get one here? The safety car comes in and they get ready to fire up again. Vettel builds his lead, taking it to around 0.9sec. Mercedes restarted well, Verstappen trying to gain on Leclerc, whose chances are fading. Ricciardo’s pass on Kvyatt is the first movement as competition is renewed, but then he’s overhauled by three – Kvyatt, Grosjean and Sainz. Lap 4761 Charles Leclerc is told over the radio by his team that he needs to bring his car in for new tyres. “I won’t be stupid, I want to finish one-two but I just think this is not fair,” he says. We’re gonna have some talking points after this race. Hamilton almost runs into the back of Verstappen as they prepare for the safety car to come in, which it is due to, after this lap.Lap 4661 There are, in theory, 15 laps to go but such has been the pace – or lack of – in this race that we might hit the two-hour time limit a lap or two short.Lap 4561 Some cars drive around. A safety car in front of them. The less things change, the better this is likely to be for the Ferraris.Lap 4461 Back comes the safety car as Sergio Perez walks disconsolately away from his static car, to round off a miserable week. He’s been a touch poorly too. This isn’t going to help Mercedes, mitigating their tyre advantage.Lap 4361 Leclerc pushes hard on Vettel, within DRS range, but stays second for now, as Perez moves into the top 10 before hitting mechanical bother and grinding to a halt. There’s a fierce scrap for championship points going on in the middle, and some casualties.Lap 4261 So where do we stand with fewer than 20 laps left? It’s 1 Vettel by 0.7sec from 2 Leclerc 3 Verstappen 4 Hamilton 5 BottasLap 4161 No DRS for the first two laps after the safety car, but plenty of jostling as the Ferraris forge ahead in ominous style. Gasly and Stroll, I think, have had a coming-together further back. Ricciardo, who had to treat a puncture during the safety car period, moves up to 16th, while Hulkenburg moves in front of Stroll in 12th. Stroll now has a puncture having had clashes with first Gasly and now Raikkonen.Lap 4061 Freedom! The safety car period ends. All to play for in the last 20 laps.Lap 3861 Russell’s had to quit the race after that clash. “My head is down and it will be down until the race is ended” says Leclerc after being told to keep his bonce down and plough on. He doesn’t sound happy, and is displeased with the undercut from his teammate. He’s got a point, having been their man in pole.Lap 3761 Hulkenburg goes into the pits as the safety car stays out. As they ease round, a reminder of how they stand: 1 Vettel 2 Leclerc 3 Verstappen 4 Hamilton 5 Bottas 6 AlbonLap 3661 George Russell goes into the wall after a clash with Grossjean as Ferrari try to build a safety car lead. We could now have a safety car, and we do. It’s duly deployed. This means Hamilton will stay out if the Ferraris pit. Game on?Lap 3561 Giovinazzi pits at last, and he’ll have needed a tyre change anyway after that clash. As does Ricciardo, who also copped some damage in the incident. Vettel leads by just under five seconds from Leclerc. Hamilton reckons Ferrari are running a two-stop race, which gives the safety car some importance.Lap 3461 Bottas goes wide to pass Giovinazzi, who then clashes with Ricciardo as the latter overhauls him and forces him wide. He could have some damage here, and the Italian is dropping back alarmingly. That’s a real shame.Lap 3361 Ferrari looking promising now, as Leclerc squeezes past Giovinazzi to give them a one-two at the front. Which driver will the team prioritise from now? Hamilton passes Giovinazzi to move into fourth. He’s not out of this yet, but he is 3.9sec behind Vettel in first.Lap 3261 Leclerc overhauls Gasly on the corner with consummate skill and no real fuss or resistance. He’s now taking on Giovinazzi on second. Verstappen passes Gasly too. So it’s now 1 Vettel 2 Giovinazzi (yet to pit) 3 Leclerc 4 Verstappen 5 Gasly 6 Hamilton 7 Bottas 8 AlbonLap 3161 Vettel now leads! He makes quite an easy pass on Giovinazzi. Gasly is third, Leclerc fourth and Verstappen fifth, having just passed Ricciardo, who’s had a pretty decent race considering. Stroll goes into the pits.Lap 3061 Tyres are wearing easily in these conditions, which adds to the uncertainty as Vettel attacks Gasly and passes him – did he force him off the track there? – and now the Ferrari lead man is in second. But will he cop a warning?Lap 2961 Top fact, and possibly a damning one. Giovinazzi is the first person outside a Mercedes, Red Bull or Ferrari driver to lead a grand prix since Williams at Silverstone in 2015. Meanwhile, Vettel passes Stroll and Ricciardo to seize third place. Leclerc passes Stroll to move into fifth too. Hamilton is still eighth, behind Verstappen in seventh.Lap 2861 Leclerc tries to go past Stroll in fifth but can’t quite force the opening, and that’s good work from Stroll. Verstappen is looking to exploit such a battle a place further back. Giovinazzi still leads by 1.1sec from Gasly. It’s all about reading and managing the considerable traffic here.Lap 2761 So Giovinazzi now leads! Verstappen and Vettel try to close, having struggled to make ground, while Hamilton emerges from the pit lane in front of Bottas. He’s eighth, and net-fourth in the race. It’s not a big gap but a lot depends on how Giovanazzi, Gasly and Ricciardo set the pace out front, none of whom have pitted. This is properly intriguing. Hamilton is told “the race will all happen at the end”. It probably will.Lap 2661 Leclerc’s easy control of the early stages of the race has certainly gone though he’s still firmly in contention. Hamilton still leads from Giovinazzi. They’re standing by at Mercedes to pit Hamilton …Lap 2561 Bottas has just set a fastest lap, and he has a chance of having a net lead over Hamilton post-pitting. He’s currently ninth. In front of him Verstappen (8th), Leclerc (7th) and Vettel (6th), who could be the Ferrari driver most likely to at the moment.Lap 2461 Hamilton says his tyres “are not great but I don’t want you to stop me” at this point. He leads from Giovinazzi, Gasly and Ricciardo, none of whom have pitted.Lap 2361 Bottas goes into the pits but Hamilton stays out. Of the leaders who’ve pitted, Vettel is sixth, Leclerc seventh, Verstappen eighth and Bottas ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71dc82bfdb83b50155a1eaa107c0ab3c892de4c6/0_0_3125_1874/master/3125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da7c52dc2421dee0b7e3f7a86307e706","title":"bianca del rio review startlingly mean drag star comedian","story":"Wembley Arena, London Though the timing is spot-on, the comedian’s outrageous swipes at every sexuality, race and even disability descend to cliche as their wickedness exceeds their wit It’s a big night for Bianca del Rio, breakout star of RuPaul’s Drag Race and the first draq queen to headline Wembley Arena. And she’s celebrating the occasion by being unspeakably vicious about everybody. Of course, Del Rio isn’t the first drag act to flout propriety. But Bianca really puts the outré into outrégeous, with 75 minutes of comedy mocking straights, “faggots” and lesbians, midgets, “fat girls” and people with Down’s Syndrome too.Which is fine, as far as it goes. No one group can claim to have been singled out for abuse – and Del Rio takes pains to reserve some harsh words for herself. Her hate speech is in any case just for flamboyant fun, right? Nothing about Roy Haylock’s alter ego invites us to take her seriously, from the “clown in a dress” stylings, via her wicked way with a side-eye and a swig of white wine, to the running joke about “my best friend” representing whichever minority she’s just dissed.Drag is low in the mix: Del Rio’s faux-femininity barely figures. But Haylock is a stellar performer his comic timing is spot-on. And his neck couldn’t be brassier: in the post-show Q\u0026ampA, he’s startlingly mean to members of his audience.But the appearance of wit – which Haylock has mastered – is no substitute for the substance. It’s fine for Del Rio to be unpleasant about everybody, but I wish she’d find new ways to do it. Instead, cliche is piled upon stereotype, as Jewish people are branded penny-pinchers, “Asians” mocked for having squinty eyes and eating dogs – and the vagina execrated as a site of bilious disgust. There are also some awfully weak punchlines, which Del Rio fails to conceal by squawking them all as loudly as possible.I found the wickedness a bit self-congratulatory too, as her change-the-subject catchphrase (“Fun fact…!”) is repeatedly deployed to advertise the outrageousness of whatever’s just been said. Others will differ: I sat next to a man helpless with laughter at Del Rio’s every gesture and tart aside. For my part, I’d happily swap a little of the performative hatefulness for insight, honesty or good jokes.

Over the past five days I have eaten hot pyshki doughnuts covered in sugar, scarfed down herring under fur coats, and gobbled barley porridge with blood sausage. I have looked askance at beef wobbling in grey-brown aspic. I’ve tasted mead and pickled mushrooms where you can practically taste the mud on the fingernails of the people who made them. I have had borscht (exceptional) and borscht (execrable) and borscht (middling). In tearing the pizza-like crust of a katchapuri and dipping it in its central egg and molten cheese vat, I have learned the joys of Georgian cuisine. Despite all this, I worry I am no closer to answering the question I set out to answer: what’s Russian food actually like?This is a culinary immersion into Russia organised by Intrepid, a travel company that likes its visitors to get under the skin of the destination. Clearly it is not without a sense of irony. After all, a Russian culinary tour sounds about as paradoxical as an English weather tour or, I suppose, an English culinary tour.“Part of the inspiration for this trip was knowing that Russia had so much more to offer,” says Neil Coletta, a trained food anthropologist who oversees Intrepid’s food tours. “But home cooking is so important here and it can be difficult to discover if you don’t know where to look.” In many countries, what and how people eat is changing quickly, but Russian food finds itself in the grip of recent specific political circumstances, as is made clear when a man offers me a cheese sample under the domed concrete roof of Moscow’s Danilovsky Market, near the Moskva river.This used to be one of the city’s busiest farmers’ markets, where Muscovites would come for their weekly shop. Like so many across Europe it has evolved into something more hipster. There are craft ales, smoothies, sushi and plenty of other concessions that would not feel out of place in Lisbon or London, but others are more specific to the region: meats from Dagestan cloudberry and dogwood jams from Karelia, on the border with Finland dried apricots and nuts from Tajikistan Armenian stuffed vine leaves chafing dishes piled high with Uzbek plov, rice cooked with carrot, onion, raisin and tender chunks of mutton.“What is it?” I ask the cheesemonger.“Gorgonzola,” he replies, with a grin. I eat it and raise an eyebrow. There’s a bluishness to it, but it has none of gorgonzola’s creaminess or texture.“Not gorgonzola,” I say.Our guide, Xsenia, steps in to explain. “The EU embargo was a positive kick for our farmers to do something different,” she says. “Before 2014, we would import cheeses, but now local providers and ordinary people are doing their own.” In other words, Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea has been an unexpected boon for Russia’s artisan food producers. Russian authorities are said to have destroyed 20,000 tonnes of banned produce, so the locals are making do. There aren’t any naming restrictions, either, when you have nothing more to fear from EU regulation. Those planning to make their own Brexit brie may find this heartening.There’s more to life than sour cream, beetroot and dill, in other words, which is not the same as saying those things don’t feature at all. As wonderfully haute as cuisine Russe can be, much of what we eat is obviously informed by Russia’s size, its climate and its history of economic hardship.The trip involves several definitions of “home cooking”, and dill, the spindly green monster of a national herb, is never far away. The first night in Moscow we visit Mari Vanna, a smart restaurant done up like a babushka’s living room, a haven of purest chintz, with doilies, floral wallpaper and a snoozing cat. Waiters bring out pickles and potato-and-mayo-based Olivier salad, herring ”under a fur coat” with its Instagrammable rainbow layers of grated beetroot, onion and mayonnaise, and various sorts of pelmeni dumping. The meal is jolly right up to the moment I discover there is a branch in Knightsbridge.Next morning we head out to Suzdal, a holy town a short train ride from Moscow, in the Golden Ring of similar sites that surrounds the capital. Its remoteness saved it during the Soviet industrialisation, as nobody could be bothered to knock the churches down, and now its many bell towers endure as a lure to tourists. A couple of bored-looking men were selling mushrooms and pine-cone jam in irregular jars. A different kind of attraction is the house of Helen Polezhaeva, a charismatic former chef who now offers at-home classes to Intrepid’s visitors. She teaches us the secrets of borscht, which she prepares using ingredients from her sprawling kitchen garden, where the bearded irises are in flower between the rows of vegetables. “Women must learn to cook borscht before they get married,” she explains. For some borscht is shorthand for dodgy former Soviet-bloc cooking, dour purple gruel. In Helen’s hands it becomes something else entirely, rich and sour and sweet and perfectly balanced, which is lucky, as she gives the impression she, and many others, still eat a lot of it.While Moscow might have the more dynamic restaurant culture, it is in St Petersburg that the clashing forces in Russian cuisine are clearest. On opposite sides of Nevsky Prospect, the city’s most famous road, which has more than 140 restaurants, are two types of canteen. Stolovaya No 1 Kopeika is a traditional Soviet-era spot, where anyone can come for a cheap lunch of average soups and dumplings. If you picture “Soviet canteen”, you’re right. Down the street is Marketplace, an international version of the same concept, where for three times the prices you can eat blackened cod and sushi and pasta and drink flat whites and international beers.Back at Taste to Eat, as I consider the kiev, I wonder if there’s a lesson to be drawn from the contradictions of Russian cooking. How it is fiercely protective of its traditions, but open to certain kinds of innovation how it is susceptible to the forces of globalisation even as embargos make trade impossible how its politicians project a froideur at odds with the hospitality of its people. About how genuinely weird its attachment to dill is. But then I am offered another toast, the same as last night’s: to new friends, and so I drink up.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

As it welcomes another world-class event, we road test three famous climbsI have achieved a sort of cycling singularity. The UK cycling scene is obsessed with professional racing, hills, Yorkshire, social media – and pretentious coffee. And a couple of weeks ago, I set out to ride the undulating West and North Yorkshire route of the 2019 Road World Championships with a small-batch coffee roaster called Ben whom I’d met on Twitter.Over the past five years, Yorkshire has become a global cycling destination. As Ben and I, and another Twitter acquaintance called Tom, rode out of Otley, north of Leeds, there were dozens of other riders heading out of town, up Wharfedale towards Bolton Abbey. None of them was in an organised group – just ones and twos, including quite a few children and teenagers. I doubt many of them were doing what we were planning: a 200km section of the men’s elite race, involving a long loop north from Otley to Hawes, east up the gloriously named Buttertubs Pass, and then south through Ripon to finish in Harrogate.I’d mentioned my plans to Otley native and 2015 world champion Lizzie Deignan. “If I press on a bit it shouldn’t take more than about six hours,” I said.There was a pause. “I think you might have underestimated that,” she replied.I found it hard to find volunteers to keep me company. I asked the local Otley club. “Bit too much for most of us,” was the response. I was undeterred. I shouldn’t have been.The explosion in Yorkshire cycling hasn’t happened by accident. In 2014, the Tour de France started in Leeds, after Yorkshire had snatched the Grand Depart from under the nose of a rival Scottish bidder – largely, so the story goes, because the then chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, Gary Verity, flew to Paris in a chartered helicopter and brought the Tour’s top brass back to Yorkshire for a pub lunch.Verity was clear about his desire to win the bid for Yorkshire. “The world’s biggest sporting event is the Olympics. We couldn’t get that: it was too big. The Fifa World Cup was too big. But the Tour de France? We could get that.”The event itself was extraordinary. No one had ever seen anything like it. Huge crowds lined the entire route, to the extent that staff in the team cars following the riders arrived at the finish with bladders the size of space-hoppers because there had been nowhere in 200km to stop for a quiet pee.The 2014 Tour de France’s legacy is the men’s and women’s Tours de Yorkshire – held every year since and sufficiently Frenchified that the climbs are now “côtes”, as in the Côte de Buttertubs and Sheffield’s legendary Côte de Jenkin Road. Cyclists come from all over the world to ride the now-famous roads. The Zwift virtual cycling app has a Yorkshire route, allowing riders on stationary bikes to sprint past Betty’s Tea Rooms in Harrogate from the comfort of their own homes. And now the week-long World Championships festival is arriving.To those of us who’ve been in the world of UK cycling for years, none of this was a surprise. Yorkshire is cycling country. It always has been. It is a wonderful place to go for a ride – as long as you like your riding hard.Ben, Tom and I had three significant climbs to get over: Kidstones, Buttertubs and Grinton Moor. The first problem is that they sneak up on you. In the Alps, you can see a climb coming for miles as you approach along the valley. In Yorkshire, the roads undulate all the time. I was halfway up the Côte de Kidstones before it dawned on me this wasn’t just another random lump – this hill was going to keep going. By that point, of course, I was committed to riding up it at an unwise pace.I suspect Yorkshire does this to you deliberately. And here is something else: in other cycling meccas, the climbs have hairpins to even out the gradient. In Yorkshire, the roads go straight up. The climbs are not long, but they are steep. It’s not at all unusual to find yourself out of the saddle, grunting to get the pedals round on a one-in-five gradient.This sort of thing might punish the unwary outsider, but it manufactures great bike riders, such as Brian Robinson, the first British Tour de France stage winner, in 1958 Barry Hoban, who won eight Tour stages between 1967 and 1975 and world champion Tom Simpson, who grew up in Harworth, Nottinghamshire, but learned his riding over the border. Deignan will get to race through her home town at this year’s Worlds. And, of course, there’s the peerless Beryl Burton, winner of seven world titles in the 1960s and 70s and an astonishing 72 UK titles at various distances between 1958 and 1986.It’s the relentlessness of the roads that makes it different. You have to work for everything. An hour’s ride in Yorkshire is worth an hour-and-a-quarter in most other places. “It’s not just that the roads are hard – the weather can be bad, too,” said Deignan. “When I turned pro, I’d find myself riding up some French mountain in the pouring rain, and that was fine.”The Côte de Buttertubs is brutally steep, an incline of almost one in five. It comes too early in the race to really play a decisive part, but it’s the climb that will produce the defining images of the World Championships. Just a few minutes away from the little town of Hawes, it feels untouched and wild.It’s barren and exposed, with no shelter beyond some low drystone walls. There are no trees on Buttertubs even the grass is close cropped by the sheep. The narrow road clings to the side of the steep valley then turns inland to run through a natural amphitheatre which, when the race arrives, will be crowded with fans and flags. It’s the essence of Yorkshire, and it’s utterly lovely. The climb took us about 20 minutes – the pros will probably do it in 13.But 200km was, as I’d been warned, too much. By the time we were heading back south towards Ripon and Harrogate, I was finding every excuse I could to freewheel for a moment’s respite. More than once I tried freewheeling only to discover that I wasn’t even going downhill, I just desperately wanted to be. Of course, I didn’t say anything. I was pleased beyond words when Tom said he was exhausted, too. “Go on ahead, if you want to get back,” he said. “That’s OK,” I said magnanimously. “Let’s back off a bit. I don’t mind at all.”The sense of achievement in getting to Harrogate (after seven hours) was immense, but I’d have to admit that Deignan and the Otley club were right. I had underestimated it. And I’d do it again tomorrow.• The UCI Road World Championships run from 22-29 September. For those who don’t fancy 200km of properly hard riding, the events are held over a variety of courses and distances, starting at 14km.

Here, for the first time, he talks about his life with the virusThe words “smoky lavender” appear twice in Over the Top, a memoir by Jonathan Van Ness, the most fabulous of the so-called Fab Five on Queer Eye, the hyperventilating makeover show in which he stars. The first time it is used to describe the skin colour of a gun-toting meth addict he encounters during a stint as a sex worker in Tucson. The second to describe the colour of the thigh-high boots worn by the hair stylist at a salon he lands at in Los Angeles in 2008. He is 19. Later, Jane Fonda, a customer, tells Van Ness his hair makes him look like Jesus.Between these two smoky lavenders is a gulf that separates two versions of Van Ness: the garrulous, sassy, resident groomer of Queer Eye – and the emotionally bruised, risk-taking addict. As he warns readers midway through the book, “Buckle up, buttercup, because I can go from comedy to tragedy in three seconds flat.”Van Ness and I are in a Cadillac sedan, driving past the tangled, rusting architecture of Philadelphia’s suburbs. Travelling like this is normal for him – on Queer Eye, he gets to roam the country waving his wand and transforming lives. The show, which was brought out of cold storage last year after an 11-year hiatus, has been a surprising success. America, it seems, is hungry for its uplifting brand of magic. A lot of that comes down to Van Ness, the show’s foremost cheerleader for Queer Eye’s stated mission of turning red (Republican) states pink, “one makeover at a time”. It’s Van Ness who brings the energy to the party, Yass queening his way through each episode, scattering memes and neologisms wherever he goes, and generally helping people connect to their feelings, often by tapping into his own. Tears are never far below the surface. Resistance is futile. Everyone loves him.Van Ness has a hectic, energetic style and a voice that soars high and then higher. In the car he talks quickly, words tumbling out of his mouth in a way that can leave you trailing far behind. When I ask if any of his encounters on Queer Eye have changed him, he answers: “The act of showing up for your family and being able to live in the world I think is heroic. There’s like 15 bajillion eggs in the ovaries and who even knows how many, like, little spermies are in there, so the fact we got to be born and be living this long is kind of like a mathematical who-knew.” This is, I think, a roundabout way of saying we all deserve to be acknowledged. But things are way more fun when Van Ness says them.For our meeting, I’d taken the train from New York to Philadelphia, where Van Ness was filming an episode of the show, with vague plans to walk to the Liberty Bell. But he’d just received a 24-hour reprieve from work and, shortly before arriving, his publicist suggested I drive back to New York with him. Sitting in the back of a car with someone you’ve never met can be awkward, and I was conflicted. But Van Ness disarms with charm. A pop culture magpie, he slides from subject to subject and dares you to keep up. How he finds time to watch so much, know so much, work so much, is a conundrum. Lately, he has learned to meditate as a way to manage his stress. “On Sundays I sometimes don’t work,” he says.We are on Route 95 somewhere outside of Philadelphia and, as we navigate the traffic, we admire his latest manicure, each nail painted to represent a different cast member of the 1996 comedy the First Wives Club, a touchstone for Van Ness.“This is Goldie Hawn getting her lips done,” he says, lifting a finger for inspection. We talk about cats – he has four, including Liza Meownelli – and we watch an old video that surfaced late last year on the Jimmy Kimmel Show. In it the 11-year old Van Ness performs an interpretative dance to Jewel’s Pieces of You – his entry in the school talent show. For the number, he wore a kabuki mask positioned on the back of his head and a baggy black T-shirt emblazoned with a question mark. The piece, inspired by an ice-skating routine, culminates in a triple-axel-style pirouette that is so wholehearted, so gutsy and so precious that it’s heartbreaking. At the time, his mother gently suggested he might want to reconsider. The other kids, she said, might not let him live it down. But when had they ever?What Van Ness knew early on was that the world of women was more interesting to him than the world of men. He recalls at the age of four telling his father’s friend that he wanted to be a cabana girl or a cosmetologist when he grew up. As an adult, he would gravitate to the term “gender queer” to express his place in the world, but that wasn’t an option in childhood. A particularly painful story conjures his father’s war on his gender exploration. “I remember very clearly my dad finding me in an evening gown with my two cousins,” he says. “He tore me out of the dress, holding me in the air so that I was perpendicular to the ground. I was terrified.”But there were pockets of joy, too. Joining the junior varsity cheerleading squad at high school at 14 was an epiphany – he felt at home immediately. When I make the faux pas of forgetting who starred in Bring It On, the cult 1999 cheerleading movie, Van Ness gasps. “I could almost throw you out of the back of this car for asking such a preposterous question,” he says. “So, you’re telling me you came to this interview not having seen Bring It On? What were you doing?”In season four of Queer Eye, viewers saw Van Ness return to his high school in Quincy to makeover his arts teacher, Cathy Dooley, a beloved figure who stood out for not making him feel different or unusual. The cameras show Van Ness performing with the cheerleading squad as students clap and whoop. It’s a moving spectacle that implies a circle has been closed. Everyone loves queer people now, even in Quincy.But what we see on screen is not the whole truth. A few weeks before the Fab Five arrived, the school had asked parents to sign permission slips for their children to be on camera, prompting protests from a local pastor. “He sent a letter to the newspaper that blasted the normalisation of LGBTQ culture, and said we should not be rolling out the welcome mats at a public school,” Van Ness says. “It was just a really nasty letter.” Nor was it just any old pastor. “This was someone who was like a family friend, someone I’d known for a very long time.” He looks glum. “I don’t think we’ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had.”Leaving small town America in order to be fully himself, only to find being fully himself is what brings him back to small town America, is an irony not lost on Van Ness. “It’s a little bit Gift of the Magi,” he says. But he also knows Quincy is his secret weapon because “even the most Republican-ass Trump supporter is someone I have grown up next door to”. Or even grown up with. Three years ago, he had to work hard to convince his father not to vote for Trump. “I cussed my dad out 300 of the days of 2016,” he says. “Our relationship literally was on thin ice over that election.” In the end, Van Ness Senior voted for Gary Johnson, the nominee for the Libertarian party. “I was really proud of him for it,” he says.When the original Queer Eye premiered on the Bravo channel in 2003, it was a more straightforward makeover show inspired by advice columns in Esquire magazine. Where it was radical was in the casting of five confident, unapologetic gay men to dish advice to hapless straight men. But people rarely cried and there was little talk of self-care. “I was just trying to get guys out of pleated khakis and to get them to cut off their mullets,” says Carson Cressley, who starred in the original. “I don’t think any of us thought the show had any sort of idea about making a political statement.” The 2018 reboot, on Netflix, repackaged the Fab Five as social missionaries spreading the gospel of love around America. A masterstroke was to take the guys out of New York, where the original show had been located, and into the heartland states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. In a fractured society, the show would open minds by showing that our similarities were greater than our differences. Or, as another of the Fab Five, Karamo Brown, said in the opening episode of season one: “We’ve all got to come together in a way we can understand each other.”There have been four seasons of Queer Eye since its debut in February 2018 and a new one will drop early next year. The show’s hosts have not wasted time, assiduously attending to their brand while they still enjoy the spotlight. Three have published books this year and this month it’s the turn of Van Ness. His memoir, Over the Top, could have been a ghostwriter’s gift, packed with his witticisms and mantras for self-care. Instead it’s a lightning bolt – devastating and stirring, powered by years of anguish and humiliation. Does he worry how fans will react to his own revelations? “I’m scared,” he admits. “But I’m ready to pull the Band Aid off.”For Van Ness, Over the Top is about charting his own path through adolescence towards the triumph that is Queer Eye, but it’s also about owning – and thereby defusing – two of the most traumatic chapters in his life. The first occurred when he was four, when an older boy molested him in a closet. Van Ness tells his parents but it’s written off as “experimentation” and swiftly passed over. That single act of abuse casts a long, pernicious shadow over the book as we witness the ways in which Van Ness acts out his confusion and pain, from taking crystal meth, to sustained binges in sex clubs that satisfy his need to be wanted. He joins a 12-step programme for sex addiction, but relapses.In the midst of all that, his stepfather, Steve, is diagnosed with bladder cancer, and told he has 11 months to live. His death, when it comes, knocks Van Ness back into the unhealthy behaviour he’s been working to quit.“Everything that happened to me that summer will always be painful to think about,” he says. “It was like saying goodbye to so much of what I wanted.”Shortly after the funeral, his former boyfriend tracked him down at a bathhouse in St Louis and Van Ness’s fall to rock bottom seems complete. Almost. When he gets sick, collapsing at the hair salon he is working at one afternoon, he already knows what a doctor will tell him a day later: he is HIV positive.Van Ness writes about these bombshells with a quiet tenacity that skirts melodrama. He wonders if his reckless behaviour was a self-fulfilling prophecy, the consequence of all the fear ingrained in him at such a young age. He wants other people not to have to go through the same thing.“It occurred to me: what if everything I’ve ever been through was preparing me for this moment – to be strong enough to share this, and to share it on my own terms,” he says. “Part of that for me is to process what’s happened, but the bigger part is that I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way around HIVAids, and what it is to live with HIV, and to humanise and normalise a lot of the things I talk about.” He blinks, then adds, “I’m talking slow because I’m trying not to cry.”We are nearing New York, and the canyons of Manhattan fill the hazy skyline. Growing up, Van Ness used to fantasise he would help other people like himself. “I always felt that was part of my purpose,” he says. “But I thought it would be a really chic juice studio with great baked goods, maybe a dance and yoga studio.” He didn’t think the way he’d help people was simply by being himself on a global TV show – or by penning a generous and frank memoir.At a certain point, Van Ness picked himself up and decided he didn’t want to throw away his life. “It really took some time to figure out how to put my life together,” he says. But medical advances mean the virus is now undetectable in his blood. He remembers the day he was given his HIV diagnosis, asking the doctor if he could still live to be 75. “She was, like, ‘I will keep you alive long enough to die of a heart attack or cancer like everyone else,’ and then she laughed uncontrollably.”Is he making time for relationships? Van Ness shakes his head. “In the past, I’ve had relationships with people who I was almost using to validate myself and my existence, and that’s not been a great plan for me,” he says. “So, this is a season of me falling in love with myself all the way.”In some ways, he thinks that testing positive for HIV has been his liberation. In the past year, he has taken up ice-skating and thrown himself into gymnastics. And, of course, there is an election to fight. “I absolutely do not think I’d have been as socially aware or conscious or want to make as much of a difference,” he says. “It gave me a reason to really fight.”Picture me in the seventh grade: a chubby, slightly snaggletoothed kid with a voluminous mop of frizzy curly hair. I’d be cycling through several of my cutest looks, usually monochromatic jumpers with severe Doc Martens boots, just to go to the mall. It felt entirely possible that a talent scout would be there, in the nation’s smallest capital of Springfield, Illinois I’d practice ice-skating routines in my living room, trying to be like the Olympians I idolised, imagining how triumphant I’d be when I finally seized that gold medal. The years of fantasising about reaching stratospheric fame through a local mall discovery had long since faded by 2017. I’d settled for much more attainable goals. I became a hairdresser, working in both LA and New York. I’d stumbled, very grate- fully, into a side hustle in the form of a web series called Gay of Thrones. That spring I would move to Atlanta to shoot a dream project with four new friends. We had beaten out the collective gay world for these five coveted positions, and we all knew it was a monumental opportunity. Like Maya Angelou taught me, I was hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst, so that nothing could catch me off guard. I was just happy that I had completed my mission of escaping cornfield-small-town-only- gay-person infamy and was now free to live an authentic queer life in a gorgeous big city with a Trader Joe’s and nobody thinking twice about my leggings.A year later in February, Queer Eye had just come out, and I was on my way to a meeting. To my shock I arrived early, so I went to grab a coffee, and as I was walking in, this lady with the most gorgeous ex- pertly done microbraids and giant glasses stopped me and bellowed, “Honey, this faggotry you are serving is giving me everything!”At first, I was confused. Did she just call me a fag? But the smile on her face and her extreme proximity seemed to suggest a loving and enamoured person. I’m now doubly confused, I’m running ahead of schedule, and strangers are stopping me. Mind you, it’s still 8.15am, my eyes still subtly perma-stoned from last night’s edible, and I hadn’t even had my coffee yet! So I said, “Thanks, queen,” and continued on my way.But then two steps later, two other girls stopped me. They said they were living for the show and asked if they could take selfies. Of course I said, “Yes, sweets!” and that caused a few more girls from outside the shop to come in for what was quickly becoming an impromptu meet-and-greet. My original encounter from the store got in line for her pic next, then be- came the photographer for the rest of the meet-and-greet. After thanking all my new friends, I left the coffee shop to head back with no coffee because I forgot. Well, that was fun. How much am I thriving right now? I thought.Crossing the street to go to my meeting, a very nice man stopped me and began playing twenty questions with me about my life, about the show, about everything. I obliged, because I’m eternally a people pleaser, and I didn’t want him to feel bad, but at that point my early arrival turned into being fully actually late to the meeting. When I was filming Queer Eye in secrecy with the boys in Atlanta in 2017, sometimes producers, or people who were familiar with the show’s revival, would ask me, “Are you ready for your life to change?” I always said, “OMG, yes! But this morning, something shifted. People knew who I was, everywhere I went.There was a girl who stopped me on the corner of Twenty- Third and Park not long after the show came out. We made eye contact for a split second and it was like an invisible Jackie Chan punched her in the stomach. She doubled over. She took a dramatic step back. “Oh my God,” she yelled. “Oh my God! Oh my God!” I was so worried about her that I stopped right there and pulled her onto the curb. We sat for a while until she pulled herself together.When people had asked me whether I was ready for my life to change, I don’t think I really understood what they meant. It wasn’t just that strangers would know who I was. It was this other thing that started to happen to me: when I looked in their eyes, sometimes, there was a little voice in my head wondering,Would you still be so excited to meet me if you really knew who I was? If you knew all the things I’d done? If you could see all my parts?Sure, there’s a part of me that’s endlessly positive. But it’s just one part. It’s a beautiful part, a strong part, and an important part, but it’s not all of it. There are other parts I want to show, parts that are a little bit scarier to get into. Like the nagging, insecure part of me that worries my positivity is faker than the hair that covers the chalkboard scalp of Donald Trump. Or the part of me that’s had sex with a ton of people—a lot of whom I wish I hadn’t. What about my irritated part, which isn’t the easiest to deal with if my people-pleasing part has been working overtime. My binge-eating part, my part that just wants to be left alone, or my part that could make you pray for me to catch permanent laryngitis because I can’t stop telling you about the Romanovs, or my cats, or the irony of the GOP that wants low taxes and even lower federal government regulation, unless it comes to regulation of people’s pregnancies, marijuana, or the fundamentally racist state and federal prison systems. Because when you have this much personality, there’s a fear lurking just below the surface: If you knew all of me, you wouldn’t love me anymore. You would no longer want me as your new best friend.Over the Top by Jonathan Van Ness is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster at £20.

As he curates a festival in Margate to celebrate the Turner prize, he discusses his collection, his podcast - and advising James Corden on what to buy Cor, Russell Tovey’s apartment is gorgeous! A New York-style warehouse-style place, with wooden floors, big windows at front and back, two light-filled bedrooms and enough space in the living-dining-hanging-out area for an army of cool cats to swing. But it’s not the flat itself that dazzles, fabulous though it is. It’s the art.As soon as you walk in, you notice it. On every wall there are canvases – huge, brightly coloured abstracts, delicate etchings, cartoon-like figures in spray paint and oils. Sculptures nestle in alcoves or stand proud on tables. One piece – a chair in the guest bedroom by Jessi Reaves – is only recognisable as art because it’s so tatty when compared to the rest of the furnishings. (“Most of my friends hate that one,” Tovey laughs. “They think it looks like it was found in a skip.”) How much art does he own? He counts up in his head: “About 250 pieces,” he says. A lot of it is in storage.Well known as an actor – one of the original History Boys, Being Human and most recently, the amazing Years and Years – Tovey has another, less-documented life. He is an absolute, stone-cold art buff: a self-taught specialist, a taste-making collector, an art “geek”. Geek is the word he usually uses about himself when on Talk Art, the podcast he hosts with gallery director Robert Diament though he could equally call himself an enthusiast. He adores contemporary art, and his passion, over the years, has led him to expertise. He hosts special in-house tours in his apartment for high-up people such as patrons of the Royal Academy and is a guest curator for Margate NOW, an art festival created to celebrate this year’s Turner prize being held in the town.From 28 September until 13 October Margate is being taken over by art: as well as the Turner prize, there will be performances and screenings, pieces placed in unexpected places, work that only lasts a few days, and other works that have been months in the making. Five hundred artists and performers making more than 60 events in total, most involving Margate citizens. Yuri Suzuki, a local artist, has created 12 horns representing 12 sections of Kent that will broadcast songs and tales sung and told by locals. Open School East has been busy working with Margate kids, as has 1927, a theatre company. Tovey – who recently bought a flat in Margate – is excited. “Culture automatically raises the status of a place and raises its quality,” he says. “And culture is something that brings people together. That’s the whole point, because it’s about humans communicating with other humans about what it is to be alive.”I am interested in all this of course but I am far more intrigued by Tovey’s flat. Can we look around? Tovey gives me an info-packed tour. It’s noticeable that he mostly chooses to highlight the female artists in his collection. The first piece he ever bought, with his cheque from the film version of The History Boys, was a Tracey Emin etching, and he has always made a point of buying women’s art: Phyllida Barlow, Rebecca Warren, Rose Wylie, who he worships. He has a lot by older artists, including the 90-year-old Venezuelan Magdalena Suarez Frimkess, who works in Venice, California Carmen Herrera, who is 104 Etel Adnan, from Beirut, in her 90s. He likes supporting female artists because he feels they have a tougher time than their male counterparts.We spend some time admiring a gorgeous work by African American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola, who, says Tovey, “creates this fantasy of these fantastical Nigerian families in images that you would normally see in white depictions of royal families. And these families have been joined by their gay sons. So it’s really imagining something that probably is never possible in Nigeria, but every one of these characters has their own story and their own place within these families.”He has a couple of Joyce Pensatos on display. A few months ago, he and Diament interviewed Pensato, maker of scary-drip versions of classic cartoon figures and comic book heroes. She died of pancreatic cancer in June, aged 77. Tovey had collected her art for a while, and they’d become friends: she requested that her last interview be for Tovey’s podcast.In just over a year, they’ve made 30-plus Talk Art programmes including lively interviews with artists – Ryan Gander and Rose Wylie – or art-friendly people (often actors) such as Zawe Ashton and Lena Dunham, and art world heavyweights – the Serpentine’s Hans Ulrich Obrist, gallery owner Sadie Coles and the director of Turner Contemporary, Victoria Pomery. The podcasts are gossipy and fun, engaging and well researched. The point, says Tovey, is to make a podcast about serious art that is approachable, that anyone can listen to.Tour done, we settle down for a chat at Tovey’s big kitchen table. As we talk, I am struck by how different he is to most actors I’ve met. Not only because of his passion for art, but because of his steady self-confidence. Most actors are insecure (understandable, given their profession), and deliberately sparkle for interviewers. Tovey is charming, friendly company, but he’s also robust. Not desperate to make me like him (though I do). The main feeling I get from him is determination.I tell him he seems like the kind of person that has an idea and then absolutely commits to following it through. “I am,” he says. “My mum says that I’m blinkered, and if I want something I get it. I think it comes from enthusiasm and I’ve never apologised for being enthusiastic. When I want to know about something – ie art – I want to know everything. I have to know everything about it.”When he was a kid, growing up in Billericay and Romford, Essex, Tovey used to collect stuff. Rocks, minerals, fossils, coins, stamps, phone cards. One day he realised he had to streamline his life, so he got rid: sold his coins to one of the coin shops opposite the British Museum, put the phone cards on eBay. He was good at art himself – he still draws, mostly cute cartoons of himself for his boyfriend, Steve Brockman, or of their three dogs – and he was “visually stimulated” as a child, buying comics featuring Ren and Stimpy, Beavis and Butthead, Rocko’s Modern Life, and watching Rugrats. It wasn’t such a big leap from those to Roy Lichtenstein, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, Mel Ramos, Patrick Caulfield. But the big “aha” moment was when he went to see the YBA Sensation show, in 1997, when he’d just turned 16 (he’s nearly 38 now). “It blew my mind,” he says. “It felt like something had shifted. People say, ooh, the swinging 60s, and I’m always like: ‘OK, cool’… Sensation was my Woodstock moment.”He went back home in a daze, and, when required by his sixth form college, Barking College, to make a speech as part of an assignment, he did one about the importance of contemporary art. He got a pig’s ear from a pet shop and put it in a tank of water to explain Damien Hirst (he called it Sow Memory). He found a bit of glass and passed it round his class, asking everyone what it made them think of. “That was my Duchamp, my ready-made.” He got a distinction. “But that was the only award I got. They chucked me out after a year.”They chucked him out because he didn’t take up a role in the college play having been working as an actor since he was 11, he’d landed some paid work and did that instead. Soon after, he started at the National Theatre, and got a life-changing part in Alan Bennett’s The History Boys. He made friends with Emin when the play was up for a South Bank award. At the party afterwards, they got on so well that she subsequently asked him to be her plus one at various dos. “It was during her miaowing phase,” he recalls. Now Emin has moved into her imperial era, they remain excellent friends.How does he find the art he likes? Initially, he says, he used art advisers but not for long. Advisers are usually there to find the work that will make the buyer the most money, and that’s not why Tovey is buying art. He wants to support emerging artists, to look after work he considers important. He has ideals. “Contemporary art, especially, is all about the moment. The artist is trying to tell their story. So I feel like if you buy art, you’re part of the dialogue about history, and you’re contributing a little bit, by looking after it, to all these stories that are going to live for ever. Art is for everyone and outlives you.”So now he finds the art himself. If he sees something he likes in a gallery, he will email: “I always say, I’m a London-based actor and collector, because some artists like being collected by an actor.” He occasionally buys in auctions: “I love it. But if you don’t win, you do feel like you’re being told off by the gavel.” And he uses social media.“The magic of Instagram,” he says. “With emerging artists, if you post a picture of their work or you comment on it, if you ‘at’ them, they normally contact you. Or you can direct message them and be like: ‘Hey!’ I’ve done this so many times where I’ve been in the States. I say: ‘Where are you?’ And they’re like: ‘In Brooklyn’, and I say: ‘Can I come do a studio visit?’”He understands and cultivates his own taste: “I oscillate between figurative, cartoony abstraction and geometric abstractions.” (Is there anything he doesn’t like? He thinks: “Gerhard Richter’s squidgy paintings. I just fucking hate them. They make me really angry. I think they’re shit.”)These days, friends ask him to be their art advisers. James Corden, another of the first History Boys, has been in touch, asking for advice: “James messaged me the other day, and I’ve got him buying work. He’s got loads of money now, so he’s like: ‘What should I do?’ I’m like, ‘Buy art!’ So he’s running stuff by me and I’m like: ‘No, don’t do that, how about this?’”When he’s not working, Tovey’s researching art, disappearing into internet wormholes. It’s how he relaxes. He re-educates himself constantly. He used to have a problem with video and sound-based work, partly because he looked at art as a collector. But now he’s into it. “My medium of choice has always been painting, works on paper and sculpture. I saw video and sound art as not so important. But now I’m like, “No.” Because it’s all about connecting and experience. And being immersive. And what’s more immersive than that?”Can he understand that some people find art difficult? “Yes,” he says. “But you just have not to be intimidated by it. Go to a museum, you’re going to see a thousand works of art. And if you find one you like and spend time in front of it, on some low level, molecularly, it will change you. That moment of culture.”He gets cross about bad art, as he does about all bad culture. He has a little rant about rubbish plays: “Imagine someone going to see a play for the first time, and they’ve saved up their money, and they get dressed up, and they get a train to London. And they have lunch before, all excited… and it’s crap. And afterwards, they don’t want to badmouth the play, they just assume that because they saw it on stage, it’s got to be good. But fundamentally, inside them, they know it’s not. That makes me sad.”This leads us, naturally, to his acting career. Tovey has a film to promote. The Good Liar, out on 8 November, stars Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren and is “a con-rom romcom”. Tovey plays Mirren’s son and he loved doing the film, adored Mirren (he calls her Dame Heaven Mirren) and the director Bill Condon. He’s quite proud because it’s a big film, “my first proper one”. I think of him as thoroughly established, but he still feels he’s known more for his TV and theatre work than the “culty” films he’s been in, such as The History Boys and The Pass. This seems, to him, to be a move into a bigger film world.And what of the future? Long term, he has two art-style ambitions. He wants to get to a financial point where he can buy a little flat and support an emerging artist to come to London for three months and live rent-free. And he wants to have a foundation, a Tovey Foundation, which shows his collection in rotation. This would be in Margate or London, “anywhere, really. It could be in Essex, maybe Billericay, make it a destination.” “This art,” he says, “I own it but it isn’t mine. I feel like it’s everybody’s. I love sharing it. I do walks and talks around my flat like it’s a museum, and I love showing off to my friends… but that’s not enough. It’s for everyone, isn’t it?”More short term, in previous interviews, he’s talked about wanting to have a baby before he’s 40. Next year, he’s going to be in New York for the whole year, rehearsing and performing in Joe Mantello’s production of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, alongside Eddie Izzard, and he plans to use that time to set some baby wheels in motion. “I’ll really be putting the feelers out on how we’re going to make this work,” he says. I’m so sure that he will make it happen that I offer congratulations. “Thanks,” he laughs. “It’s not happened yet!”Where does his confidence come from? His parents, he says, always told him he could do anything, and he’s worked hard to take advantage of his opportunities. He’s had therapy when he has felt he needed to and he has followed his passions. He tells his young relatives to work out what they want to do, and pursue that with energy. He told his nephew the other day that if he wanted to go to art school, he would pay for it, “and I shook his hand”.I feel like cheering. What a positive force Russell Tovey is.“The thing is though, I’m getting the opportunity,” he says. “It’s like when people say to me: ‘God, you work hard.’ If you’re getting the opportunity to do or have something you love, then you’re going to work hard, aren’t you, because work is more fun than fun. Because there’s people who don’t know what they want to do, or they build walls to stop themselves doing what they want to do. And that’s awful. Isn’t it the best gift to know what you want to do with your life?”Margate NOW runs from 28 Sep–13 Oct.

Police moved in to dismantle makeshift barricades set up by demonstrators, while protesters retaliated by throwing petrol bombs and setting some of the barricades on fire. Police said on Twitter that “radical protesters” possessed “offensive weapons including metal rods, slingshots and laser guns” during the confrontations.The Hong Kong government issued a statement shortly after midnight condemning the protester’s “violent and vandalistic acts”. It said the police would act to restore public order.Scuffles also broke out between the police and protesters near a light-rail station after demonstrators were accused of shining laser pointers at officers. They used fire hoses to spray water while police retaliated with pepper spray and fired several rounds of sponge bullets at them. Police later said on Twitter that the protesters had damaged station facilities with metal rods and hurled objects on to the tracks.Earlier, protesters near Tuen Mun town hall lowered the Chinese flag, trampled on it and set it on fire. A 13-year-old girl was later detained for desecrating the national flag, reported public broadcaster RTHK, citing police sources.Another demonstration started in the evening in the Yuen Long district to mark an indiscriminate attack carried out by pro-China gangsters on commuters at the local station two months ago.The protest, originally planned as a sit-in at the metro station, could not take place there after the city’s transit operator, MTR Corp, closed the station in the afternoon. But from around 8pm local time, hundreds of protesters filled the neighbouring shopping centre, chanted slogans and sang “Glory to Hong Kong” – an unofficial anthem of the protest movement.The atmosphere turned tense by late night after some demonstrators ventured out of the shopping complex and set up barricades on main thoroughfares in the area, bringing traffic to a standstill. Police flashed strong lights at protesters, who yelled profanities at officers from a footbridge. The crowds and police then got into a cat-and-mouse game across different streets in the area. Some protesters threw petrol bombs at police vehicles, before riot police charged at protesters and used teargas in retaliation.“Reclaim Hong Kong! Revolution of our era!” many protesters chanted, as they refused to leave the area despite the clouds of teargas and detention of demonstrators by officers. Meanwhile, dozens gathered on Sunday night outside the Prince Edward metro station in the Mong Kok district, where many believed people died when police attacked protesters and commuters inside a train carriage on 31 August. Some burned funeral offerings while others sang and chanted slogans.In the early hours of Sunday, police fired several rounds of tear gas from the police station in Tseung Kwan O - another out-of-town district - after dozens of protesters hurled projectiles at the station and set up makeshift barricades to block its exits. Police arrested a 13-year-old boy and a 19-year-old man for illegal assembly, reported RTHK. The boy, found carrying spray paint and a laser gun, was accused of allegedly possessing offensive weapon and tools for illegal purposes, it said.Earlier this month, the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, withdrew the controversial anti-extradition bill that sparked the wave of protests in June, but the move failed to calm unrest.The protests had by then morphed into a wider and more violent anti-government movement as resentment mounted against the police and the government, which used threats and escalating force to deal with protesters. The bill, if passed, would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.Earlier on Saturday, dozens of pro-China supporters tore down “Lennon Walls” of large collages of colourful anti-government protest messages in several districts.The installations have blossomed across Hong Kong, on and under footbridges, along pedestrian walkways, at bus stops and shopping centres. A pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up the approximately 100 Lennon Walls around the city on Saturday.The anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing on Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including the right of assembly and an independent judiciary.The demonstrations have turned ugly and tend to peak on the weekends, often with anti-government activists, many masked and in black, throwing petrol bombs at police, trashing metro stations, blocking airport roads and lighting street fires. At times, they have been confronted by counter-protesters who support Beijing.

Half-finished canvases lean against walls. The bustle and noise of the city is far away.Gresham Tapiwa Nyaude and Helen Teede are among a new wave of young artists in Zimbabwe who are attracting attention from collectors and curators worldwide. Both now work in a converted house surrounded by forest, a 40-minute drive from the capital, Harare.Almost two years after Robert Mugabe, who died this month, was ousted in a military takeover, Zimbabwe is enjoying an unlikely boom in contemporary art, despite an economic crisis and unstable, sometimes violent, politics. The success is linked to its problems, the artists say.Valerie Kabov, who runs the First Floor Gallery in the centre of Harare and represents many emerging artists, said the post-Mugabe boom had been “unequivocal”.“We’ve had a lot of international collectors coming and there is interest growing all the time … For a very small population of artists, the number of internationally successful artists that have emerged from Zimbabwe is really extraordinary.”Kabov attributes the depth of talent in Zimbabwe to a tradition of education and intellectual inquiry, and “living in a really interesting matrix”.“They cannot make work that is not important because there is nothing in their lives that is not important. There is none of this navel gazing. Here everything is real. The work comes from a really strong place emotionally … You add a little bit of skill and … boom!”Art from across the African continent has enjoyed a surge of international interest in recent years, with works newly visible in art shows, featured in the specialist media and sought after by major institutions.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn Cape Town, on one of the world’s most recognisable waterfronts, a vast new art museum, the biggest ever in Africa, opened in 2017. The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa has already been described as “Africa’s Tate Modern”. There are also new museums in Marrakech and Lagos.Last year, the prestigious Frieze magazine published a long report on contemporary art in Zimbabwe.The South African Goodman gallery is opening in London next month with a show that includes works by Kudzanai Chiurai, one of Zimbabwe’s best known contemporary artists. Another well-known artist, Misheck Masamvu, won fame when Zimbabwe invested in a pavilion at the Venice Biennale art fair in 2011.Since 2012, Kabov has travelled to international art fairs to represent her artists and boost the international profile of the country in the contemporary art world.“Zimbabweans themselves are not aware of the extreme talent in their midst, because it is not considered an indigenous tradition,” she said.The devastating economic legacy of Mugabe’s 40 year rule means artists in the former British colony face many obstacles: a lack of exhibition spaces, limited opportunities to sell their work and difficulties getting basic supplies of artistic materials.Teede is concerned that the lack of a major domestic art market will mean that little work currently being produced remains in the country.“There’s always been a crazy amount of talent here … But all the best work that is being produced at this super exciting time is being sold overseas and that is a big loss. In 50 years maybe there will be a museum and it will all have to be brought back,” she said.Many aspiring artists attend workshops run by the National Gallery, founded in 1957 and housed in a Le Corbusier-inspired building in the centre of Harare.Nyaude, who studied at the National Art Gallery for two years and was picked to exhibit at the high-profile New Museum Triennial in New York last year, said one factor driving the boom was economic.“You have a possibility as an artist to do pretty well and there is so little other opportunity so if you have a drive to make art, that’s a push factor,” he said.Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former spy chief and senior ruling party official who was confirmed as Mugabe’s successor in a contested election last year, had promised voters he would make Zimbabwe “open for business”. But foreign investment and re-engagement with the international community has been stymied by widespread human rights abuses.“Living in Zimbabwe, you are affected by the politics every day, not directly, but it is there … The absurdity of the situation defies language. You can’t speak about politics directly here.Painting is a way of working things through that you can’t think through logically,” said Nyaude, 31.Amanda Mushate, a 23-year-old artist represented by Kabov, said the biggest obstacle she faced was reconciling her creative ambitions with the expectations and habits of her friends.One recent painting, entitled WhatsApp Gold, was inspired by the intensive use of social media of many of her peers.“The biggest difficulty as an artist is to be myself, to be the real me in my social life,” Mushate said. “Other girls of my age, they are interested in their careers and don’t understand me being an artist. If they came to appreciate what I do, that would be my biggest achievement.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

I remember my mother’s tears as she sat glued to the TV, watching what looked like an earthquake. Cars buried in rubble, streets ripped open, dozens of photographers and police officers on the scene of what in my mind could only have been a natural disaster.I quickly realised that wasn’t the case – that a terrible murder had been committed. The white Fiat Croma buried in the dirt was carrying Cosa Nostra’s number one enemy, the anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone. Mafia bosses had placed 300kg of explosives under the motorway between the airport and Palermo. As the convoy of cars surrounding the Fiat got closer, the bomb was detonated, killing Falcone, his wife and three members of his police escort.Less than two months later, the same fate struck Falcone’s colleague Paolo Borsellino, killed in a car bomb attack with five members of his escort outside his mother’s apartment building in Palermo.Following the killings, the bosses from Corleone ordered champagne to toast the judges’ murders. Five days later, the government dispatched 5,000 military personnel to contain what by that point had become an all-out war against the Italian state. I was 10 at the time, and for the next four years I played football in streets surrounded by soldiers carrying machine guns. It was a show of force unknown to Italy since the end of the second world war. “Palermo like Beirut” was the headline splashed across the front pages of Italy’s leading newspaper. Sicily was on its knees, and I felt as though it was the beginning of a catastrophe. On the contrary, the bloody summer of 1992 marked the beginning of the end of the world’s most powerful criminal organisation.Now those events seem light years away. Palermo has been reborn from the ashes of those bombs and killings. On the windows of dozens of storefronts and restaurants in Via Maqueda, the lively street that runs through the city’s historic centre, is the “Addiopizzo” (Goodbye extortion) sticker, which is a pledge that the business owners have refused to pay protection money to mafia bosses. It’s just one of the many signs that today Cosa Nostra is the one on its knees.The effective demise of the Cosa Nostra empire was declared last week by one of the most prominent figures in the Italian judiciary, the former chief prosecutor of Rome, Giuseppe Pignatone.In a rare interview on TV with La7, Pignatone, who recently retired after working for the main Italian prosecution offices in the south of Italy, said: “Today the Sicilian mafia is way less dangerous than before. Today we can say that the mafia – the one capable of killing magistrates and attacking the state – has been defeated.”He is not alone in his assessment. According to numerous experts, the organisation that crafted its own mythology – inspiring films, books and television series – has never been weaker. Decimated by relentless arrests, weighed down by the recent economic crisis, short on cash and on foot soldiers, Cosa Nostra has become a paper tiger.Dead? No, because it’s still embedded in Sicilian society but transformed, yes: reduced, according to many, to the level of a neighbourhood gang.“It is very probable that today’s mafia is the weakest in its history,” says Salvatore Lupo, a professor of contemporary history at Palermo University and a renowned expert in the history of Italy’s Cosa Nostra. “The Italian state has obtained unprecedented results. Judicial pressure and the crisis it has caused in recent years is something that mafia bosses have never experienced in the organisation’s history.”Since Falcone and Borsellino’s deaths, the police have arrested more than 4,000 mafiosi, including 361 in 2011 and 300 in 2014. One of the most important arrests following the magistrates’ deaths was that of Totò “the beast” Riina, one of the most ruthless bosses in the history of Cosa Nostra.Riina, who ordered the magistrates’ killings and another 150 murders, was arrested in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. In November 2017, he died in jail while in a medically-induced coma following cancer treatment.“Riina formally remained the boss of the Sicilian mafia until the day he died,” says Sergio Lari, former anti-mafia prosecutor who for more than 10 years was head of the Palermo anti-mafia directorate and lead investigator in the Falcone and Borsellino killings. “It’s clear, however, that in recent years it was difficult for him to manage the organisation’s business interests, given his poor health and the fact that he was isolated in prison.”The truth is that no one had enough authority to take his place. Today, the most respected bosses are all in jail or have died there. They have been replaced by younger criminals who don’t seem to have the same authority as their predecessors. Rosalba Di Gregorio, one of Palermo’s leading lawyers, defended the superboss and right-hand man of Riina, Bernardo “the tractor” Provenzano. She describes the mafia as in disarray, with “new bosses who are not really bosses at all. They are men who, once they’ve served their prison time and are back on the streets, put on airs as godfathers. They think they’re bosses. The truth is that this is no longer Cosa Nostra.”Giovanni Falcone’s sister, Maria, says: “In comparison to yesterday’s bosses, who waged war against the Italian state, the new generation are chicken thieves.”Some believe that the only true godfather capable of taking the reins of the Sicilian mafia is Matteo Messina Denaro, one of the world’s most wanted fugitives, who has been in hiding since 1993. But experts, and many mafiosi, disagree.“Aside from being a dangerous criminal, the idea that Denaro could be the new super-godfather is just media rhetoric,” says Lupo, co-author of the book La mafia non ha vinto (The Mafia Hasn’t Won) with Giovanni Fiandaca. “We are persuaded to believe that his capture represents that ultimate defeat of Cosa Nostra, but Messina Denaro doesn’t even enjoy legitimacy among many Sicilian bosses.”“Messina Denaro is the last Mohican of the old mafia,” says Lari. “He may be the boss of the entire province of Trapani, but he certainly isn’t the boss of bosses of Cosa Nostra. Internal dynamics aside, he could never be the superboss for one reason: Matteo Denaro is not from Palermo, and that role is normally held by men from Palermo.”Technological advances in the fight against the mafia have played a crucial role. First and foremost is the use of wiretaps and hidden cameras. Bugs placed in bosses’ homes and hidden cameras in mafia hangouts have shed light on the new mobsters’ activities. They have led to compelling evidence in court, with bosses often receiving long sentences in maximum-security prisons.Following the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino, the notoriously harsh prison regime, first introduced in 1975, was intensified, aiming at cutting off mafia inmates completely from their former criminal associates. The new regime banned the use of telephones, any association or correspondence with other prisoners, or meetings with third parties. In order to avoid living a completely isolated life, many mafiosi decide to turn state’s witness.In Italy they are called pentiti, literally “repentant”. They are mafiosi who, in exchange for lighter sentences, have testified in court against their former associates, thereby contributing to additional arrests and the further weakening of Cosa Nostra. Today, more than 300 former mobsters are collaborating with authorities in Sicily.The economic crisis, which has hit Italy hard, has also affected the mafia. One of the mafia’s most profitable earners has traditionally been the construction sector, in which companies with ties to mafia bosses would earn millions by skimming contracts for bridges, roads and buildings. In the mafia’s golden years of the 1970s, in Palermo alone mafia-controlled construction activity was worth more than £1bn.Today the building sector in Sicily is at one of its lowest points: 73,216 people were made redundant between 2008 and 2017, and more than 5,000 businesses have closed, according to Italy’s largest trade union federation. Many mafia families have been forced to decrease the amount of protection money asked of business owners. Investigations in Palermo have even brought to light the technique of paying on an instalment plan, a strategy that, nonetheless, has resulted in arrests following reports from rebellious shopkeepers who are now less fearful of a weakened mafia and more confident that the law will be successfully enforced.In wiretaps, bosses have complained of the economic crisis and have admitted the organisation’s increased weakness.“What kind of bloody mafia are we?” asked Alfredo Giordano, a former mafioso from Palermo caught on wiretap. “The mafia of lost causes.” He wasn’t even able to recover objects that were stolen from his daughter.The mafiosi who speak today used to drive Mercedes down the streets of Palermo in the 1980s. Men who held in their hands the life or death of police officers and journalists have lost their power to intimidate.The wife of mafia boss Salvatore Spica, in a wiretap, complained to her husband: “I used €100 for my mother’s groceries, €200 for the dentist. What’s left? All I have left is spare change.”“If we had to draw a graph of the military and economic power of Cosa Nostra in the last 100 years,” says Lari, “the highest point on the curve would be the mid-1980s. From the 1990s on, with peaks and troughs, the general trend would be a decrease, up to today, where we’d find the lowest levels.”Lari believes that one of the most telling examples of the mafia’s current state of crisis is the drugs trade, “where we’ve seen an absolute monopoly on the part of Cosa Nostra transform into bilateral and subordinate agreements, often with the powerful Calabrian ’Ndrangheta”.Today, the tonnes of cocaine on the streets of Palermo and Catania, as recent investigations have revealed, are moved by the Calabrian ’Ndrangheta. Once snubbed by the Sicilian bosses, today their Calabrian counterparts forge ties with Colombian narcos, control ports, and sell their goods to the Sicilians, who have been demoted to the status of “customers”.Between 1978 and 1983, the Sicilian mafia killed more than 1,000 people. Hundreds died in the early 80s. Since the mid-1990s, the number of homicides has decreased significantly. The last five years in Palermo have seen only one homicide attributable to Cosa Nostra.It was 22 May 2017 when two hitmen killed the boss Giuseppe Dainotti, who every morning around 7.50am would ride his bike to the grocery. He took one bullet to the head and a second to the body. The residents in the Noce quarter of Palermo couldn’t make sense of what had happened, as Dainotti’s body lay in a pool of blood for 10 minutes. People had become so unaccustomed to hearing gunshots that they mistook the sounds for fireworks.Two obelisks were erected as a memorial on either side of the motorway where Falcone’s car was blown up in 1992. Hundreds of visitors stop, in both directions, to leave flowers and pray. They do the same in front of the memorial placard on Via D’Amelio where Borsellino was murdered.Gigantic masterpieces of street art on the buildings of Palermo, depicting mafia victims, have taken the place of pro-mafia slogans. The city’s scars have become monuments and an indelible reminder that in the war between good and evil, good has gained the upper hand.“The battle isn’t over,” says Maria Falcone. “My brother Giovanni said that the mafia is a human phenomenon, and like all human phenomena, it had a beginning and it will have an end. Well, despite the current crisis of Cosa Nostra, that end has not yet arrived.”Maybe the end hasn’t come yet. But at least the mafia bosses who used to drive fancy cars, buy lavish villas and feel arrogant enough to take on the Italian state, like the boss Dainotti, now move and die on a bicycle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a13af09987016659f77421643f5305fdcf164382/0_164_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25084f597dc62b2390e50a989f353e2b","title":"paris dirty image litter dog mess","story":"The French capital, despite efforts to deal with litter, graffiti and dog mess, is grubbier than everParisians living on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, a main east-west axis north of the Seine, last week found that the plane trees along their street had been “tagged” with graffiti. But it’s not new. Apartment doors, shop fronts, flower boxes, benches and lamp-posts have been covered in tags for weeks. Months even.Along the boulevard to the landmark Place de la République – looking shabby despite a £20m facelift six years ago – the homeless dozed in doorways or on benches, sleeping bags pulled over their heads. The pavements were littered with abandoned electric scooters and bicycles, and punctuated by dog mess and cigarette ends. A man walking west opened a new packet of cigarettes and threw the cellophane and silver paper on the ground.The city of light and of romance has become a dirty old town, or as locals have nicknamed it, Paris poubelle (dustbin Paris).On Saturday, World Cleanup Day, Parisians were urged to pick up the mess they and visitors have made. “Paris is definitely getting dirtier. It’s filthy everywhere. The city needs an aggressive policy to make the streets cleaner and safer,” said Matthew Fraser, professor of communications at the American University of Paris, who has lived in the city for the best part of 30 years.“Paris thrives on its own moral chaos. Nothing is organised, everything is urban anarchy. I don’t think Parisians notice it, because it’s their chaotic energy. But if you’re from the outside, or from another culture, the city is a mess.”Parisians like nothing better than to grumble and today, the state of the city is the No 1 complaint. Next March, they will vote for a new mayor and propreté (cleanliness) will be high on their agenda as the city gears up for the 2024 summer Olympics.The current mayor, socialist Anne Hidalgo, is favourite in the polls, but six months is a long time in politics. Her rivals are Benjamin Griveaux, the former spokesman for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist LREM party and the prize-winning mathematician Cédric Villani, also a member of parliament for the current government, who launched his campaign last Thursday.Hidalgo, also president of the C40 Cities climate group, is popular with many Parisians – especially those that do not have a car – for her grand schemes to discourage vehicle use and tackle pollution by pedestrianising large swaths of Paris and digging up streets to create cycle lanes. But even her fans admit that rubbish is a growing problem.City Hall spends €550m a year to get rid of the estimated 16 tonnes of dog dirt produced each day by the city’s 200,000 pets, 350 tonnes of cigarette ends, and empty 30,000 bins. And still the Paris poubelle nickname sticks. In 2016, Japanese tour operators and Japan Airlines became so worried about their compatriots being put off that they began spending weekends clearing the famous Trocadéro gardens of cigarette ends, beer cans and other detritus.Ruth Grosrichard, a professor of Arab languages and civilisation, lives just north of Boulevard Saint-Martin, in the 10th arrondissement near the run-down Gare du Nord, one of the city’s busiest stations and home of the Eurostar terminus.It is one of the most densely populated areas of an already crowded city with almost 54,400 people per square mile, Paris is the most densely populated city in Europe. Manchester, which is a comparable size, has an average of 12,200 per sq mile. The northern district’s problems are compounded by a steady influx of migrants who, for want of homes, have set up encampments in the area.Grosrichard, a campaigner with two community action groups, says for years the authorities have pushed the city’s problems – drugs, migrant camps, homelessness – away from the chic arrondissements to poorer districts in the north-east, creating a clear ide either side of the Seine.“I take a metro from the northern district where I live to the southern district where I work and it’s like two different countries,” she said. “There is a lot of indiscipline and incivility and the trouble is degradation attracts more degradation, dirt more dirt. We need proposals to break the vicious cycle.”The city has introduced “incivility brigades”, uniformed personnel with the power to fine people for leaving electric scooters or bikes on pavements (or for riding pavements on them), for dropping litter and for failing to clear up dog mess. But a poll of people on Boulevard Saint-Martin reported no sightings of them.Gosrichard said: “I have never seen a single incivility brigade in our area. Not one. We keep asking city hall where they are, but we’ve never seen any. They spend millions on cleaning the city and it’s dirtier than ever before. We can’t let things go on as they are, that’s for sure.”She added: “I’ve travelled to many other cities in Europe and elsewhere and Paris is definitely the dirtiest.”Fraser believes the problems stem more from culture than cleanliness, accusing Parisians of lacking “personal responsibility”. “The French are used to the state taking care of all their needs, they feel little obligation to take responsibility for their own actions and their consequences,” he said. “Try not picking up after your pet dog in a park in London or New York, you will get scolded by someone. In Paris, people don’t even flinch.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026362.1569152027!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greta thunberg tells leaders we are united and unstoppable","story":" Millions of young people flooded the streets of cities around the world to demand political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change, uniting in a worldwide protest inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

Photograph: Mauro PimentelAFPGetty ImagesThe world is losing a race against climate change but young people have brought about a welcome change in momentum, the United Nations general secretary Antonio Guterres declared at the UN’s first youth climate summit.His comments came after he was “keynote listener” at the opening session where climate activists including Greta Thunberg outlined what they believed should be done to avert the crisis threatening the Earth. He began his remarks by observing, “world leaders talk too much”.Mr Guterres said young people were an “essential” element in combating the climate crisis, while the gathering was “a critical milestone ahead of Monday’s Climate Action Summit”. He has asked world leaders to come with bold, concrete plans.Greta Thunberg (16) was the first speaker, delivering a short statement and explaining she wanted to leave more time for other speakers, as she would be addressing Monday’s summit attended by global leaders.“Yesterday, millions of people across the globe marched and demanded real climate action, especially young people. We showed that we are united and that we, young people, are unstoppable,” she said.Earlier she tweeted: “over 4 million joined climate strikes in 163 countries ...”If you belong to the small number of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you: this is just the beginning. Change is coming – like it or not.”Impassioned pleaArgentinian Bruno Rodriguez (19), who led school strikes in his native country, made an impassioned plea for political leadership“The climate and ecological crisis is the political crisis of our time, it is the economic crisis of our time, and it is the cultural crisis of our time,” he said.“Many times, we hear that our generation is going to be the one in charge of dealing with the problems that current leaders have created, and we will not wait passively to become that future: the time is now for us to be leaders.”“The decisions about our future are still being made largely without us,” said Marina Melanidis, a Canadian delegate. “Young people deserve to co-design their own futures – and honestly, you can’t do that without us,”Komal Karishma Kumar from Fiji, warned young people would start to hold leaders accountable at the ballot box if they did not step up efforts swiftly to address climate threats. “We will mobilise to vote you out,” she added.Pita Taufatofua, an Olympic athlete from Tonga who lives in Australia, broke down in tears describing how his Pacific island homeland had seen half of its buildings destroyed by a powerful cyclone while he competed in skiing at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.“If 50 per cent of New York disappeared, people would act. Fifty percent of my country was wiped out in one night and people haven’t acted yet.”Ireland and the Marshall Islands jointly called on Governments across the world to pledge to include young people in climate policy creation under what is known as the Kwon Gesh Youth Pledge launched at the summit. The term refers to “solemn duty” symbolising the duty this generation owes to the next generation. This initiative will feed into deliberations by heads of state on Monday.The summit brought together 1,000 young activists, innovators, entrepreneurs, and change makers committed to combating climate change “at the pace and scale needed”.Success storiesIt also featured success stories on restoring oceans, using nature-based solutions, and the use of technology to counter the worst effects of climate disruption– such as in anticipating extreme weather events.UN envoy on youth Jayathma Wickramanayake told delegates: “Global emissions are increasing, temperatures are rising and the impacts of climate change are growing ... for the 1.8 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 years, the issue is felt with far more urgency as it will shape their lives in ways never witnessed before.”How is mankind affecting the global climate and what can be done about it?"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"South Dublin council blamed as \u0026lsquothousands of creatures\u0026rsquo are killed in destruction of wetlandsGarda\u0026iacute carry out a further search as part of their investigation into torture of Quinn executiveUN chief says young people have brought welcome momentum ahead of climate summitEvidence suggests the worst predicted effects of global heating are happening quicker than anticipatedIrish College in Leuven was a bastion of learning in Europe for centuriesWorld leaders heading to New York for UN\u0026rsquos Climate Action SummitIncident occurred on Saturday evening at location on Ballyconnell to Ballinamore RoadNumbers drawn: 6, 8, 13, 15, 21, 30, with bonus number 17Global response \u0026lsquostill too slow\u0026rsquo given what\u0026rsquos facing planet, says climate ambassadorMinister for Justice updated at meeting with representatives of meat factoriesPower restored to 2,000 homes in Munster areaGRA describes cutbacks as \u0026lsquoa direct consequence\u0026rsquo of Donald Trump and Mike Pence visitsCriteria include proof of infrastructure, lead roles for people with autism, and local partnershipsBrendan Kilduff (67) believed \u0026lsquoif there isn\u0026rsquot a sing-song it\u0026rsquos a bad night out\u0026rsquo, funeral toldConsultant burnout impacting on patients with diminished quality of care, says IHCAAcute hospitals face \u0026lsquohorrendous\u0026rsquo winter if \u0026lsquoAussie flu\u0026rsquo hits Ireland, conference hearsS\u0026eacuteamus Hegarty (79) was criticised for his handling of allegations of clerical abuseFormer IBRC chair says \u0026lsquoquite a number of people\u0026rsquo failed to accept Quinn empire was \u0026lsquoon the brink of extinction\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute investigating incident in Cabra, Dublin on Friday nightPolitical headwinds against radical change, especially from the US, may frustrate agenda"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.US military apologises for threat to blow up millennials if they stormed Area 51 Labour Party conference: Emily Thornberry says party must decide Brexit position \u0026#34now\u0026#34 as party tears itself apart over the issueComment: Of course Labour wants to abolish Ofsted.

Granted, it wasn’t so hard to fall for the charms of its marketing campaign. Released in the grim haze left behind by Batman v Superman (more on that later), Suicide Squad looked us in the eye and promised us an antidote to what had come before. It told us it would be the neon-splattered, anarchist baby brother of the DCEU. All that arrived was the adolescent part. Too much of Suicide Squad is spent on its over-edited character introductions: each arrives on screen with a classic rock track blaring and some meaningless onscreen text (what’s the point of Captain Boomerang’s “unicorn fetish”, again?). All ultimately wasted once the (anti-)heroes are tasked with defeating the DCEU’s most half-baked villain, The Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). She’s a character so devoid of interest, the worst crime she’s guilty of is piss-poor archeology skills.27 6. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)Although more cohesive in its vision than Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman suffers because that vision is almost entirely delusional. What is presented to us as a philosophical epic – a treatise on morality and personal responsibility – is instantly undone by a series of ludicrous decisions on the part of the film’s director, Zack Snyder. Chief among them, the now-infamous reason that Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill) finally stop pummelling each other and decide to become super friends: their mothers were both called Martha. And why again did Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) have any interest in making these two titans fight? The film’s plot is wildly incoherent, but it only becomes a true chore after the realisation that even Gal Gadot’s introduction as Diana PrinceWonder Woman isn’t enough to lighten the film’s funereal tone.Justice League contains, at its heart, a story that was only half-realised. Zack Snyder stepped down from his duties as director, following the tragic death of his daughter, Autumn. They were intensely difficult circumstances that didn’t necessarily come with easy answers for the future of Justice League. Warner Bros, however, made an odd choice in inviting Joss Whedon to complete the film. The quip-heavy, energetic style he brought to Marvel’s Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron clashed abrasively with the weightiness of what Snyder had already shot. Yet, Justice League at least has the advantage of showcasing the characters that the DCEU has now bet their future on, with charismatic turns from Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman, and Ezra Miller’s The Flash.47 4. Man of Steel (2013)As the onscreen debut of Cavill’s Superman, Man of Steel at least benefits from a fairly straightforward, linear storyline that duly ticks off the various demands of an origin story. Elements of the film feel over laboured: the Jesus imagery is excessive for a character whose parallels with a religious saviour are already obvious, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner)’s death scene seems unnecessary, and the film concludes with a seemingly endless destruction fest. Yet, after Superman IV: Quest for Peace (1987) and Superman Returns (2006) turned the franchise into a joke, an approach as sombre as that of director Zack Snyder felt right for the character at the time, flaws aside. Whether he made the right choice in violating Superman’s usual no-kill policy, by having him snap General Zod (Michael Sheen)’s neck, is up for (usually lengthy) debate.Aquaman is far from perfect, but credit has to be given to director James Wan for taking such a huge risk with the film and standing by it, even in its most ludicrous excesses. This is a bombastic adventure. And it’s all anchored by its star Jason Momoa, who manages to turn a character who, for years, has been the butt of the joke, into DC’s new party jock hero. Momoa made the man-who-talks-to-fish cool. Unfortunately, it’s also an audience ider: either you buy into the giant crab warriors and the octopus playing drums, or you get distracted by the lazy plotting and the weak dialogue. Unfortunately, beneath all the fishy visuals, the film’s story gets swamped by exposition and an unconvincing central romance.Shazam! centres on a troubled 14-year-old orphan (Asher Angel) who has the power to transform into a Superman-type character (a visibly delighted Zachary Levi) by saying the film\u0027s title. Borrowing heavily from Tom Hanks\u0027s Big, the film breezes along, playfully skewering superhero tropes and concluding with a light-hearted, low-stakes climax. Sure, there are segments that drag, and the superhero fights are a little too long, but Shazam! finally gives the world a coherent and fun DCEU film. With this and Aquaman having been released back-to-back, the darkness of Snyder\u0027s Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman seems but a fever dream.When Patty Jenkins entered the ring to direct Wonder Woman’s first solo film since her inception in 1941, she brought something to the DCEU that arguably hadn’t been seen before. Wonder Woman has heart. It’s a film filled with characters you can believe in, root for, and idolise. Although it stumbles at times – its main villain is dull, its side villain is under-used, and its finale relies far too much on CGI – those weaknesses pale in comparison to how beautifully crafted Wonder Woman’s own personal journey is. We see what courage and sacrifice represents, and what it means to fight for the good of others. It’s a rare thing to see a superhero film place at its centre the true ideals of heroism – kindness, justice, and love – and have them all embodied in one character. And with Gal Gadot exuding both power and compassion in equal measure, it’s no wonder that so many uphold her as the bright spot of the DCEU.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, Airbnb declined to mention whether the company itself had made a profit this quarter.Airbnb’s most recent funding round valued the firm at $31bn but investors have increasingly cooled on much-hyped tech companies this year.Created with Sketch.Airbnb\u0027s most liked properties on Instagram in 2018 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Airbnb\u0027s most liked Instagram post of 2018 is located at Lake Wakatipu, Queenstown, New Zealandthe Lazzarella Room in Old Mill on the Amalfi Coast, Ravello, ItalyThe Willow Treehouse in Upstate New YorkThe Joshua Tree Campover Cabin is situated in more than 22 acres of landThe Beautiful Riad in Marrakesh, Morocco, was the fifth most liked post of 2018The only way to reach the Boat House in New South Wales, Australia, is by boatVintage Design and Contemporary Art, Trastevere, Italy Piano di Sorrento in Italy offers incredible views of the Amalfi coastlineAirbnb\u0027s most liked Instagram post of 2018 is located at Lake Wakatipu, Queenstown, New Zealandthe Lazzarella Room in Old Mill on the Amalfi Coast, Ravello, ItalyThe Willow Treehouse in Upstate New YorkThe Joshua Tree Campover Cabin is situated in more than 22 acres of landThe Beautiful Riad in Marrakesh, Morocco, was the fifth most liked post of 2018The only way to reach the Boat House in New South Wales, Australia, is by boatVintage Design and Contemporary Art, Trastevere, Italy Piano di Sorrento in Italy offers incredible views of the Amalfi coastlineShares in taxi companies Uber and Lyft, which both floated this year, are languishing well below their respective IPO prices.Flexible office space provider WeWork was forced to shelve its IPO this week after scant interest – and no little criticism – from Wall Street, even after it slashed its valuation.Unlike WeWork, Airbnb has not had to deal with questions over the viability of its business model, but it faces a variety of legal obstacles in a number of the locations where it operates.Paris and Barcelona are among dozens of cities that have enacted tough restrictions on what properties can be rented via Airbnb and by whom.Last year, Barcelona authorities ordered Airbnb to remove 2,577 listings that were found to be operating without the correct licence from the city.In 2015, Paris launched a crackdown on homes deemed to be specifically used for the purposes of Airbnb rentals, rather than owner-occupied properties that were occasionally rented out.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions. Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Thomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspDover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions. Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Thomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspDover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

So we’ll keep on raising standards in education through our new model of inspection and we’ll continue to keep the most vulnerable in society safe, through our regulation of children’s social care services across England.”Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, welcomed the announcement.“Ofsted has been a force for lowering school standards by driving teachers from the profession,” she said.“Tens of thousands of hardworking, competent and professional school leaders and teachers have given up the profession, defeated and worn down by excessive workload and stress caused by trying to second guess what the latest Ofsted ‘fad’ is.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The logic is that, should the hatch never be created, Oceanic Flight 815\u0026nbspwill never crash on the island. The flashsideways show\u0026nbspwhat would have happened had the plane\u0026nbsplanded safely\u0026nbspin Los Angeles.All season long, viewers see the characters rubbing shoulders with one another in LA, unaware of the events of the past\u0026nbspfive seasons.Eventually, these characters\u0026nbspare drawn\u0026nbsptogether and they begin to recall\u0026nbsptheir time on the island, which leads\u0026nbspto the final scene’s revelation: they are dead in the\u0026nbspflashsideways, which are essentially\u0026nbspa netherworld the survivors created in order to congregate so they can\u0026nbspmove on to “whatever comes next” together.So, to clear up the confusion: in\u0026nbspthe flashsideways\u0026nbspscenes,\u0026nbspthese characters are dead. But no, they were not dead all along after their plane crashed.The flashsideways\u0026nbspscenes\u0026nbspdepict an afterlife that the characters constructed for themselves due to the fact that their time on the island – which was completely real from start to end – was\u0026nbspthe most important part of their respective lives.The characters present in that final church scene are characters both dead and alive in island time, meaning\u0026nbspseveral characters (including Kate, Sawyer and Claire) went on to live a full life beyond the series finale.These flashsideways\u0026nbsppresent a purgatory-of-sorts, where these characters\u0026nbspcome to when they eventually\u0026nbspdo die\u0026nbspwhenever that may be. When broken down, it’s a beautiful and reassuring depiction of the afterlife.The plane crash, the smoke monster, the hatch, the island – it was all real.Of course, it almost all ended rather differently...Find a ranking of every single Lost episode here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Months ago, that was the date that a college student typed into a joke Facebook event, before writing the words that would go on to make it become a day of angst for the US military and residents who live near Area 51.Next to that date, a bored young man called Matty Roberts writes an event description that would propel the page to viral fame.“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” it read.Now that the day has arrived, the mission to “storm Area 51” looks very different than it did during that moment of excited viral fame. It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.The event began as a joke.

Lets see them aliens.”The page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.Storm Area 51 event could be disaster, locals fearBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base – and US Air Force spokesperson\u0026nbspLaura McAndrews\u0026nbspwas one of a number of officials who\u0026nbspgave a stern warning to anyone who did.Ms McAndrews added: “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Last month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would have thought that similar memos fly around the BBC every day.”Created with Sketch.

allowing the left-dominated body to appoint an interim successor if the leader resigns or is incapacitated, rather than the deputy automatically taking over.The manoeuvring over Mr Watson’s position has sparked speculation that factions within Labour are preparing for a handover of power by 70-year-old Mr Corbyn, amid claims that he is tiring of the job.But asked\u0026nbspwhether he was considering retirement, Mr Corbyn dismissed the suggestion as “wishful thinking by some people” and insisted he was “enjoying” the work.“I’m taking the party into the general election,” he said.Challenged over whether he would serve a full five-year term as prime minister, which would see him in Downing Street until he hits 75 in 2024, he replied: “Of course, why wouldn’t I? I’m very surprised at this question.”Mr Corbyn said he was not aware that a motion to abolish the deputy leader\u0027s office was set to be tabled at Friday\u0027s eve-of-conference meeting of the NEC\u0026nbspand was not present for the vote, which failed after opponents of Watson led by Momentum chief Jon Lansman failed to secure the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the chair\u0027s ruling that it was out of order.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Facebook event have proved unfounded, with fewer than 200 people turning up at the gates of the secretive US military base.Most of those left peacefully after heated warnings from police, although authorities said two people were arrested at perimeter of the remote facility in Nevada. \u0026nbspIt was a far cry from the millions who signed up to Storm Area 51, a joke Facebook event which suggested attendees “all meet up” to “see them aliens” at the base which conspiracy theorists claim holds evidence of extraterrestrials.The event page was later shut down following condemnation from American authorities and locals, who feared a “disaster” if huge crowds descended on the harsh desert area where internet, phone signal and credit card facilities are scarce.But the\u0026nbspinvitation nonetheless\u0026nbspspawned alien-themed festivals in the tiny Nevada towns of Rachel and Hiko nearest the military site.Created with Sketch.Storm Area 51: Hundreds at US

One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.The entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Centre souvenir store in Hiko.Owner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.Authorities reported no serious incidents related to the festivals, which were\u0026nbspscheduled to last until Sunday.Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u0027t know.YouTuber sentenced to jail after attempting to film Area 51People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve, he said. Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u0027t go. When you tell people they can\u0027t do something, they just want to do it more.Eric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events. Still, neighbours braced for trouble after more than two million people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time, said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against critters, snakes and scorpions, he warned.It will get cold at night. They\u0027re not going to find what they\u0027re looking for, and they are going to get angry, he added.The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby airspace, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Andrew Buncombe reports from AustinTexas’s imposing state capitol, with its Goddess of Liberty statue reaching more than 300ft into the sky – higher even, than\u0026nbspthe one in Washington DC – has seen plenty of history.\u0026nbspIn recent years, none has been more memorable than a day in the summer of 2013 when a Democratic legislator, Wendy Davis, rose to her feet to try and block proposed restrictions on access to abortion. Her feet clad in pink running shoes, Davis spoke without pause for 11 hours. People gathered to watch as the afternoon slipped into evening, and as the cut-off deadline of midnight approached. A buzz grew in the marbled chamber, and reached across the nation.Eventually, Republicans would pass the new restrictions, but that hot June night belonged to Davis and her filibustering on behalf of women’s rights. Barack Obama tweeted from the White House: “Something special is happening in Austin tonight. #StandwithWendy.”Six years later, Davis, 56, is back in the fight, one of a huge number of Democratic women candidates looking to turn Texas blue in 2020. Of a minimum of 1,600 so-called “political elections” the party is contesting,\u0026nbspmore than half feature women.“Texas is the biggest battleground state,” says Brittany Switzer, senior brand manager with the Texas Democratic Party. “The majority of Texans are women, the majority of donors and volunteers are women. We’ve seen that in the last couple of years, women are running for office.”Texas would be a massive prize. The second largest state both in terms of geography and population, it also carries the second highest largest number of\u0026nbsppresidential electoral college votes – 38.For a century, Texas was a Democratic stronghold. But for the past four decades it has been solidly red Republican turf. The last Democrat to hold a statewide office was in the 1990s, and the party’s last presidential candidate to win here was Jimmy Carter in 1976.Democrats believe change is under way, and point to various clues. The 2018 midterms saw Democrats pick up a handful of seats in the House of Representatives, and Beto O’Rourke’s long-shot challenge to Ted Cruz in the Senate race stunned both parties. In the end, Cruz held on 51-48, but Republicans were forced to spend millions on a race they assumed they would hold with ease.This year, at least six Republicans from the House have announced they are standing down,\u0026nbspthe so-called “Texodus”. Among them is Will Hurd, the only African American Republican congressman.\u0026nbsp“There are two things happening,” said Matt Angle, a Democratic strategist and founder of the Lone Star Project, a political action committee (PAC) that funds Texas candidates. “One is the demographic changes, especially in the suburbs of places like Houston. The other is what the Republican Party has done it has pursued isive policies to hold onto power by sidelining African Americans and Latinos, rather than trying to win some of these voters.”The women running in Texas, with its mythologised swagger and self-confidence, are doing so up and down the ballot.\u0026nbspMJ Hegar, a 43-year-old air force veteran who served in Afghanistan and who last year narrowly failed in her bid to win a House seat, is trying to better O’Rourke and defeat Republican senator John Cornyn.“I’m not taking any money from corporate PACs (because I answer to Texans, not the special interests), so every goal we set really matters,” she said in a recent email to supporters.In Texas’s 26th congressional district, which includes Dallas-Fort Worth, 26-year-old immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros has received the endorsement of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that in 2018 helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to congress. Amanda Edwards, a member of Houston’s city council, is also running for the Senate and will face off in a Democratic primary involving Hegar and at least three other candidates.“It’s time for women to have a seat at the table” she says, speaking from Houston. “We have to give women an opportunity to lead.”Edwards says she is basing her campaign not on finger-pointing or playing the blame game, but on showing she can build coalitions. She says voters she speaks to\u0026nbspwant their representatives to “get to work”, even while their inidual priorities may differ.“They have seen politics played, and politics played out. They want people to get focused,” she says. “What is constant\u0026nbspis the disdain and lack of satisfaction with the status quo. I have no doubt this is a change election.”While Texas has vast concentrations of wealth, it also has massive levels of poverty.\u0026nbspUp to one in six Texans have no health insurance, the highest level in the nation. Around one in five Texan children live in poverty. A black or Hiic youngster is three times as likely to live in poverty as a white child.Gina Ortiz Jones, 38, a military veteran who served in Iraq, is running for the vast\u0026nbsp23rd\u0026nbspcongressional district, the one being vacated by Will\u0026nbspHurd, and which stretches hundreds of miles along the border with Mexico, from San Antonio to El Paso. She says it is larger than 30 US states.“Wherever I am, the number one issue is healthcare. The issue might be a little bit different, but the overarching issue is healthcare. Whether it’s the cost of prescription drugs, or you can imagine – if you’re living in one of our rural communities – it’s the challenge of just getting to a healthcare facility and them hopefully having the ability to provide the care you need.”She adds: “It’s a district where were we absolutely need to invest in infrastructure like broadband to be able to realise things like telemedicine and\u0026nbsptelepsychiatry, practices and technologies that exist but for which we lack the infrastructure.”Jennie Lou Leeder, a seventh-generation Texan whose grandfather purchased the family farm in Kerr County in 1882, is running for one of the most closely watched races, the 21st congressional district, which includes parts of Austin and is currently held by Chip Roy, an outspoken Republican. To take him on, she will first have to win the Democratic primary, which will also include Davis.In a bookshop on the edge of Austin, Leeder says she has received much support for an agenda that stresses diplomacy over border walls, and LGBT+ rights.“I have travelled through the 10 counties that make up my district. What I am hearing from people, is what I believe too,” she says. “Everyone has the right to affordable healthcare. Everyone should be able to turn on the tap and have safe, clean drinking water. Our air should be safe to breathe. Our food should\u0026nbspbe safe to eat. Everyone should be able to drive on good, safe bridges.”One of the most important races\u0026nbspwill be for the state legislature, which has long rested in Republican hands. It is crucial for a number of reasons, not least its role in drawing up new state and federal voting districts following the 2020 census. Democrats say these have long been gerrymandered in favour of Republicans. The party needs to flip nine seats to take the lower chamber.Donna Howard, a state representative from Austin, says women are stepping forward in Texas “because they are fed up with the agenda” being set for them. If there were more women elected to office, she says, more attention would be focused on issues such as healthcare and education.\u0026nbsp“After the election of Donald Trump, we saw lots of people coming out and saying ‘I have to do something’. Some of these were suburban women,” she adds. “It was galvanising for the so-called soccer moms who are offended by Trump.”Reports suggest Republican leaders in Texas have already sounded the alarm, aware of how the Democrats were in 2018 able to take back control of the House of Representatives with the votes of educated, suburban women once again being targeted by their rivals.Earlier this year, Politico said the party had massively increased fundraising goals in an attempt to hang on to seats following\u0026nbspO’Rourke’s run. The GOP’s fortunes are not helped, the party admits, by a scandal hanging over the statehouse, amid allegations the Republican speaker sought to have some of his own colleagues defeated. The accusations have been denied, but senior Republican Dan Patrick, Texas’s lieutenant governor, told a radio interviewer: “2020 is going to be a tough year, politically.”Robert Solera, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), says Democrats may be overly optimistic.People warned to stay indoors as storm Imelda brings ‘extreme’ floods Texas governor refuses to recall legislature to confront gun violenceThanks to Trump, Democrats are taking over in TexasPete Buttigieg was brave to call climate change a religious crisis“In 2018, Democrats had their best election in a generation,” he says.“But they were still not able to win any statewide seats. They were able to pick up a few House seats, and they narrowed the margins in some statewide races, but they did not win any.”He adds: “Texas is one of the fastest growing states in the country. People are moving there because have seen the benefits of Republican leadership.”Roy’s office said he was unavailable for an interview and failed to respond to written questions.Harvey Kronberg, an expert on Texas politics and founder of the bipartisan Quorum Report, says six or seven House seats currently held by Republicans are vulnerable, as is the state legislature. With the right candidate, he says, and if the party was prepared to invest big time in advertising, those 38 electoral college votes might also be up for grabs.“This election is going to be a referendum on Trump. Trump underperforms in the polls here, except among activist folks,” he says. “I don’t think he’s helped himself\u0026nbspvery much. Agriculture is hurting. Oil and gas prices are down.”He adds: “Depending on who they nominate, Texas is in play.”After Davis captured the eye of Obama when she delivered that 2013 filibuster, she used the momentum to run for governor in\u0026nbsp2014, but lost by 20 points to\u0026nbspGreg Abbott. There has even been talk of a movie, and she reportedly met with\u0026nbspSandra Bullock\u0026nbspwho had expressed an interest in portraying her.“Women in Texas are no different than in other parts of the country. They want good, safe schools for their kids.\u0026nbspThey want clean air and water for their families,” says Davis.“And they want to know that their kids will have an opportunity to inherit a sustainable planet and will have an opportunity to realise their dreams.”\u0026nbspHouse of Representatives\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The cramped conditions, and isolation of iniduals, makes this industry unavoidably cruel.“For animals that are adapted to roam vast distances every day, living in a tight cage is torture.”\u0026nbspFur farms have been banned in the UK since 2000, but it’s estimated that since then Britain has imported more than £650m\u0026nbspworth of animal fur.Opponents of the trade say Brexit is a chance to ban imports, which was impossible under EU single market rules.Vets, animal-behaviour experts and Springwatch host Chris Packham have called for the UK to stop supporting the trade.Animals resort to cannibalism on fur farms linked to top UK brandsRescuers said at least one fox needed an amputation because of painful foot abscesses.Connor Jackson, chief executive of Open Cages, said: “While it is outrageous to see beloved dogs kept in cages on fur farms, this is a reality for terrified foxes and minks daily – until they are violently killed and skinned for their fur.”Fur trade chiefs said the farm was not legal and that they had notified prosecutors that the farm may have been conducting illegal breeding.But Open Cages said the farm was legal as it was “in the register of the main veterinary inspection”.Fur farms have been accused of causing not just agonising physical injuries and infections that go untreated, but also psychological stress and even cannibalism.Some of Britain’s most upmarket department stores and fashion websites still sell fur clothing.The Independent\u0026nbspcould not contact the farm, but the Polish\u0026nbspFur Breeders’ Association said it was shocked by the “disgusting” way animals were treated there.The farm owner, an 83-year-old, also kept cats and goats, and was not a member of the association, a spokeswoman said.Daniel Chmielewski, chairman of the association, said the place had been a fox farm but it was no longer officially registered as such and not subject to state checks.“We do not have information about how many animals have been kept on this farm as it is not a functioning fur farm\u0026nbspbut I assure you local authorities are handling the case, as they do in all cases of animal neglect.“There exist\u0026nbspno incentives to farm dogs and cats for their fur in Europe. The sale of pelts, as well as farming of dogs and cats for fur, is strictly forbidden by EU law.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His new stance is even more laughable than last week’s, when he pledged to negotiate a “better” EU deal but campaign against it.Now he would put his deal to a second referendum but express no preference between that and remaining in the EU.He hasn’t a clue. He couldn’t say. It’s too hard. The Leader of the Opposition’s mind is a blank — not for the first time.He would merely “carry out whatever the people decide” . . . er, exactly as Boris Johnson would be doing NOWLabour wasn’t blocking him.Why does Corbyn, having failed to respect the first vote, imagine anyone trusts him to enact the result of a second The only certainty is that he WILL sell Leavers down the river, as The Sun predicted.Corbyn’s “Leave” deal would keep us in the EU’s customs union, handing it control of our economy while surrendering all our political influence.That’s the worst possible option. It’s not “leaving” at all. It’s Remain by another name. Corbyn is too dim to see it.His second referendum would thus be “Remain minus” vs Remain — a farce, absurdly biased and totally illegitimate.This coward, ditherer and fool could yet run the country, God help us.REMEMBER how our “broken” economy only works “for the few” Inflation is now just . per cent as pay leaps by . per cent, its fastest in  years.Everyone’s standard of living is rising.Remember Project Fear’s scares about the immediate catastrophe of voting Leave  A pack of lies.Unemployment is at a -year low, employment at an all-time high, thanks to new full-time jobs.Remember how the City would become a jobless wasteland  It is still easily the biggest global foreign exchange hub and pulling even further away from the competition.If this is how Britain shrugs off political mayhem, imagine what we will do once Brexit is done and uncertainty lts.VANESSA George’s crimes were wicked beyond belief.Some of the children she violated still suffer.

Not unless we want to be ruled by unelected judges and unelected millionaire litigants, on top of unelected peers and unaccountable Speakers.Andthese judges do now demand Parliament’s recall, what will Remainer MPs do with all their new sitting time They have already passed their law to “prevent No Deal”. And they are too ­terried of voters’ rage to topple the Government and face an election.What  is there  Unless they intend to go for broke and deploy their own Bercow-backed pseudo-Government to revoke Brexit entirely.This case has been an act of stupid, reckless constitutional vandalism — undermining the PM just as progress towards a new deal IS being made, as even Jean-Claude Juncker concedes.As for the spurious arguments against Boris, we recoil at the hypocrisy of John Major claiming that letting a PM suspend Parliament could enable future ones to axe elections or scrap the Army.Such scaremongering fantasies didn’t trouble him in  when HE did it — and swerved scrutiny over a bribery scandal engulfing his MPs.“This case is not about Brexit,” claims Supreme Court president Lady Hale.Pull the other one.THE Sun is proud to have taken a stand for disabled kids and their families, hit hard by Government cuts.And we’re honoured that the public interest journalism of our Give It Back ­campaign won the Media of the Year award from the charity Sense. The real prize, though, is that the ­Government IS listening. It must now reinstate the £million taken from respite care and vital equipment.Then we will truly celebrate.AFTER  years of negotiation, the EU’s huge trade deal with South America is vetoed by a single Austrian sub-committee.Proving two things: That an organisation so unwieldy is virtually incapable of making trade deals and Britain will be infinitely more nimble outside it.And that it is, sadly, delusional now to believe we could strike one with Brussels before the hated backstop kicked in.That’s why it must be killed off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

deal with the EU then put that and Remain to the country in a second referendum.And which side would Corbyn be on  Well, he’ll get back to you on that. Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Read it, and it becomes very clear what lies behind the climate strikes.It is really the anti-capitalist movement — the lot who used to demand an end to globalisation — in green disguise.Astonishingly, it opposes not just nuclear energy but also “mega hydro” , biofuels and carbon capture and storage.These are all technologies central to the Government’s ambition to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by .Yet FridaysfortheFuture wants the world to move to zero carbon energy by  —  years earlier.How on Earth does it expect to achieve that  It wants humanity toto living in pre-industrial conditions.And it wants to “support non-market approaches to climate action”.In other words, it wants some kind of primitive socialist society.The trouble is thatwe went back to living in pre-industrial conditions we would very rapidly end up with pre-industrial levels of hunger, disease and child mortality.There is another way to tackle climate change, which is to invest in renewable energy and other low-carbon tech through a liberal, market economy to build a proper energy infrastructure.Children are right to be concerned about the planet, but they might care to take a closer look at the  ideology behind their climate strikes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He quit Labour to be an independent MP in February over the “culture of extremism and intolerance” created by Mr Corbyn.Today Mr Austin launches cross-party campaign group Mainstream, aimed at combating extremism in public le.He said: “I grew up listening to my father, a Holocaust refugee, warning of the dangers of prejudice and hatred.“I joined Labour as a teenager and campaigned for it all my adult le.“But the party of today is not the one I grew up in.“Under Jeremy Corbyn it has been poisoned by a culture of extremism and intolerance. It is the responsibility of everyone who opposes extremism in all its forms to stand up against this destructive force.”The poll found  per cent are proud of Britain’s history over the past  years, with  per cent “ashamed”.Only  per cent believe in retaining the monarchy while  per cent want a republic.Twenty per cent would be “happy” or “proud” to sing the anthem but half would be “bored, embarrassed or angry”.More members,  per cent, blame the Government for the atrocities of the Troubles than blame Republican terrorists like the IRA .Just  per cent think groups like al-Qaeda are the most to blame for Islamist terrorist attacks in the UK. A total of  per cent think the UK and its allies are most to blame, while  per cent blame both sides equally.Meanwhile  per cent support using strikes to overthrow a Conservative government.A huge  per cent agree with getting rid of Britain’s nuclear weapons. Almost half,  per cent, want to abolish our country’s borders.A total of  per cent support new laws limiting who owns national newspapers. And  per cent say a Labour government should take more control of broadcast media.We stand up to extremism, racism and prejudice. That’s the British way.Sun readers expect their government to defend their country abroad, maintain their security at home and keep their streets safe. They certainly don’t expect a party which might be in power in just a few weeks to tear itself to pieces in the way Labour has done in the last  hours.Tom Watson has given the party he loves decades of service. But because the extremists who now control Labour don’t trust him to bow to all of their demands, they tried to abolish his job while he was at home looking after his son.Mainstream is a new campaign to stand up for these values and warn people of the dangers of extremism.We will promote respectable and responsible politics wherever we can, and we will oppose extremism - wherever it comes from.We’ll oppose extremism on the far left or the hard right, and today we are highlighting the impact of a government led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left.I thought I knew how badly Jeremy Corbyn had poisoned the Labour Party.I quit after  years as a member to shine a spotlight on the extremism and racism.But even I was shocked by this new poll showing what Labour members now actually think.Under Corbyn, half say they would be bored, embarrassed or angryasked to sing the National Anthem.Just  per cent are proud of our country’s history. Almost three times as many are ashamed.More than six out of ten want to abolish the monarchy and more of them blame the British Government and our brave army than the IRA and other republican terrorists for the violent troubles in Northern Ireland.Almost half want to abolish our country’s borders and nearly seven out of ten members think it would be ok for trade unions to hold a general strike to remove a Conservative Government.More than half either blame the media or Jeremy Corbyn’s political opponents for the allegations of racism against Jewish people instead of the members responsible or the leadership that has allowed it to happen.Sixty-nine per cent of Labour members now blame Western Governments instead of Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS for Islamist terrorist attacks on the streets of Britain or think they are equally to blame as groups like Al Qaeda or ISIS!You would never have got results like that under previous Labour leaders, but the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left is completely outside Britain’s mainstream political traditions. They can’t be trusted to uphold our country’s values or safeguard the institutions on which our democracy depends.Corbyn’s supporters claim he is ing the party to its socialist roots, but it’s just not true.Clement Attlee’s great post-war government established the NHS and the Welfare State, but he was a proud British patriot who set up NATO, insisted on Britain having nuclear weapons and booted communists out of the party.There are still decent people in the Labour Party, fighting for common-sense, but good MPs have been targeted, smeared or driven out and all sorts of people from the fringes of politics have joined to support Jeremy Corbyn.All this explains why we are setting up Mainstream, a new campaign - led by a group of people from dferent political backgrounds – to encourage ato respectable and responsible politics, and to banish extremism from British politics once and for all.To lead Britain, you must love this country, but Jeremy Corbyn is the opposite of a patriot. He could not be trusted with our national security or to defend our country. At every available opportunity, he has backed Britain’s enemies, whether that’s the IRA at the height of the Troubles or groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.No previous Labour leadership would have supported dictatorships in Cuba or Venezuela or have sided with the Russian dictator’s line on Ukraine or when his killers used chemical weapons to bring death to Salisbury. The hard-left think that wealth is the problem and the people who create it the enemy. A government led by Jeremy Corbyn would see John McDonnell in the Treasury, but our economy has never before been run by someone who says he wants to overthrow capitalism or says Marx, Lenin and Trotsky are his most signicant influences.Jeremy Corbyn surrounds himself and works with people from the far-left fringes of politics and they could not be trusted to respect and uphold the independence of our civil service, the impartiality and fairness of our broadcasters or the freedom of the press.It is a disgrace that he and the people around him have allowed a party with a fine tradition of fighting for fairness and equality to be poisoned by racism against Jewish people.Under Corbyn, mainstream ideas are being replaced by views that are wildly out of step with the views of the general public. Extremism is rearing its way back into the public discourse in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.We encourage everyone who wants to support our country’s mainstream values in political and public le to join us. The left-wing grassroots body — set up just weeks after Corbyn won his  leadership contest — now has , members. It was based on the Syriza movement in Greece and Podemos in Spain, both of which  also fought against austerity measures.Cambridge graduate Lansman, , tried to run the party machine last year by mounting a failed bid to replace  out- going Iain McNicol as general secretary.

The partyaposs annual conference in Brighton is awash with rumours about who could succeed -year-old Mr Corbyn, but he says heaposs determined to stick it out in the top job. Speaking to the BBCaposs Andrew Marr, he said: Iaposm taking the party into the general election... to end austerity, to bring forward policies that bring about a better standard of living and better opportunities for people all across this country.

The move was seen by critics as being part of a broader bid to ensure a left-wing successor can take overand when Mr Corbyn steps down. Or , in Mr Corbynaposs words, an untoward accident happens with a bus. Those moves have included a rule change that will allow Labour officials to decide the acting leader in such a situation, rather than the deputy leader getting the post automatically.  On Friday night, the party’s ruling National Executive Committee allowed a motion from to abolish the post of deputy leader.  But in the wake of the ensuing furore the Labour leader struck a compromise deal to stop the row overshadowing the Labour conference He told the Sunday Mirror: “I told the national executive we need to review how the deputy leadership works and have an election process for two deputy leaders in the future which reflects ersity within our society so one would be a woman. “It was agreed overwhelmingly.” Mr Corbyn also defended his plan to go into a general election without saying whether he would campaign to remain in the European Union in the referendum he is promising. He said he would negotiate a new Brexit deal with Brussels and put that to a public vote against the option of staying in the EU.

I was five and my mum, Can, told me and my brother Tam we were going on holiday, but as she hugged us goodbye, she began to sob so much her whole body was shaking. I gripped my little brother’s hand as I watched the tiny village grow smaller in the rear view window. Like many Vietnamese children, we were adopted by an Australian family. It was a scary, lonely and confusing time, and I missed my birth family horribly. ‘When am I going home ’ I’d ask again and again in Vietnamese, but no one would answer me because they didn’t understand. I’d ask after my birth mother so often that my new parents told me she had died. I cried myself to sleep every night until I was eight or nine. My adoptive family were dysal and home le was tough. At , my adoptive mother died.    After that, I was going through my adoptive father’s filing cabinet and I found an old letter, with a Vietnamese postmark. I felt elated as I realised it was from my birth mum. Straight away, I wrote a long letter to the address she had given, explaining who I was and askingCan was alive. Soon after, I got a simple fax back, saying, ‘Mother still alive, very happy to hear from you.’ My heart soared as I read her words. For the next few years, I exchanged letters with her and was thrilled to finally have contact with her. But as time went on, the correspondence became overwhelming and she started to demand money. At only , it was far too much for me to take in and I stopped responding, tearing up the letters and trying to move on with my le.    It wasn’t until many years later that I felt ready to try contact again. It was , I was  and hadn’t seen my birth family for nearly  years. But I booked a flight to Vietnam and resolved to meet my mother. I tracked down a family friend in my home city, Can Tho. Within  minutes, my mum was on her way over, and I waited nervously for her arrival. I recognised her face immediately as she bounded towards me, sobbing. Bawling her eyes out, she looked just like she did when I left. I held her tight. ‘You came back,’ she kept repeating. Taking me to see the rest of my relatives in Phong Dien, the entire village turned up to welcome me home. Seeing their faces, fragmented memories of my early childhood in Vietnam came flooding back and I realised I couldn’t leave again.  I moved to Vietnam permanently, buying a house and inviting Can to live with me. I got to know the family members I’d left behind, and was even financially supporting many of them. I never questioned that this was my family. I had no reason to ever doubt it. I adopted my two beautul boys, Daniel and Sam in , but the cracks started to show. Mum began hassling me over money and when she became strangely jealous of my sons. So after four years of living with me, Mum moved out and we put some distance between us. Our relationship deteriorated until we no longer spoke. Fourteen years after myto Vietnam, I was working out at my local gym when my phone began to ring on repeat. I put my phone on silent and carried on, until I received a strange message: ‘Ho Thi Ich is your real mother’. As soon as I got home, my phone started to ring again. I knew something wasn’t right, so I handed it over to my cousin. When my cousin hung up, she was in shock and just said, ‘You’re not my cousin… and Can’s not your mum.’  My head was spinning – it didn’t make sense. I rang my aunt right away and bombarded her with questions, asking hershe ever saw Can pregnant with me. When my aunt said no, my cousin called Can and coaxed a confession, telling her I was going to do a DNA test. Finally, Can confessed. Forty-eight years earlier, she had taken me from my real birth parents. She was a friend of my real mother, Ho Thi Ich, who had fallen gravely ill during childbirth. Ho Thi Ich, a widow with two other children, had nearly died. Offering to help, Can had nursed me. But when Ho Thi Ich recovered and asked after her child, no one could tell her where she’d gone. Can had run away with me. I cried for three days — not because she wasn’t my mother, but because of the lies and deception. My entire world came crashing down. Everything I thought I knew was a lie. For the past  years, this woman had deceived me, and I was desperate to meet my real mum.

With children of a similar age, they would share their problems over dinner and celebrate special occasions together. So when Diane’s -year-old son Robert dropped out of uni, Nina was concerned too. She had known Robert since he was  and believed him to be a hard worker, as he was always taking on part-time jobs as a teen. By this time, Nina was running her own successful estate agency with  employees. She had worked hard to build up her business from scratch, and it was booming. ‘Robert was clever and reliable, so I offered him a job as a trainee letting agent,’ says Nina. ‘Diane was thrilled and Robert was so grateful – I even bought him a smart new suit, so he’d look the part.’ Nina took Robert under her wing and trained him up herself.    Robert called Nina his ‘second mum’, and he was also close to her husband Rob, regularly going on bike rides together at the weekend. Within a few years, Nina promoted Robert to lettings manager. Nina trusted him implicitly: he would be responsible for collecting money from renters and landlords, and delivering large sums of money to the bank. ‘I was proud of Robert for turning his le around,’ says Nina. ‘He had a great rapport with clients and was savvy with money, saving up for fancy holidays. aposHe also liked to go to betting shops and the races with his dad, but it wasn’t my place to judge how he spent his wages.’ But gradually Nina began to notice strange discrepancies in the company’s accounts. Although her agency was doing well and taking on new clients, profits stayed the same.    Her confused accountants investigated, but couldn’t find the cause and assured Nina that everything was in order. During this time, Robert got engaged to his pregnant girlfriend Rachael and began planning a huge wedding. He also bought two houses. Robert was living a comfortable le, regularly receiving packages at work as he bought the latest gadgets. Then, in , Nina was given devastating news: HM Revenue  Customs told her she owed £, in taxes. Nina was horried – she had never been in debt in her le, and none of her clients or landlords were missing any money. Her accountants had repeatedly looked into the company’s finances, but everything seemed to be in order. Nina asked her trusted employee Robert, who said it must be a mistake. Nina was given just three months to pay the bill. Terried of damaging her company’s reputation and risking her employees’ jobs, she quickly scrabbled the money together by remortgaging some properties she had invested in and dipping into her pension.  Desperate to get to the bottom of where the money was going, Nina hired an expensive firm of forensic accountants to investigate, a process that would take months as they went over the books with a fine-tooth comb. Meanwhile, Robert got married in a decadent country house hotel, and of course Nina and Robert were there to support the man they treated like a second son. It wasn’t until August , a year after HMRC had saddled her with the bill, that her forensic accountants finally got to the bottom of where the money had been going. Robert had been manipulating the system to swindle cash from Nina for years. Robert had been skimming a percentage from the rental and management fees and pocketing the cash. At first, Nina refused to believe it, telling the accountants that Robert was like family. She took Robert aside again for a private chat, but he denied any knowledge of where the missing money could be. Desperate for the truth, Nina and her husband Rob spent days going through CCTV footage from the office. They made an awful discovery, watching in horror as they saw Robert at his desk with huge wads of cash he had collected from tenants. He picked up a bundle of cash, kissed it, stuffed it into his bag and walked out of the office. Nina’s whole world fell apart.  ‘I couldn’t escape the image of him kissing the money and piling it into his suit pocket,’ she says. ‘The suit I lovingly bought him, enabling him to be smart and professional when representing my business. ‘I couldn’t forget the sight of him putting white envelopes full of my money into his lunch bag, and swinging the bag around when he was leaving for the day, knowing it was full of stolen cash.’ Nina and Rob realised what had been happening: Robert had been collecting rent from the tenants and giving them receipts, then paying the landlords the rent they were owed. But he hadn’t been taking all the money he collected to the bank, instead keeping a percentage to fund his opulent lestyle. It was a huge blow. ‘I grew my business from the little savings I had,’ Nina says. ‘I sacriced spending quality time with our four children, my elderly mother and family for holidays and days off, as I worked every hour possible.’ Immediately, Nina called a disciplinary meeting with Robert and confronted him.  Nina sobbed as she showed him the evidence, and he coldly admitted she had inadvertently paid for the wedding and the houses. Robert didn’t apologise or attempt to explain his actions, but instead had the cheek to ask Nina for a reference as she kicked him out. Straight away, Nina and Rob called the police and reported Robert for theft. When Nina told Diane, she broke down in tears and said, ‘It can’t be true.’ In October , police interviewed Robert, but he refused to answer questions. Desperate for justice, Nina and Rob paid £, of their own money to gather more evidence against Robert, hiring more forensic accountants and computer specialists. Investigators uncovered shocking new information: Robert had a serious gambling problem and had squandered £, in one month alone. Seven months later, police interviewed Robert once more, this time armed with evidence from Nina’s team of investigators, which suggested he had stolen more than £,, although Robert only admitted taking £,. ‘The personal betrayal has caused me enormous emotional damage,’ says Nina. ‘This experience has been devastating.

Hotel bosses at Les Orangers in the North African country are said to be holding people captive over unpaid bills from ailing travel firm Thomas Cook. Guests at the beach resort in the town of Hammamet, near Tunis, say security guards are keeping the gates shut while the hotel demands visitors pay extra money out of fear it wonapost be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook for holiday bookings. Guests are claiming they are being imprisoned at the resort - and staff are preventing people leaving for their flights. They are also claims that exits are being barricaded and tourists are being charged large fees - despite already having paid for their holiday. Thomas Cook - the worldaposs oldest travel firm - is in talks with the Government and potential investors about a last-minute rescue deal to fend off a collapse that would leave an estimated , UK holidaymakers stranded abroad.    Ryan Farmer, who was staying at the Les Orangers Hotel in Tunisia, told BBC Radio : It started at around pm there an announcement to call the people who are leaving today to go to the reception to pay this additional fee, obviously with this situation with Thomas Cook. They told a lady, who is over , to pay over £, and she had just come out of hospital. She had a fall over here. When asked why they were being made to pay again, Mr Farmer, from Leicestershire, added: Thomas Cook didnapost explain anything at all. Guests who are leaving today and tomorrow are getting the extra bill slipped under the door.    And obviously they are concerned and they come down and ask why and they are just being told to pay. The Thomas Cook rep is here as well and we are all trying to sort things out with the hotel but they are just not interested. From what we gathered, it has to do with the owner of the hotel. The owner and the staff locked the door, they donapost let anybody out and donapost let any coaches in until they are paid. Another guest Jonathan Fielding tweeted: Currently on holiday at Les Orangers in Tunisia.    Thomas Cook not paid hotel, the hotel duped an elderly lady into repaying her hotel bill - over £.k, and then barricaded the exits preventing those due to leave for flight this evening, physically preventing when they tried. Planes are waiting to fly Britons home in an airlt that would cost £million and be the biggest ever UK peacetime repatriationthe airline goes bust. Mr Farmer added: We have been up to the gates and there are four security guards holding the gates closed and theyaposre not allowing anybody leave. It frustrated for the people who are trying to get out and trying to get home. I am not leaving until Tuesday so itaposs a little bit dferent for us. We are just a little concerned aposare we gonna get out apos aposdo we have to move another hotel apos    The guards donapost say anything, just holding the gates. Thereaposs a gentleman from Ireland trying to talk to them and say aposlook we wanna go home, can you let us out apos They [the guards] just look at him and laugh and continue to hold the gates shut. They make no comments at all. He added that the hotel had turned off the WiFi and they couldnapost communicate out. Another guest David Astbury wrote on Facebook that the hotel would not accept electronic cash payment and aposa group of men arrived delivering a huge amount of cashapos. He explained: All sorts going on - no official information at all.  But a group of men arrived delivering a huge amount of cash - and the hotel would not accept electronic cash payment - and the people due to leave tonight were then permitted to leave the hotel. The money was presumably from Thomas Cook. The same drama may start up again tomorrow, but for now itaposs over. The British Consulate in Tunisia has reportedly been made aware of the situation at the hotel. Thomas Cook has called a meeting on Sunday morning of major shareholders and creditors in a bid to avoid going into administration. Les Orangers, situated in Hammamet, is described as: Offering a seasonal outdoor pool and a private beach area.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFrom the age of three, Jeneen Schofield’s only child made the same Christmas and birthday wish: “I want to be a girl.” While family snaps show the tot in a Liverpool football kit, Jeneen says her toddler, born a boy, soon sensed he should be living le as a girl. And last year, at the age of seven, her wish came true when her name was officially changed by deed poll – to Luna. She started wearing a skirt to school and got a new passport too as one of Britain’s youngest transgender children. Today her proud mum opens her heart on the le-changing events and defies critics who believe her decision to let Luna choose her gender was premature.    NHS worker Jeneen, , tells of the moment Luna, now eight, was “set free” and talks of her “grieving process” as she let her little boy go. The mum says: “Luna was asking when she could be a girl soon after her third birthday. I brushed it off as a phase and told her to stop being silly. “But she kept asking. My family felt she was too young to make the decision to be a girl, but I didn’t want to tell her how she felt and knew this wasn’t going away.” Luna’s story comes as figures show the number of gender dysphoria children in Britain doubled in the past year. Referrals to England’s only specialist clinic for transgender children have risen nearly  per cent in four years.    Last year , children were referred to the Leeds-based Gender Identity Development Service, where Luna visits. Jeneen tells how Luna always shunned “football stuff”, preferring to play with dolls and dress-up. At five she was allowed to “socially transition”. Jeneen adds: “Before then she’d worn princess dresses to the local shop with me, or at home. On her fth birthday she spent the day at Disneyland Paris in a dress. She couldn’t have been happier. “At the top of every Christmas and birthday wishlist was to be a girl. It was hard to accept what I was seeing.” Luna had only been at school a few weeks when Jeneen asked to speak to her teacher. She explains: “It was World Book Day. I explained Luna wanted to go as Alice in Wonderland and I askedshe thought there might be more to this. The teacher agreed, saying she noticed Luna always being the mum or sister when kids played dressing-up. “Suddenly I was so scared about how it might cause problems for her. I sat in my car and cried my heart out. I didn’t really know what trans meant. For weeks I was petried Luna would have a loveless le full of people hating her.”  But Jeneen says YouTube videos of parents of trans kids talking about their situation – plus resources downloaded from Mermaids, the trans-support charity – helped her realise Luna could find happiness. She adds: “The more research, the more I realised transitioning didn’t mean the end. Luna could have a happy le and find love as a girl.” But this month NHS psychologists said children are allowed to live as the opposite sex too soon. They say letting kids as young as six “socially transition” could do long-term harm by forcing them to choose too early. Two top doctors also advised caution. Social psychologist Dr David Canter said: “No one should be assigned the label transgender before puberty. If the child is unhappy then the reasons should be explored without assigning labels.” Consultant psychiatrist and TV doc Raj Persaud added: “A careful medical assessment is needed to understand what is going on. Only then can decisions be reached.” But single mum Jeneen insists it would have been wrong to let Luna live a lie. And she stresses: “One thing I was sure of was how I’d certainly never encouraged Luna to be a girl.” In  Jeneen took Luna to Liverpool Pride, where Mermaids had a stall. They met a family with a trans child a year older than Luna.  Jeneen recalls: “She had started to wear girls’ clothes and seemed so happy. I asked Lunashe wanted some normal girls’ clothes, rather than princess dresses, and she was so excited.” So she took Luna to Primark where they bought three dresses, a pair of pink jeans and some bobbles. “Seeing her spinning around in the changing rooms in her new clothes was heart-melting, like she’d been set free,” Jeneen says. “The moment we got home Luna emptied her wardrobe of all the boys’ clothes, put them into bin bags and put her new clothes up with pride.” Days later Jeneen told her mum that Luna would be wearing girls’ clothes. She says: “We had an explosive argument, Mum telling me, ‘I can’t take her out in girls’ clothes’! I screamed back saying she had to be more understanding and supportive. “Mum called back later saying how sorry she was, how she loved us, but she was so scared. I explained I was more scared than anyone, but I couldn’t help Luna on my own. “And with the head’s blessing at the start of Luna’s second year at school, she proudly wore a girl’s unorm. “Everyone was so accepting. Other kids would ask why she was in a dress, and she’d reply, ‘Because it makes me happy’, and that was it. “The sense of relief when she came home that first day with a smile on her face was overwhelming.”  Then came the issue of a name. After trying Alice for a week, she switched to Luna – a nod to the fact she and Jeneen look for the moon at night to make a wish before bedtime.The process hasn’t been easy though and Jeneen admits “grieving” as Facebook ‘time hop’ photos would pop up of Luna as a baby – “making me feel like I’d lost my old child”.But she stresses: “I explained how I felt to friends not in the trans community. They told me I should be grateful to have a child. “It’s a complex emotion as a parent of a trans child. Last thing I wanted was to cause offence to any parent who has lost a child because of an accident or illness.” After being a nurse for  years, Jeneen started a course in therapy and it helped her come to terms with their new le. This, plus being part of an invaluable Mermaids network in Liverpool, gave her the confidence and strength to handle “horric” online comments. She adds: “I stopped reading comments saying how the parents should be killed or needed sectioning. This was about Luna’s happiness.

Amy Rennie, , tragically lost her baby at ten and a half weeks. The teenager, who praised the work of midwives at Derrord Hospital, Plymouth, hit out at the drunks and drug users who cause delays in the emergency department. Derrord has said it is incredibly sorry for Amyaposs loss and the long wait that she faced, Plymouth Live reports. Thereaposs no suggestion the  hour wait contributed to the loss of Amyaposs baby. The AE department - which is about to get a £million overhaul in a bid to try to keep up with rising demand - treats over  people a day.    Amy said: I donapost want anyone  to go through what I went through that day. Staff were dealing with people who were drunk or on drugs first and it was just horrible.  I know it canapost have been just me thataposs gone through something like this. So many people that night were moaning because it took hours to be seen. Amy, who has a one-year-old son, said she went to hospital on September  after she began bleeding. After several hours waiting she says a doctor entered the waiting area and advised patients that the waiting time was around seven hours. At the time I questioned it, Amy told Plymouth Live. She said: I asked the receptionist whether it was still a seven hour wait for me given the circumstances, and she then advised me that there were only two people in front of me, and then I could be seen. Amy provided a urine sample then waited a few hours longer before giving a blood sample, she said.    Staff told me that my bloods were normal, which relieved me at bit, she said. I wasnapost panicking as much then. I explained to the nurse that I was still bleeding heavily, and she reassured me that it was probably nothing to worry about. Amy said it was not until .am the following day when, still waiting for a scan, staff told her she would be seen after an .am changeover. She was then taken to the Meavy Ward and seen by a doctor at about am, she said. Amy said: By this point, I hadnapost slept all night, I hadnapost eaten, and up until now Iaposd kept being shoved into the waiting room, so I was just fed up. A check of her cervix also came back normal but it was not until pm that Amy was sent for a scan, she said.  By this point Iaposd been there for so long, I just felt like crying, she said. I was hungry, frustrated, stressed, and still didnapost know why I was experiencing this bleeding. When I got to the scan room they asked me another batch of questions, and then I was scanned by a midwe called Pam, who I canapost thank enough, she was very supportive. She scanned me, and even used a camera, before telling me that my baby was there, but with no heartbeat. Amy ed a week later and was sent home with little more than a scan photo. The whole thing from start to finish was just the most horrible experience Iaposve ever been through, she said. In the days that followed, I was in such a state, I couldnapost even look after my son for a few days Iaposve still not been told what caused my miscarriage, and I keep feeling like itaposs my fault, even though I know itaposs not.

He could literally fit in the palm of my hand but he was a fighter and so I named him Arlo, which means warrior. “I could see through his skin and see the blood going round his little body and count his ribs.” Shopworker Emma was hysterical when her waters broke at  weeks. Doctors warned her to “prepare for the worst” as they believed her son was too premature to survive.  She said: “They kept referring to the baby as a foetus because it was so early in my pregnancy. I told them to stop calling him that as he was my baby – he was my son. “But the medical staff explained that babies aren’t considered viable until  weeks, when it’s possible for them to survive.” Arlo suffered a further blow when the umbilical cord supplying his oxygen moved out of place. Emma was rushed into theatre for an emergency Caesarean and, minutes later, Arlo was taken away to intensive care, wrapped in a plastic bag. Emma said: “It was to keep his temperature stable, and whenever it dropped they wrapped him in bubble wrap to stabilise it. “It looked weird but I would have done anything to keep my little boy alive.”  Things took another turn for the worse when X-rays showed Arlo’s bloated tummy was hiding a severe inflammation. Emma said: “The surgeon came to see us and said that there was a chance Arlo wouldn’t make it through the night. “My legs went from under me. I was so scared I couldn’t talk. I was allowed to kiss Arlo before he was taken for surgery. That kiss was the first time I’d been able to touch him. I just hoped it wasn’t the last.” During surgery to remove % of Arlo’s bowel he lost % of his blood and needed a transfusion. Nurses used Manuka honey to help heal his wound.

I did try to explain this to the security guard but he still wouldnapost let us in. He said my heels werenapost high enough, that I had to wear high heels.It makes me feel really uncomfortable to be told I have to wear certain clothes or look a certain way.    She added: You donapost always want to wear high heels when youaposre just going out to have fun with friends. You can look smart without having to wear high heels. It can make you feel vulnerable to have to wear a short skirt and high heels. You often end up getting attention from men that you just donapost want. People look at you in a certain way when you dress like that. However, the club has denied this and said flat shoes and designer trainers were allowed.   Patrycja complained over Instagram and said she received the following response: We are sorry to hear you felt discriminated towards.  prides itself on being erse in all ways.We do and have allowed female clients to enter the club in smart flat shoes and smart designer trainers suited to their outfit. We do have a dress code which our door staff must adhere to, however, it does not state females must be dressed provocatively in any way. Our shoe policy is smart and everyone has their own personal perspective of this. But Patrycja doesnapost think this information has been passed on to the doorstaff. My one friend was wearing high heels and he said she could go in but the other was wearing high heels with black tights and he said she couldnapost. We explained that it was cold so why shouldnapost she wear tights to go out  He said he didnapost want to have to explain why. It made us feel embarrassed because they did it in front of other people in the queue. They let in a group of five women go in front of us but we couldnapost go in because we didnapost have that certain look. Some men started laughing at us.

The -square mile island of Ikaria claims to have more nonaganerians than any other place on the planet. Research suggests one in three inhabitants of the picturesque island reach the age of .  So itaposs no surprise that researchers have been trying to decode the secret to the elderly islandersapos longevity - finding clues in their Mediterranean diets, midday naps and sex well into their vintage years.    Anthropologists have long pointed to fresh, healthy Mediterranean diets rich in fish and olive oil as an elixir of long-le. The so-called blue zone describes the regions dotted around the world where populations are thought to live the longest. Along with Ikaria, in the Aegean Sea, anthropologists have identied the worldaposs blue zones to include: the Japanese island of Okinawa, claimed to be home to the worldaposs longest-lived women, Costa Ricaaposs Nicoya Pensinsula where there were lower than normal rates of middle-aged mortality, and Italian tourism beautyspot Sardinia. Backed by National Geographic, bestselling author and longevity Dan Buettner and his research team of demographics experts have in recent years explored blue zones including Ikaria in hopes of unlocking their secrets to long le.   He wrote in the New York Times in  of his visit to the island - noting how previous claims of long-living populations were often debunked - but Ikariaaposs reputation held steadfast.Researchers found record-keeping in some villages storied for localaposs longevity meant many people didnapost actually know their own ages. Whataposs more, some beauty-spots discovered that reputations for longevity drew tourism. But researchers in Greece found solid documentation to back Ikariaaposs claims of a long-living population. They discovered locals reached the age of  at two-and-a-half times the rate Americans do.    Successive studies have found the islandaposs villagers were in comparatively better health, and living longer before they were beset with cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia and depression. A University of Athens School of Medicine study analysed the diet of hundreds of Ikarians, finding they consumed plenty of beans and fish - and ate meat only about five times a month. The Ikaria Study also found the elderly islanders had a diet low in refined sugar but high in olive oil. They noted the islanders consumed two to three cups of coffee and two to four glasses of wine a day. Mr Buettneraposs own research teamaposs interviews found islanders enjoying diets low in heart disease-inducing saturated fats found in meat and dairy, and high in antioxidant-rich and pesticide-free greens grown in their own gardens.

I give all credit to them.”Team Xtreme won  medals at last year’s World Championships and recently received £ from WL Gore towards the cost of taking his squad to Greece for next year’s event in the hope of scooping more silverware.“That helps us get new pads, new mats and a discount off travel,” Cavanagh said.“A lot of families here don’t have a lot of money and we don’t get much funding at all.“We are grateful for all the support we get from fundraisers and companies like WL Gore.“It’s great for the kids to get out there and represent their country, without that I don’t know what half of them would be doing. vw, px\"  “There was nothing here for kids to do in Charleston but I started this with three bags and some pads out the back of my car, it’s just got bigger and the kids really needed this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7776e9b37d24.50421766-e1568121136325.jpg ","title":"dundee united cant allow a bump in the road to puncture championship tilt","story":"Like many other title challengers in Scotland’s second-tier in recent years, Dundee United have now had their first of what may be a few bumps in the road this season.The Championship can be unforgiving and is often dubbed Scotland’s toughest ision.Eventual-champions in seasons in the not-so-distant past like Rangers, Hibs and St Mirren have toiled on their road back to the Premiership.Even last term’s winners Ross County had to fight off the likes of United and Inverness going into the final few matches of  .However, United must take heart that, despite a few challenges along the way, all those teams eventually prevailed.For now, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson is labelling their - defeat at Ayr United last weekend a ‘blip’.And, on the face of it right now, he is correct in that assessment as the Terrors remain top of the pile alongside the Honest Men.However, what the Terrors must be a wary of is that little blip getting bigger and bigger and, much like a little bump in a tyre, bursting.And another punctured attempt at promotion is not what United need after three failed efforts.A win over Arbroath today would jump-start their campaign.On the other hand, defeat at Tannadice could see United fall off the Championships summit and leave them chasing others.What’s dferent this time to seasons gone by is they have time and ample resources on their side.The Terrors never kicked into gear at Somerset Park last time out and maybe a change of tack is something Robbie will be considering – across all areas of the pitch.It has been much-documented that United are short at the back. With only Mark Reynolds a stick-on starter, there are big decisions to be made over the fitness of new boy Troy Brown or whether to opt for Paul Watson or midfielder Calum Butcher against the Red Lichties.Going for the latter in central defence would likely see Ian Harkes come into the midfield.And the American’s inclusion would be a welcome one, in my opinion.His impact in the derby win over Dundee was clear, not only with his goal but overall play.Up top, Louis Appere has impressed but when Nicky Clark came on at Ayr he looked lively and is a proven scorer at this level.Much to ponder as United look to remove the spoke from their wheel and get back on the title charge."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d84ef8db47184.83854957-770x564.jpg ","title":"jamie ness touch and go for dee clash in greenock","story":"Dundee are sweating over the fitness of Jamie Ness ahead of today’s trip to face Morton.The experienced midfielder is “touch and go” according to Dark Blues boss James McPake for the Championship clash at Cappielow.The -year-old former Rangers and Stoke City man picked up an ankle injury against Cove Rangers in the Betfred Cup before exacerbating that issue against Elgin City in the Challenge Cup a fortnight ago.And gaffer James admits it is still a niggling problem for Ness.“Jamie Ness is still touch and go. Again it’s a niggling thing,” he said.“It goes back to that tackle up at Cove and then the tackle the other week.“It’s a bit of bone bruising and swelling in his ankle that we’re doing our best to get rid of and get him going at it.”Despite that bad news, James was quick to make the point that the rest of his squad are available and is pleased with the options at his disposal. vw, px\"  He added: “Everybody  is fine.“There’s strength in depth, that was a big thing we needed to do.“You need that because we’ll get injuries and suspensions, loss of form and times where you might need to change the team for your opponent.“We’ve got players here that give us a good mixture. For example, Kane Hemmings sat there with Andrew Nelson last Saturday and what a luxury that is to have that quality on the bench.“It’s important and throughout the season everyone will be needed.”Gaffer James was particularly happy with namesake Josh McPake’s performance in the - win over Alloa last week and has also put any doubts over his fitness to bed.He said: “Josh McPake has trained and he’s fine.“He was good against Alloa, we knew bringing him to the club what qualities he had.“I’ve seen a lot of him over the years, mainly because he pops into my head quickly because he has the same surname.“You take an interest in him but he was great, very direct and had loads of attempts on goal.“The front three, in particular, were really good in the first half of that game. They created loads of chances and got the ball into the box.“Josh has got that where he can go at people. He sets up the second goal and I was happy with him.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee seek back to back wins as united aim to bounce back","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan askDundee can make it two wins in a row as they travel to Morton and will United come back from defeat at Ayr  Elsewhere, former Tangerines boss Craig Levein is feeling the heat.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d838b27dd6cb1.95145839-752x564.jpg ","title":"the giddy goose excellent service in a pretty place","story":"Having called in for drinks with my friends one day, we were enticed to sample the food on offer too.There is a reasonably sized menu offering all sorts of food from grazerto pasta, via burgers, sandwiches and dogs, steak plates and pizza. There’s also a fair range of vegan options.Five girls choosing food can take a little bit of time, but we did quite well and quickly decided to skip the starters and focus on the main courses.Our order was for a frankfurt calzone , chorizo and meatball tagliatelle , beef lasagna £., a Giddy Goose house burger , a pulled ham hock panzerottiand a portion of fries for the table . Nope, I’d no idea what a panzerotti was either, but the menu said it was a deep fried calzone style pizza and “ you fancy something new then be sure to pick one”. Being an obedient girl, that’s just what I did.I was delighted that when I asked that they hold off a little on the brieas it’s not my favourite cheese, I was offered to change the cheese to something . I chose mozzarella. A nice touch. vw, px\"  We also sniggered at our burger-ordering friend who asked for just a burger on a roll. Asking for clarity the server said, so no cheese or salad  Oh, I’ll have the salad, she said . . . and some coleslaw. So basically her “just plain burger”, which she asked to be well done, was only missing the cheese – I think there’s an easier way to ask!We ordered some drinks and a bottle of wine and some water for the table and sat back to wait.There is what looked like a nice seating area outside, though inside it’s almost like a garden, too, with lots of wooden trellis- type structures with green leafy plants and nice lights dotted about the place. vw, px\"  Beside the bar there’s a partially enclosed area they called Bohemian that looked like it would be a good spot to bookyou were a larger party. There’s also a room along from the bar and a downstairs area that had a privateon when we were in.Seats are a mixture of leather and cloth, with attractive bright cushions. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere.We didn’t seem to wait very long for our food as we were busy chatting, though our server apologised that there had been a delay when he brought the plates over.All the dishes were well presented.The meatballs looked a little overdone and, when pressed, my friend agreed they were quite dry.We persuaded her to ask for more sauce and the plate was taken away to be replaced by a whole freshly-cooked plate. vw, px\"  More sauce would have sufficed, but it was nice to see the restaurant strive to make things right.The lasagna was a good-sized portion, with clearly defined layers. My friend said it was enjoyable, but she prefers her Italian pasta with a bit more sauce.The oz burger was well done, as requested, and served with fries, salad and relish. It was a big plateful and very tasty.The calzone was served with salad and had a lot of filling – including sweetcorn, so I’d avoid it – but the recipient enjoyed it. My panzerotti looked like a soft calzone – I’d expected it to be crispy as it was fried, but it was quite doughy. The filling was delicious and I’d forgotten how nice ham hock tastes, so I ate the insides with my fries and salad and left some of the dough. I probably wouldn’t have it again but other people would love it, so don’t be put off.I’d go back here again for food, or even just drinks."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photos-show-royal-visit-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-evening-times-takes-look-back-glasgow-39-s-political-past","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"old-albion-motors-site-39-s-new-lease-life-celebrated-glasgow-39-s-doors-open-day","story":"PETER Burt can still remember his job interview at Albion Motors in Scotstoun, more than  years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-take-look-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"govan-loyalist-band-refuses-withdraw-marches-request-glasgow-city-council","story":"GLASGOWCity Council havesaid they deeply regret the disruption which will be caused to the community in Govan after a loyalist flute band refused to withdraw a request to march through the area on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-cathedral-host-poignant-bell-ringing-service-bereaved-parents","story":"A MEMORIAL service will be held tomorrow at Glasgow Cathedral for parents who have suffered the loss of a baby."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-39-woke-blind-39-raises-30-000-charity","story":"A -year-old woman who woke up blind has put her best foot forward to raise nearly pound, for Talking Books for the blind."},{"url":null,"title":"spend-weekend-cells-part-glasgow-doors-open-day","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS courts are giving the public a look behind the scenes this weekend as part of the  Doors Open Day event."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-group-hails-39-hugely-successful-39-community-clean-up","story":"UPSTREAM Battle has finished its hugely successful week of action today after a iety of events across the city."},{"url":null,"title":"cake-store-owners-shaken-receiving-homophobic-letter-customer","story":"We appreciate some people will find the language in this article offensive.

Machar Academy there were eight incidents with vandals smashing six windows, damaging a car park light and breaking a changing room door between July  and August .Three seats and a hairdryer were damaged at Lochside Academy on August  and August .The fire alarm was set off three times in the games changing rooms and science block at Northfield Academy on August . vw, px\"  There were

times this summer, compared with six in .There were fires at Mintlaw Academy, St Combs Primary School, the Anna Ritchie School and Clerkhill Primary School in Peterhead.An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman described the vandalism as “reckless” and said the cost of repairs erted local authority funding away from other services.He said: “It is unfortunate that council taxpayers’ money will have to be spent on repairing reckless acts of vandalism to our schools over the summer holidays.“We are working closely with Police Scotland in resolving these crimes and are making the necessary repairs

think about the consequences of their actions.”Local councillor Ross Grant said: “Any vandalism is to be condemned but it is truly dreadful when our places of learning are being targeted in this

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

I would not want to send my children through that woods lit or unlit at night and would not want to go there alone as a single person in this day and age.During the meeting, an agent for developer Cala said they could only build a footpath to the northernedge of the site where it meets land owned by Muirfield Grove residents.He said: ldquoResidents of Muirfield Grove have refused to engage with us to allow us to usethe site.ldquoIt is up to East Lothian Council to use statutory powers to developa path.However, Mr Findlay asked: ldquoAre we really in the business of enforcing residents to give up the right to their own land Martin White, from Gullane Area Community Council, urged councillors to invite the developer to take another look at the access paths from the hew housing.He said: ldquoNo path that goes by a wood, evenit is lit, is a safe path to school.ldquoWe believe the plans need more work to be done on them it is not that thorough, it is not ready and it needs to be sent back.However, Councillor Lachlan Bruce said he did not believe the path posed a danger to children.He said: ldquoI do not understand why walking by the wood would be dangerous. I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of land owned by Muirfield Grove residents for approval before building begins.It also added an additional condition asking for a Construction Method Statement to be submitted prior to work beginning amid concerns about access to the site which is through a narrow C-class road and reports of heavy construction vehicles parking off site.A third additional condition, addressing the local authorityrsquos recent pledge to take action against a climate emergency, called for a report on actions taken to reduce carbon emissions on the site to be submitted.Following the meeting, Councillor Findlay, who was the sole member to vote against approving the plans, said: ldquoIam very disappointed with the decision of the planning committee in approving Calarsquos application for detailed planning permission for Saltcoats Field despite the fact that, in my opinion, it falls far short of fulfilling Policy T of the Local Development Plan  in terms of connectivity to the rest of the village.ldquoI am also disappointed that it did not approve of my proposed amendment to delay permission until connectivity issues have been sorted out as, at present, the two proposed pedestrian cycle routes either go over land owned by Gullane residents who have not given their permission to use or via the much longer route through Millennium Wood which is not a safe route to school or for

Similar ventures are in operation at other senior football clubs in Scotland. These rough arenas offered respite from a grimy and perilous working week and the echoes of precious hours spent in them can defer the thickening mists of dementia.The football players and the clubs whose colours they wore carried the pride of entire working class communities: no one owned them on these terraces and the princes and magicians they came to watch were neighbours or the sons of neighbours.Few of these grounds now exist in their original state and even fewer that are as old as Cltonhill. Albion Rovers have existed since , the last  of this stretch in this place. A collection of black and white photographs taken of Cltonhill and the supporters who bring it to le every two weeks forms the centrepiece of an exhibition at Coatbridgersquos splendid Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Le to mark Albion Roversrsquo residency at the stadium.A Game of Two Halves features the mesmeric and evocative work of the award-winning photographer, Iain McLean who was reared on the streets that surround this little park and who re-discovered his childhood love for the club while making them. McLean uses the shting light of grey skies to capture the simple act of attending a football match and to make them seem timeless. Some of these images could have been taken  or  years ago and capture the enduring simplicity of footballrsquos appeal. His pictures are accompanied by a short film by the documentary-maker Wilma Smith, who spent an afternoon recording the ebb and flow of a game through the terracing shouts of the supporters.Albion Rovers is a club whose name suggests inclusivity and where all that is tribal must depart. Other clubs across the UK have lsquoAlbionrsquo or lsquoRoversrsquo attached to their place-names but none have both together. Nor is there any such thing as a lsquoWanderers Unitedrsquo and so Albion Rovers is something unique in British senior football: its name is not narrowed by geographical boundary or city limits, yet few other clubs are embedded in the community that formed them more than this one.Every picture in McLeanrsquos Cltonhill portfolio tells a story that built this year towards something unforeseen and operatic. Towards the end of season   Albion Roversrsquo faced the biggest existential threat of its -year existence as it performed a danse macabre for its tormented supporters with the spectre of relegation from League Two. It escaped this fate with the assistance of a benign intervention as the careless whish of an administratorrsquos pen and the improper registration of an opposition player bequeathed the club three unlikely points and an advantage that was to prove priceless.Ronnie Boyd who, until recently, was Albion Rovers chairman recalls this uncertainty with a chill. ldquoItrsquos vital for Coatbridge that Albion Rovers retains its senior status. If we had dropped down into the leagues below it wouldnrsquot have been the end of us but it would have dealt a serious blow to our confidence and to the sense of pride that the community retains for this club.Rovers attract a mere  or so supporters at home games and keeping the lights on and the wolves from the door is a week-to-week challenge. ldquoThe club is run on a firm financial footing, says Boyd ldquobut nor are we carrying any padding. We are never more than something like a floodlight failure away from a financial crisis and must rely on the services of a team of volunteers who donate several hours each week to the cause of keeping this club afloat and among Scotlandrsquos senior leagues. Them and our sponsors who also go above and beyond.ldquoMany people in Coatbridge refer to us as their lsquosecond clubrsquo which causes some angst amongst the board. The eternal challenge, I suppose, is to persuade some of them to make us their lsquofirstrsquo club. I donrsquot really resent this. There are many competing attractions and lots of other small clubs find themselves in our position. Yet, the task the club faces in this is much more daunting than most other small, community clubs which strive for the right to co-exist with giants. Four Scottish Premier League clubs lie within a dozen miles of Coatbridge, including the two biggest of all: Celtic and Rangers. Celtic Park lies less than nine miles away and each week coachloads of its supporters leave the town which is still steeped in its Irish Catholic heritage.Occasionally, when a sparsely-populated terrace is captured on camera a wise-cracking, metropolitan commentator will smirk about naming the crowd as well as the teams. There are  season-ticket holders at Cltonhill and Ronnie Boyd reckons he could probably name them all. Part of this is also due to the fact that Coatbridge possesses family roots that run through several generations and that this is one of those neighbourhoods where no one can remain a stranger for long. But itrsquos also due to this being one of the few senior football grounds where the chairman and his board are often to be seen personally greeting supporters at the entrance and thanking them for their continued support at a time when the directors of other clubs are obsequiously dispensing sauvignon to small tycoons.Along the M, meanwhile, Rangers, who were put into liquidation in  for over-reaching itself faced criticism from its own supporters for charging stf prices for their games in the Europa League. Celtic, the richest sporting organisation in Scotland, couldnrsquot bring itself to pay its lowest-paid workers the National Living Wage and when it was shamed into doing so the directors first removed the annual staff bonuses. Yet here is Albion Rovers, their poorest and most humble cousins treating its own few supporters like royalty. This seems to be appreciated and theythe love with interest. One of Iain MacLeanrsquos most vivid images is of volunteers fighting a losing battle trying to sweep mounds of snow from Cltonhillrsquos playing surface for a Scottish Cup tie against St Johnstone in January last year.McLean said: ldquoWhen the St Johnstone fans turned up and realised there was a risk to the game they got on the pitch with the rest of us to clear the snow. The spirit of this place is infectious and gets under your finger-nails. In my recent experience any who turn up here for the first time are captivated and form a deep attachment to Albion Rovers and to Cltonhill.Another is taken during a particularly dispiriting - home defeat to Peterhead last year. On the condensation of a Perspex home dugout a supporter has written in perfect mirror text ldquoSCORE PLEASE, a polite request which where might have been a profane demand.At the start of this season Bury FC, twice winners of Englandrsquos FA Cup and a founder member of the English football league shut its doors after  years of existence. The faces of three generations of its supporters were crumpled in grief as they began to realise that the pride of their northern, working class community was being thrown out of a league they had helped form. Not far away from Bury is Bolton Wanderers, the club of mighty Nat Lofthouse, the Lion of Vienna and which remains locked in a mortal struggle for its own existence. Financial analysts have predicted that several other English Football clubs are just one more breached overdraft away from perdition. These clubs are also hemmed in by an assortment of the richest football teams in Europe but not a scrap from the tables of these most egregiously capitalist enterprises is permitted to nourish its distressed old neighbours. Albion Rovers meanwhile is kept alive by the endeavours by a small volunteer corps of fans and directors who provide graft and services for free. The stadium sponsor is local firm Reigart Demolition and a flotilla of other sponsors gathers each season to ensure that the bills are paid and the part-time players and coaching staff receive some form of remuneration.Albion Rovers may now be eking out a twilight existence but without dreams football is reduced and this old club still retains some of its own. In  they reached the Scottish Cup final before being defeated by Kilmarnock in a - classic in front of , spectators at Hampden. Cltonhillrsquos record attendance of , against Rangers in  will stand for all time.This was where Jock Stein, the greatest club manager in Britain, played for a few years in the early s. In the last few years the club has established a Hall of Fame that now has seven members, including Tony Green who left Coatbridge in  to join Blackpool for pound,. Green also adorns Blackpoolrsquos Hall of Fame as well as Newcastle Unitedrsquos.More recently, in the mid-s Bernie Slaven left to join Middlesbrough where he too became a household name. Despite scoring more than  goals for Albion Rovers all the top Scottish clubs disdained him for his humble surroundings and were subsequently made to look foolish.Turning up occasional pearls such as these and selling them on to larger Scottish and English outfits traditionally provided sustenance to prudently-run smaller clubs. Now, the big clubs have lsquoacademiesrsquo which they use like footballrsquos equivalent of a scallop dredger, trawling the old feeding grounds and sparking dreams in hundreds of working class households before tossing the overwhelming majority overboard in the years to come in the worldrsquos most ruthless pruning exercise. By then, many are ruined by the brief excess of their associations with the big clubs, a time during which they could have developed better habits at clubs like Albion Rovers.Ronnie Boyd says the current board of directors are determined to ensure that they never again risk being demoted to the lower leagues and is hoping that the exhibition at the Summerlee Museum will renew local interest. Next weekend, between September  and September , the museum will host a Celebrate Albion Rovers weekend to commemorate  years of the club at Cltonhill. This stadium was also the home of speedway and greyhound racing, those other two great pastimes of the British working man and these will be celebrated with classic films and an exhibition of memorabilia from those blue remembered days.The silence of an empty football stadium at repose, even one as gnarly as Cltonhill, is like a cathedral. For a football-mad supporter like me, who would have given everything to have played just one half of a game at this level, these places are mesmerising.Ronnie Boyd still has the keys to Cltonhill and, sensing my expectation, invites me for a guided tour of the old ground. After unlocking the front gates he leads me up into the dressing-rooms and through the warren of rooms and passages that lead out to the main stand and the pitch below. The hospitality area is all tombola-stall decent and the wooden seats in the stand are still shiny in the new seasonrsquos red, yellow and black paint. Only one terrace is in use but the club has resisted the urge to pull down the other two which have long since been rendered obsolete by health and safety regulations. Thus, they remain largely as they were: monuments to old heroes and immortal deeds and still capable of stirring some echoes even as the light begins to fade in old eyes.A Game of  Halvesis running until October .

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"cameron-onslaught-leaves-former-pm-looking-cursed","story":"The Daily After Buckingham Palace said Cameronrsquos comments had caused lsquoan amount of displeasurersquo, Alan Cochrane says they were a colossal error. ldquoMr Cameron is in the dock of public opinion for an appalling lack of judgment, not to mention a clear breach of royal protocol, when he claimed hersquod asked the Queen to help defeat the nationalists, whom he feared were winning, he says.However he queries whether her comments would ever have reached the public but for Jim Lawson on the Daily Record who reported them and claims they came from a chance question to a member of the public who had spoken with the Queen.In the same paper, Michael Deacon reviews an unfortunate slip by Mr Cameron on TVrsquos This Morning.

It comes against new legislation requiring planning authorities to ensure decent play areas and improved access to play facilities is encouraged in new developments.Among the councils taking steps to rethink the signage is North Lanarkshire, birthplace to illustrious football talents such as Sir Matt Busby, Jock Stein, Davie Cooper and Jock lsquoTigerrsquo Shaw, who grew up honing their skills in the streets around their homes.The council has now published a survey asking residents for their views on the proposal to withdraw all lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs from communities across the district unless there are an obvious health and safety reasons for them to be retained.The signs are set to be removed from areas other than car parks and roads by next May.A North Lanarkshire Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council encourages children and young people to be active and have a healthy lestyle, and the proposal to remove these signs opens up more opportunities for children to play outdoors in their neighbourhoods.The move to rip down the signs is being seen as a step back to times when children were actively encouraged to play in the streets around their home, with hopes it can raise exercise levels, help in the battle against childhood obesity and improve young peoplersquos ball skills.Countless lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs cropped up in housing estates across the country in the s mainly in response to rising numbers of households becoming car owners.Rather than protecting children from vehicles, the signs were mainly devised to prevent the damage a stray football, cricket or tennis ball could cause to a windscreen.Although not legally enforceable, they acted as a deterrent to children and their parents, driving them indoors just as childrenrsquos television and electronic games became more accessible.Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum welcomed the move to rethink the signs and called for a societal sht in how childrenrsquos outdoor play is perceived.ldquoIn some cases, itrsquos concern over the noise children make when they play that has been the triggering factor for these signs cropping up. Thatrsquos le, we have to live with children laughing, shouting.ldquoIt might be a bit of a disturbance, however, itrsquos important that they have space which allows them to have unstructured play.ldquoIf thatrsquos impossible then there must be safe routes and paths to spaces which can offer these facilities.ldquoBy not providing those, you are storing up problems for the future. Children go home, sit in bedrooms playing their video games and donrsquot get the exercise they need. A lot of people are very intolerant, he added. ldquoA societal change has to take place.Aberdeen City Council became the first city authority in Scotland to remove the killjoy signs four years ago.Former Scotland striker Denis Law took up the councilrsquos offer to begin the process, and said at the time: ldquoYou need to get young people out playing ndash the streets were where we learned our trade.ldquoOne post was a lamppost, the other was a drainpipe or a jacket. There were no signs up to say no ball games.It was hoped that more councils would follow but in many cases, the signs have remained in place.Marguerite Hunter Blair, CEO of Play Scotland, said planning legislation introduced in July has sparked new play strategies and a sht towards removing obstacles to childrenrsquos playtime.ldquoTherersquos a recognition that therersquos no legal backing to these signs, however, they create a culture of children not being allowed to play or be visible in public and contribute to this culture of sedentary behaviour.ldquoParents donrsquot want their children to get into trouble, so they donrsquot encourage them to play ball games.ldquoWhile we do have to recognise that in some places the signs may be appropriate, in others, they are unnecessary and go against a lot of what councils are attempting to do to promote outdoor health and wellbeing.ldquoMore positive signage to encourage play is needed, or no signage at all.The PlanningAct  includes a section requiring councils to produce a sufficiency of play audit in planning reports to ensure there is adequate access to play opportunities.However, itrsquos thought changes to housing stock ownership and decades of lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs being in place has meant many councils have lost track of where the lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs might be.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: ldquoFortunately we have relatively few lsquono ball gamersquo signs and, where we do, these tend to be formal places such as by the Kibble Palace Glasshouse in the Botanic Gardens.ldquoOur city should feel welcoming to everyone, including children, and not discourage healthy outdoor play. We want to take a common-sense approach and regularly facilitate traffic-free Streetplay events for younger people.ldquoIf there are lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs situated where in the city which residents feel are not required, wersquoll consider removing them.City of Edinburgh Council announced in March that it planned to give residents the chance to report any old lsquono ball gamesrsquo signs which are no longer regarded as necessary. A spokesperson said at the time: ldquoWe know that there are a number of no ball gamesrsquo signs that have been up in open spaces for some time.ldquoSome may no longer be required or there may be other options for how the areas are used.Elsewhere, Falkirk Council says signs are under review: ldquoWe do not want to deter children from playing outdoors and have removed a number of these signs from council land in the past, said a spokesperson.ldquoHowever, there may still be some of this historical signage but we do keep this under review.Meanwhile, Fe Councilrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoFes position is that it dfers from community to community and we respond directly to their wishes on this issue.

No matter what might befall Scotland and how it might be governed in future the basic human rights of its citizens, respecting their faith, sexual orientation, race and political beliefs were now deemed to be sacred. In future there might still be greed and corruption and malfeasance at the heart of public le and in the grand offices of state but the people had now been empowered by something greater than them all.The beauty of the ECHR lies not merely in the clarity and nobility of its language but in the way that no detail pertinent to the peace and happiness of the inidual is overlooked. Article  in the substantive protocols to the ECHR has this to say about education. ldquoNo person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any s which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.This protocol seemed to reinforce another great legislative testament to Scottish enlightened and progressive thinking, the  Education Act. This guaranteed the right of Scotlandrsquos Catholic population to have their children educated by the state according to the norms and mores of their faith. The Act wasnrsquot an endorsement of religious indoctrination it didnrsquot grant a licence for sectarianism. It was simply an acknowledgment of the important role that faith plays in the lives of many of its citizens. Following the harrowing experiences of the Great War it was also an acknowledgement by the state that Catholic children, ravaged by high levels of malnutrition and the effects of multi-deprivation, might be needed to fight any future existential threat to our freedoms and democracy.For more than a century now Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools have flourished and are regularly found to have excelled, under strict inspection, beyond the boundaries of their initial remit. Over several decades when the influx of Irish-Catholic refugees fleeing the Great Famine risked inflaming tensions with the indigenous Protestant working classes the existence of these schools has helped in the process of peaceful integration. They act as bridges where the old and cherished beliefs of a religious minority can meet and converse with the greater Scotland beyond. In disadvantaged neighbourhoods they continue to perform heroically and offer children in these places hope and a slender chance of a rewarding le. Scotland should be proud of them. And we Scots of Irish-Catholic stock should be proud too that we live in a country which cherishes dference and ersity and values our communityrsquos distinctive contribution to its public le.Nicola Sturgeon recognised this last year at a celebration to mark  years of Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools. She said: ldquo is the centenary of the legislation that brought Roman Catholic schools into Scotlandrsquos state education system. In that time, Catholic schools have made a tremendous contribution to Scottish education, and this is something we want to see continue. We value the contribution that Catholic schools make to modern Scotland. We want that contribution to continue in the years ahead.One year on from the First Ministerrsquos eloquent endorsement attacks on Catholic schools remain predictably depressing. The most recent follow skirmishes in Glasgow earlier this month when an Irish republican parade was confronted by protesters. Predictably, this was portrayed as another outbreak of religious sectarianism. Yet, it probably owed more to the current heightened tensions surrounding the prospect of a hard Brexit, the Irish border and inflamed British nationalism. In a remarkably ignorant and badly-written article a former deputy chief constable in Police Scotland used this isolated and rare occurrence to justy shutting Catholic schools. ldquoWe also need to look at the roots of the problem and question what ides us, he wrote. ldquoAndwe do that then we simply cannot escape questioning our system of religiously segregated education. His words were a sinister reminder of why large sections of the Irish-Catholic community traditionally beheld Scotlandrsquos police forces with deep mistrust.The independent Advisory Committee on Tackling Sectarianism set up by the Scottish Government has produced several wide-ranging and exhaustive reports. These specically and unequivocally stated that Catholic schools were not even remotely a cause of sectarianism in Scotland. It also pointed out that, in any case, sectarianism was largely in retreat in modern Scotland.So, in the absence of any evidence that Catholic schools contribute to sectarianism and in spite of counter-data that they actually foster multi-culturalism and tolerance what lies at the root of these attacks  Letrsquos speak frankly here. The people who are most vocerous in their hostility towards Catholic schools also purport to cherish ersity and equality. Yet they want these only within the bounds of a narrow and illiberal agenda. It is group-think that relies on old and discredited tropes that were once used to alienate and target minorities. These people simply donrsquot like the idea of Catholic schools but have nothing to justy their hostility. Each year they are reduced to scanning Scotlandrsquos cultural horizon looking for any little wrinkles that can be swollen into  outrage.Professor Sir Tom Devine, Scotlandrsquos foremost historian, said of this: ldquoIf there was one action certain to inflame sectarian tensions in Scotland it would be any suggestion from the Scottish lrmGovernment of an intention to abolish Catholic schools. That would rightly be regarded as an attack on the Catholic community itself.Laughably, the same people who attack Catholic schools are often to be found in the cultural vanguard that disdains Orange Parades. Of course, nice, well-dressed climate and political protests where we all stop for croissants and smoothies at some chi-chi deli are deemed acceptable. But Orange parades where the marchers, often poor, are hanging on to that pillar of their existence that lends meaning to their lives are considered beyond the pale. Not for the first time this Scot of Irish-Catholic heritage finds more common ground with the Orange Order than with the intolerant liberals who seek to ban their walks. It seems that we have a common and implacable enemy."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-confirms-yes-vote-independence-reversed","story":"The First Minister said she thought such an outcome was unlikely, but acknowledged democracy meant people would be entitled to cancel a Yes vote though another referendum.The previously unreported comments, made in Berlin on Wednesday, are likely to fuel calls for a confirmatory vote being made a precondition of holding Indyref.They also suggest the aftermath of any Yes vote could be as politically turbulent as the one following Brexit, as Unionists could try to have the result overturned.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoAs soon as you say a referendum result is irreversible, by definition itrsquos not democratic.ldquoBecausepeople change their mind, orcircumstances change, thentheyrsquore not allowed to change the decision, then itrsquos not democratic.Asked directlya vote for independence could be reversed by a later vote for the Union, she accepted it was a possibility, adding: ldquoItrsquos up to people to decide the future they want.The Scottish LibDems and Tories said it was a recipe for endless ldquochaos.:Paul Hutcheon: In indyref, the stakes would be so much higher for UnionistsMs Sturgeon has said she wants another vote on the constitution next year, but the UK Tory Government has so far refused to grant Holyrood the necessary powers to hold it.Labour has said it is open to a second referendum, provided Nationalist parties win a fresh and unambiguous mandate, with some Labour MPs also pushing for a confirmatory vote on the outcome of independence negotiations between Edinburgh and London.Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks are fully consistent with her desire to revisit the No result of the  referendum and the Brexit result of the  referendum.However they will dismay parts of the Yes movement, including some SNP MPs, who warned her not to set a precedent by backing a second Brexit referendum in case it opened the door to Unionist challenges to independence.The SNP Governmentrsquos  White Paper on Independence was silent on the possibility of a further referendum, declaring that independence would follow  months of negotiations.Senior SNP politicians also try to avoid hypothetical questions about a Yes vote possibly being overturned.But Ms Sturgeon, in Germany to meet politicians and business leaders and receive a media prize for being a ldquovoice of reason on Brexit, was unable to escape her own logic on the issue.:Jeremy Corbyn will not allow indyref in lsquoformative yearsrsquo of Labour governmentAt a press conference at the German Council on Foreign Relations, she was asked by a Czech news agency reporterthere would be a third independence referendumshe lost Indyref.After saying she thought Scotland would back independence, she said: ldquoNo politician can decide that a country no longer has the ability to choose its own future.

Such is its prevalence, online retailer Asos announced earlier this year that it would blacklist \"serial ers\", while the fashion brand Diesel pokes fun in an autumn campaign with the tagline \"enjoy before ing\".Its been suggested that social media is fuelling the practice with people posing for photographs in trendy clothes before sending them back to get a refund.Among those aged  to , a survey found  per cent say they dabble in a sneaky wear-and-.

When we started the strikes,I look back at my first speech, it was all about how we need to wake up the world. No one was talking about climate change. Now what wersquore saying is that the world knows and now we need to act.To me the first step to changing everything is awareness. Itrsquos a really huge thing and powerful. I do feel itrsquos working. Everybody knows that climate change is a thing now, and itrsquos an actual issue that will affect us.

When I was younger I always had a fascination with the ocean and that was reaffirmed when I went snorkelling with my parents. I realised it was beautul, and this beautul place needed protecting.I felt pretty angry that we as human beings were destroying that incredible place ndash whether it be through plastic pollution or climate change. So I decided, with my sister, that we were going to start climate striking on December . We believe we were the first in the UK. Back then there was no Extinction Rebellion in our area, no Scottish Youth Climate Strikes. So we got in contact with Fridays for Future, the organisation that Greta set up. It grew from there.It angers me that we as human beings have let it get this bad. We were being told back when it was black and white TV that there was such a thing as climate change. What did we do  We just pretended it didnrsquot exist. Itrsquos human nature to leave everything to the very last minute. If we do that with climate change there will be no stopping it.I would like our governments to actually do something. Politicians can say climate emergency, but what does it actually mean  We need radical action. We need net zero by . Wersquove got till  to turn this ship around. If we donrsquot reach that deadline then the world is basically doomed. And I hate to put it like that because Irsquom usually quite optimistic.I find it shocking that people my age donrsquot think that climate change is real. It is the greatest threat that we as humanity have ever faced. I read books, IPCC reports, online articles. Because we know the stuff, we become the teachers and we teach everyone . I feel like we as climate strikers have almost a role to educate. We shouldnrsquot be having to do this. It should be the government. But currently it is us ndash and we can educate people about the climate crisis and about some of the small things they can do.Martine Miller, parent, EdinburghIrsquove become more and more educated recently about climate change and what our future is going to look like.

When we first started it was literally just  of us including a few friends from Peebles that I managed to drag up to Edinburgh. Now its tens of thousands. I do think people are starting to listen. I think therersquos not enough panic though. Irsquove found that quite a lot of the time with the politicians, they will secretly tell us, ldquoI shouldnrsquot be saying this but I think itrsquos really good that yoursquore striking. They just think itrsquos good that wersquore getting involved in activism and that wersquore having a political say.Quite a lot of the debate about the strikes is more about the action of us striking rather than what wersquore actually trying to say and the reasons why wersquore striking.There is also still so much that our government can do in Scotland that they arenrsquot doing right now.

The environmental groups that support them insist that Big Oil must be shut down to prevent further global warming. It all seems very worthy, and herersquos my opinion: they are distracting us from the real problem.Donrsquot get me wrong here ndash climate change is all too real and will cause dficulties in the decades to come. My grouse with the protests is that they drown out the discussion that should be taking place instead.The world population of humans are increasingly city dwellers. In the UK almost  per cent of us inhabit the urban landscape. Our food is produced by farmers with their diesel-fuelled tractors the food they harvest is then transported to our shops by diesel-fuelled lorries. Electric tractors and lorries do exist but are not common yet.The climate protestors should note that oil as a fuel must not be phased out until alternative methods of fuelling tractors and lorries are in place and can be shown to cope with the challenge of feeding our huge urban population. Get this one wrong and billions will starve - itrsquos that serious.Step back to  when the world population was . billion. The global economy had been recovering from the recent war, and received a boost when huge oil fields were brought on stream in the Middle East and North Africa. Cheap energy fuelled a humongous increase in human activity lsquothe great accelerationrsquo academics call it.From  to now, humans, particularly in the affluent west, have seen a substantial change to their standard of living.During this time the world avoided major famines, not the least because of the lsquoGreen Revolutionrsquo in the s when wheat and rice yields increased substantially. In consequence, the world population has increased to over . billion today. Thatrsquos an extra five billion people since . Cheap oil is responsible for underpinning this huge population increase. If oil runs out and nothing takes its place, the props fall away . Plan A is thus to replace oil with alternative energy sources as a priority. We have to.Dylan Hamilton, , LinlithgowOne analogy I use to explain why young people are pushing this is the boiled frog. If you put a frog in a pot of water and slowly heat up the temperature the frog will boil and die. Butyou put a frog into already boiling water, it will immediately jump out. So the boiled frog represents the grown up, but the young people are the frog that jumps out. The dference is wersquore tied to the boiled frog andwe all donrsquot act then we all die.Irsquove been striking weekly since February . I met Greta in August in Switzerland. What struck me was that she is a really down to earth person. I was on crutches at the time and she was the only person in the entire room that helped me carry my food.The things Irsquove learned over the past eight months are actually less to do with climate change and more to do with society ndash the little political tricks, how to talk to politicians. I think wersquore having an impact on how politicians think. Every time they make a policy, wersquore in the back of their minds. Nicola Sturgeon declared a climate emergency and the Greens have said wersquove given them momentum to push harder because they can say wersquove got tens of thousands of young people pushing for this as well. Scotland likes to claim that theyrsquore a world leader andthis is threatening their status as a world leader, theyrsquoll try to keep up the the good profile. Not quite enough is being done but itrsquos better than it was.Obviously what I want from these strikes is for us to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. But more specically what I think they could do is implement a Green New Deal. So we would become a renewable and completely sustainable society ndash because at the moment our system isnrsquot built to be sustainable and renewable. We use the term Just Transition a lot. We would have to have a Just Transition to get jobs in renewables so people wouldnrsquot be out of work. Everything would have to be renewable and not killing the earth.Hilary Brown, marketing manager, EdinburghAlthough I am a politically aware person and have marched many times over the years, it is fair to say that my daughterrsquos concern about climate crisis and her much repeated plea, \"Wersquove just  years to stop climate change before itrsquos too late\" led me to commit to joining the global strike. I should have been working, but made a very last minute decision to walk away from it and support the strike. She and her friends have attended some the Friday climate strikes and I am proud of their commitment to raising the urgency of the climate emergency as a political priority. I also find it demands a personal response from me. Younger people are understandably able to focus on the immediate threat posed by climate emergency and donrsquot hedge their bets in terms of what needs to be done about it. There are so many lsquoah butsrsquo and lsquowhat srsquo that plague any debate for politicians and that stop people from committing to radical change. I have very valid distractions plus a degree of complacency and,Irsquom honest, cynicism about the ability to make change happen. I find that the young climate strikers are bringing clarity to the issue and making me acknowledge the need for urgent and sustained action. I am blown away by Greta Thunberg ndash how well informed she is and the way she articulates the reality of the situation facing the world ndash not in her first language either! I donrsquot really like the generational blame game. Many people my age and older have marched and campaigned all their lives and won many rights. They have made the world a better place for all of us lucky enough to claim those rights. But I do understand the anger young people feel about the future they face. Itrsquos not so much that they are more aware of the issue than their elders. We are all well aware. The dference is their sense of urgency about doing the things needed to tackle it. I find there is less and less excuse for me, as a person with dependents and a whole iety of responsibilities, not to make this as much of a priority as they do."},{"url":null,"title":"39-re-gloomed-cope-times-eco-anxiety","story":"ldquoI was thinking way more about humans rather than nature. Only recently have I been more connected with the environment. Irsquove realised that this is way bigger than just the humans. The fact that nature is being exploited and destroyed right now ndash thatrsquos the bit that stresses me out most.Stress is just one of the feelings she and other young people experience around climate change. Fridayrsquos mass climate strike in the September sunshine, a riot of colour and noise, looked on so many levels like a flowering of positivity. But the words used by the young people out that day do not come from the spectrum of joy.They were, naturally given the scale of the issue, ldquoangry, ldquoterried, ldquoscared, ldquoworried. In the same week, the United Nations Childrenrsquos Fund warned that the biggest emerging threats to children globally, are ldquothe worsening climate crisis, a decline in mental health and online misinformation.What do we do with the fact that this generation, already troubled in terms of mental health, is now having to process chilling facts about the future of our planet and humanityrsquos role  How do those of us who are parents, or adults connected to children, work through this with our youngsters, who are now coming across this information at sometimes a very young age As Caroline Hickman, a psychotherapist working with the University of Bath and the Climate Psychology Alliance, points out, adults too are having many ldquocomplicated feelings around the climate emergency. ldquoBut theyrsquore also thinking, how can I cope with my childrenrsquos feelings  How can I support my grandchildren Sometimes these feelings are described as eco-anxiety, a current buzzword, as Hickman observes, an inadequate descriptor for the full range of emotions around climate crisis.ldquoAnxiety is the gateway in, but then people go through a whole process of emotions ndash depression, despair, frustration, among young people, that adults arenrsquot doing something, and hopelessness, and blaming.Scottish climate-strikers will frequently mention eco-anxiety. One, -year-old Dylan Hamilton, says there are times when he has felt ldquoreally down. ldquoIrsquove never felt like giving up. But I struggle a lot because I also have chronic fatigue, so it makes everything ten times more dficult. I have to constantly keep up and be on top of my learning. That can be really stressful and Irsquove had a few burn outs, but I never stop striking.Dylan first started to question how we were behaving around the environment when he was eight. ldquoI was in the eco committee at school, he recalls, ldquobut I got really fed up because it felt like all we were doing was taking out the bins. I feltit is as serious as yoursquore telling me then we should be doing more than just taking out the bins. That, he says, triggered a mental state of ldquohopelessness for a while.However, he says, striking has helped hugely. ldquoI feel like Irsquom doing enough, which has really helped my mental state. Wersquore actually a really supportive group because we all get each otherrsquos problems and wersquove got loads of people we can turn toit is stressing us out.But these youth activists are not the only young people to have been impacted our current wave of climate crisis stories. All children are. Few can have escaped hearing the news that the earth is warming, the ice caps melting, the polar bears threatened, and plastic is everywhere.In this context how we talk to our children about it becomes crucial. Over the past year, it has become a question for me. How much do I share, as I cover climate related issues, of both the information and my own rollercoaster feelings, with my sons aged  and  Hickman believes that talking is the most important thing we need to do with our children. She recalls how six months ago she interviewed an eight-year-old in a bid to find out how might be best to talk to youngsters. She said to her, ldquoOkay Sophia, I want to talk to you about some scary things ndash climate change ndash but I want to find a way to do that that doesnrsquot terry and overwhelm you. What would you suggest we do Sophiarsquos reply, she says, is something she often quotes. She said: ldquoThe thing is, it is dficult, but you must tell me the truth. Andyou donrsquot tell me the truth yoursquore lying to me ndash and Irsquom not a baby.ldquoI loved the way she put that, says Hickman. ldquoShersquos spot on. We mustnrsquot treat them like theyrsquore babies. They do need to be prepared for the realities of these things. But a parent needs to be able to process their own feelings a little bit to talk to the child. They need to have taken a little bit of time and thought, well how do I feel  How upset am I  Whatrsquos getting in the way of me talking to my child  Irsquove talked to a few children about this and they saidyou donrsquot talk to us, we feel abandoned.In , The Mental Health Foundation published a poll of parents exploring how, in an era of -hour news and social media, they felt their children were responding to larger world events andthey were able to adequately discuss the issues with their children. Around a third of parents said their children were anxious around global warming and climate change.Off the back of their poll, they published some advice, which, they suggest, might be relevant to parents concerned about how they handle their childrenrsquos exposure to climate crisis news. ldquoThe advice that wersquove developed, says Julie Cameron, head of programmes at The Mental Health Foundation Scotland, ldquois that trying to have a news black-out and shield your children isnrsquot helpful. Likewise, of course, neither is extreme over-exposure.Cameron suggests taking time to watch the news with your child, particularly an age-appropriate show like Newsround, and making sure that there is plenty of opportunity for conversation following it. ldquoItrsquos taking the time to explore this with them. Itrsquos okay to acknowledge that this is quite scary and tricky stuff and that none of us have complete control over it. You also need to reassure them that itrsquos okay and in their day-to-day le they are safe. Amongst their advice too is that itrsquos good for adult mental health to get ldquocivically involved. ldquoThis is probably applicable to children too. We say become civically active, become engaged.That activism can be good for mental health is something that Hickman echoes. Itrsquos also a frequent reflection from those young people who are deeply involved in the climate strike. ldquoStriking helps me deal with it, says Muller-Stuart. ldquoItrsquos definitely empowering. Because otherwise you can feel so helpless ndash like yoursquore the only one. You go to a global strike where there are thousands of other people and itrsquos more empowering and it makes you think itrsquos not just you. Therersquos a lot more hope. Another emotion that climate strikers frequently express is anger ndash often at the older generations. As John Thorne, secretary for Climate Psychology Alliance Scotland notes, ldquoIf yoursquore , yoursquove done very little to cause this issue, and yoursquove got a total right to be angry about it and thatrsquos a good thing. Because being angry and upset means we do something.But it would be wrong to paint a picture of a modern world ided into adults who are in denial and young people who are the truth speakers and sufferers of eco anxiety. Itrsquos not quite like that. Many adults in the environmental and other radical movements, or working in renewables, or researching related science, have been trying to address this issue for a very long time. Adults get despair too ndash and grief, and another more hampering emotion, guilt.Another problem, Hickman says, parents find, in dealing with their childrenrsquos climate-related distress, is that there is nothing in their personal histories to relate the current crisis to. ldquoIf your child comes home upset because of bullying, as a parent you can call on your own experience of dealing with those problems. But we havenrsquot got our own history of dealing with this.Of course, all of us will recall some global or national threat from our own childhood: the nuclear threat, HIV Aids. Hickman believes this is not quite the same. ldquoWhat makes this subtly dferent is the fact that wersquore all culpable for this, even through the small decisions we make. There is also a great deal of uncertainty attached to it. It may be man-made, but itrsquos not in our control ndash we donrsquot know when the tipping points will be. That makes us utterly vulnerable and hugely aware of our dependency on our environment.These are things I hear echoed by many young people. They are acutely aware of their own impacts, yet at the same time of their smallness in relation to the problem. ldquoItrsquos so big, says Charlotte Muller-Stuart, ldquoand therersquos so much. Itrsquos also hard to switch off from. You canrsquot really brush it off. Everything that you do, every single day, is somehow affecting the environment in some way.We are lucky, in this country, to be, as yet, relatively little impacted by climate change. This makes it easier to comfort our children, tell them they are currently safe. Thatrsquos not the case for all children. Hickman has also interviewed children in the Males, who are on the frontline of sea-level rises. ldquoThe children there, she observes, ldquoare saying itrsquos happening now. They said to me, lsquoPeople in Iceland had a funeral for a glacier, we watched it online ndash wherersquos our funeral  Who is going to care about us rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-view-kind-scotland-want","story":"Today, The Herald on Sunday had been planning a special Climate Strike tribute edition, with the front page, The Big Read, and multiple pages inside, dedicated to the greatest environmental demonstration ndash and one of the most positive, joyful, hopeful, outpourings of human emotion ndash the world has ever seen.The morning after, young people in Glasgow would have wakened up from one of the best days of their lives, exhilarated, probably still adrenaline-fuelled, definitely unable to get the smiles off their faces, only to be told by their parents: ldquoPlease stay out of the city.

And almost all of Scotlandrsquos once-thriving tidal pools were left to the elements and the raging sea to drt into sad decline.Now, however, as outdoor wild swimming rises in popularity and the health benefits of enjoying a dip in the sea are once again being appreciated, renewed efforts are being made to revive interest in, and preserve, some of Scotlandrsquos many seawater tidal pools.In Wick, a group of volunteers is stepping up efforts to reinstate The Trinkie, a natural rock pool which emerges from an imposing shelf of Caithness stone and which until a few years ago was still a popular summer haunt for brave swimmers.Now more appreciated for its nostalgic value and for its rock pools than as a swimming location, the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group has launched a determined effort to save it from crumbling andit to something resembling its former glory.Meanwhile, at Tarlair pool in Macduff, Banffshire, efforts are being stepped up to restore the A-listed s architectural gem which sits alongside the seawater pool, paddling pool and boating pond, which once boasted a tea pavilion, boating lake, changing rooms and ing board.In the East Neuk of Fe, where tidal pools were popular in fishing villages and seaside communities, a community action group is within touching distance of receiving pound, of funding to restore Pittenweemrsquos tidal pool which once featured a slide and ing  but which has lain unused for decades.The ambitious project to revitalise the pool, which can be traced back to , is said to have already captured the imagination of a new generation of outdoor swimmers, with summer crowds recently packing the previously abandoned pool.Further north in Moray, locals faced with the loss of the small tidal pool at Portknockie recently raised almost pound, for repairs to a leaking valve and other wear and tear to ensure its survival for future generations to enjoy.Catherine Patterson, secretary of the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group, says there has been a surge of support from local people keen to see storm damage at the Wick pool repaired.ldquoWe have been getting an overwhelmingly positive response to our efforts to save The Trinkie, she says.ldquoIt was badly damaged in a storm a few years ago which has left a signicant hole in its main wall. Itrsquos deteriorating and it needs attention before further damage is done.The group has had a structural study carried out and is in the throes of raising the pound, needed to do the work.ldquoI learned to swim there as did generations of local people, adds Patterson.ldquoOur recent survey had tremendous responses from people who have fond memories of it and who still go there to explore the rock pools and look for crabs.ldquoWe want to restore it for its historic role in the area where people gravitated to, and enjoyed, visiting.Interest in tidal pools is thought to have been sparked both by a resurgence in interest in wild swimming in Scotland, plus a wave of nostalgia for a simpler age when summer holidays were spent closer to home.Far humbler than full-scale lidos with their properly constructed and heated swimming pools such as at Stonehaven and Gourock, tidal pools tend to emerge from the rocks, usually supported by manmade walls and access points, and which naturally replenish regularly with a fresh flood of seawater.They rose in popularity among Victorian and Edwardian swimmers who wanted to enjoy the bracing outdoors.Tidal pools cropped up around the coast, including in Dumfries and Galloway where Victorians invested over pound in the construction of a distinctive oval-shaped Powfoot tidal pool in a bid to encourage outdoor swimming ndash although an unfortunate incident when a group of young girls nearly died after being stranded by the tide did endear it to many.The UKrsquos most northerly pool, in Scalloway in Shetland, was bulldozed in  to make way for a car park.Burgh councils in holiday spots along the East Neuk and East Lothian seized the opportunity to attract tourists, with tidal pools springing up in St Andrews, St Monans and Cellardyke, North Berwick.The one at Dunbar eventually grew to become Scotlandrsquos largest open-air tidal pool with its Olympic standard ing board, pavilion and added attraction of the annual Miss Dunbar Bathing Suit Competition.Even in their heyday, many pools had little in the way of safety features, and were often accessed by just a set of slippery concrete steps or a rusty handrail.Lack of water filters meant taking a dip could mean dodging seaweed and occasional debris.At Pittenweem, the long rectangular tidal pool emerges from the line of blackened rocks which stretch into the Forth, accessed either from the sandy beach or down clfside steps chiselled from the sandstone.Once one of the most popular tidal pools on the Fe coast, it originally included a ing board, clftop pavilion and changing rooms for swimmers.According to David Thomson, chairman of the West Braes project in Pittenweem which is driving forward plans to restore the pool to its former glory, there are hopes that it can be restored in time for next summer.ldquoThe pool used to be incredibly packed with swimmers, with a paddling pool, boating pond and ing board, he says.ldquoThe council stopped maintaining it in the s and it was a shame to see it start to decline. Cracks started to appear and we realised thatwe didnrsquot do something it would be lost forever.The group is close to finalising pound, of funding from Fe LEADER and Fe Environment Trust, with work planned to start in February.Thomson adds: ldquoIt was a case of use it or lose it.ldquoWe have already seen renewed interest in it from wild swimmers who travel here to use it, and local families.ldquoThey have realised we have this beautul thing on our doorstep and we should try not to lose it."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-labour-39-s-self-destructing-brexit-policy---negotiate-reject---incoherence-stilts","story":"Labour are of course correct that the Liberal Democrats have made a nonsense of their own party name by refusing to recognise the democratic vote for Brexit in .

Publicity for the event said that, with a backdrop of ldquocrashing global bioersity and climate breakdown, Scotland can become a ldquoworld leader in restoring its land and seas to good health.It suggested a ldquobold approach but Micklewright, speaking exclusively to The Herald on Sunday, urged caution.He said the time was right to lobby for rewilding, with a Scottish Government that wants to be seen to be progressive: ldquoWe need to work on how we talk about rewilding, and how we communicate about it effectively and how we get Scottish Government policy to enable rewilding.ldquoWe need to be clear about what it means.What it doesnrsquot mean, he is clear, is ldquoextreme rewilding where large tracts of land are completely unmanaged. Thatrsquos because of invasive alien species, which would take over, and the lack of large predators.As a result, under any rewilding scheme for the foreseeable future, plenty human management of deer and plants such as rhododendron will be needed.ldquoRewilding in Scotland is about baby steps. Wersquore not ready in many ways to let nature fully take over some parts of Scotland, therefore we need to intervene for a very long time, he said. ldquoThe idea has been suggested that rewilding is another form of Highland Clearances, getting people off the land so we can bring back a wilderness. Rewilding isnrsquot that at all: humans are a vital part of the landscape and enabling rewilding.ldquoIf rewilding happens there will be more jobs here in land management and showing people whatrsquos here, in tourism, and in sustainably using what the landrsquos providing. Itrsquos about repeopling as well as rewilding ndash the two are very compatible.Asked about apex predators ndash animals at the top of the food chain ndash he said: ldquoIntroducing wolves is the last thing we want to do because wersquore not ready ... and the landscape needs to be prepared for something like that.ldquoMore importantly, these animals arenrsquot going to come back on their own so itrsquos a conscious decision to bring them back and wersquore not ready for that conversation yet.ldquoItrsquos a major distraction and cause of ision, whereas most of what rewilding is all about, most people would buy into.ldquoApex predators are a long, long way down the road. Just by doing preparation for the land to be wilder doesnrsquot mean we will ever bring back predators because there may never be the will to do that.He said ing the lynx was more likely than the wolf, but added: ldquoWe would have to work out exactly what the concerns are and what we need to do to make sure those concerns are dealt with.The organisers of this weekendrsquos conference, Scotland: The Big Picture, is a group of film-makers, writers and photographers who campaign for rewilding. Director Peter Cairns backed Micklewrightrsquos approach, saying he felt some charities and campaign groups are nervous of talking about rewilding: the word has become ldquotoxic.ldquoFrom a UK perspective it has become synonymous with theof large carnivores and farmers being evicted off their land, he said. ldquoReintroduction is an element but only one element.Landownersrsquo organisation Scottish Land  Estateswas represented at the conference. Sarah-Jane Laing, its executive director, said: ldquoUsing the term lsquorewildingrsquo can cause problems because it means many dferent things to dferent people.ldquoIt is crucial, before any change in land use begins, to consider robust, scientic evidence and to consult with those who will be directly and indirectly affected, including those who live and work in rural Scotland.She said many SLE members do ldquorewilding work: ldquoTherersquos already lots of activity taking place in Scotland supported by SLE and our members, from wildcats and red squirrels to peatland and pinewood projects."},{"url":null,"title":"rewilding-scotland-apex-predators-distraction-complex-debate","story":"In trying to put the apex predator debate on the back burner, the Scottish Rewilding Alliance accepts there will always be problems in Scotland with the idea of restoring large carnivores.Not least because on an island wersquoll never see the naturalof animals such as the wolf and lynx, as has happened in Europe and North America. It would have to be a positive decision, and that will raise oppositionConservation has traditionally been about saving habitats and species. The concept of rewilding takes things a step further, rebuilding wild habitats already degraded and, crucially, reintroducing species removed by man.Rewilding appeals because, when manrsquos environmental impact is leading to potential catastrophe, it gives something back, but reintroducing animals to ecosystems radically changed since they were last here is fraught with dficulties.The keynote speaker yesterday at the Scotland: The Big Picture conference was Sean Gerrity, pictured, the American behind the American Prairie Reserve project. For the last  years it has been trying to rewild , square miles of Montana, while maintaining the human population and rural economy. It has  bison, after reintroduction.Gerrity has walked the -mile West Highland Way in recent days and said: ldquoThere are wolves in the Netherlands now, working very nicely, there are wolves back in Germany ... from what I saw you have more than enough space along the northern West Highland Way for wolves and brown bears.Such ideas will always face opposition from farmers, land managers and local people concerned for the safety of livestock, children, pets and people.Apex predator the white-tailed eagle was reintroduced from Norway to Rum in , almost  years after the last Scottish specimen was shot, and has spread to Mull and the surrounding mainland.While itrsquos a hit with tourists, its presence is resented by sheep farmers, as lambs appear to be a regular feature of some birdsrsquo diet.It seems those involved in the restoration believed that as there was little predation on sheep by eagles in Norway, it would not be a problem here, but failed to appreciate sheep here are reared dferently, living all year, and lambing, on open hillsides.The past decade has seen suggestions the Eurasian lynx should be reintroduced. The medium-sized woodland cat ndash the size of a Labrador ndash would prey on roe deer, whose growing numbers damage trees.Proponents say it would be highly unlikely to prey on livestock, but Oban farmer Angus MacFadyen, chair of NFU Scotlandrsquos Environment and Land Use committee, who has seen stock affected by sea eagles, said: ldquoThere is no appetite for such reintroductions ... species reintroductions have hijacked the rewilding agenda.He pointed out many farmers are involved in work such as protecting native species, carbon capture, agro-forestry and bioersity schemes that are part of the wider rewilding agenda.Some wealthy estate owners and charities are trying to restore the ecosystems of the uplands which have been denuded of trees and stripped of wildle.For example, Paul Lister wants to fence his ,-acre Alladale estate in Sutherland and reintroduce wolves there.Listerrsquos plan has run into dficulties because of Scotlandrsquos access laws. Even more modest rewilding faces objections: estates which drastically cut deer numbers to restore trees act as a ldquovacuum, sucking in animals and reducing the number to be shot by paying guns on neighbouring estates.This year, beavers illegally released in Tayside, which now number around , were given protected status,  years after the last native beavers were shot.The animalsrsquo dams buffer rivers against floods and provide rich habitats for other species, but they cause serious flooding in arable fields.Other reintroductions are likely to cause less of a stir.Nature charity Trees for Le wants to reintroduce wood-ants to some Scottish woods, and the Atlantic Woodland Alliance has just been set up in Scotland to encourage the spread of west-coast woodland and its mosses, lichens and flowers."},{"url":null,"title":"50-scots-shaped-world-three-hidden-heroes","story":"However, we knew it would be an impossible task to cover everyone and so asked you, our readers, to send in suggestions of people we might have missed.Here are three ideas we received this week ... do you agree William MurdochI would respectfully wish to draw attention to, in my humble opinion, one major omission ndash William Murdoch.He was born on August , , in Lugar, near Cumnock in Ayrshire. He was the third of seven children and the first son to survive beyond infancy. His father was a millwright and young William soon learned to help out with the family business.However, his yearning for education lay well outside the rural community in which he grew up.

Initially being a little envious of the talent displayed by Murdoch, it was only later in the design stage that Watt credited him with his important input.However, William Murdoch will be best remembered for his own invention: coal gas lighting.

I do think the time has come for clarity on this question and the Scottish Labour Party, the Welsh Labour Party take a similar view that we should be more overtly Remain.\"But the key thing where we are in the chronology of Brexit is that Jeremy Corbyns leadership has forced Boris Johnson into a position where hes got no mandate for his position of a no-deal Brexit and hes also embraced the idea and said categorically that Labour would put any deal back to the people.\"Mr Leonard also threw his support behind Mr Corbyn, who earlier on Sunday vowed to serve a full term as Prime Ministerthe party won the next General Election.He added: \"Jeremy Corbyn has been extremely strong in his leadership in getting the opposition parties to get together and block the Boris Johnson no-deal Brexit plan. Well need to see whether Boris Johnson abides by that decision of Parliament and that law.\"It gets into very interesting territory where there is a prime minister, who has got no mandate as Prime Minister for his government, who is standing on a policy which is in effect no-deal Brexit, for which there is no mandate either.\"The position is that weve said we want to put any deal back to the people and weve said in doing that we want a Remain option to be on the ballot paper but there would by the same token be a Leave option on the ballot paper too.\"I guess the question is around what form that Leave option would take and so theres been discussion about what the red lines of a Labour government negotiation with the EU would be.\"Mandates came into question again when the MSP was also asked about another Scottish independence referendum.Mr Leonard was previously been against the idea but has come into line with Mr Corbyns position that it would not completely be off the table after a few years of a Labour government.He said: \"The Labour position going into the General Election, whenever it comes, will be that we oppose the creation of a separate Scottish state, that we oppose independence and, therefore, that we oppose the holding of a second independence referendum.\"Where there has been some discussion is aroundthere was to be a renewed mandate which showed not only electoral but demonstrable public support for the holding of a second referendum, then there would need to be some consideration given to that.\"We had an independence referendum just five years ago and thats got to be a factor in considering whether the circumstances are right for a second independence referendum to be held.\"All of the evidence shows that even people who voted Yes in , even some people who are supporting the SNP, do not think that the time is now for a second independence referendum.The party leader noted the circumstances under which the  referendum came about after the SNP had gained an ldquounprecedented, completely unexpected overall majority.\"What Im saying is I dont see the circumstances today and I dont see them in the foreseeable future where we would be back[another poll] in that kind of space again,\" added Mr Leonard."},{"url":null,"title":"david-cameron-cites-39-frustration-39-alex-salmond-urging-queen-intervene-independence-vote-campaign","story":"Buckingham Palace made clear its ldquodispleasure at the former Prime Ministerrsquos revelation that he had asked Her Majesty to ldquoraise an eyebrow at the prospect of an independent Scotland.A senior source made clear \"it serves no ones interests\" for conversations between the PM and the head of state to be made public, stressing: ldquoIt makes it very hard for the relationship to thrive.\"But Mr Cameronrsquos request had the desired effect as days later the Queen urged Scots to ldquothink very carefully about their future interpreted widely as her urging voters to stick with the Union.The former Conservative leader expressed his ldquodelight at Her Majestyrsquos intervention, saying later her comments \"helped to put a slightly dferent perception\" on the campaign.In an interview with Sky News Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Mr Cameron acknowledged his revelations, made in a BBC documentary, had caused consternation but defended his decision, saying the suggestion he had revealed details of a private conversation with the monarch was not \"correct\".He explained: \"What I have said in that programme, and I dont want to add to it in any way, was about conversations between my aides and her aides, actually.\"Emphasising the political context, the ex-PM, who is carrying out a media blitz to promote his memoirs, added: \"Alex Salmond was saying that Her Majesty would be the proud monarch of an independent Scotland.\"There was a frustration in my team and thats why the conversations between one set of aides and another set of aides took place.

No more studio bound interviews across a desk begone the politician standing in front of a bog standard garden trellis. But going out of a controlled environment has its risks, as The Andrew Marr Show demonstrated.: Corbyn calls for recallMarr is a ldquobig window show, the window in question containing a live shot of the Thames. Through it we can see the subdued bustle of a Sunday morning in London, trains going to and from Waterloo, boats chugging through the water at sightseeing speed. There is no sound, because that would interfere with what is being said, which is, after all, why we are all here on a Sunday morning.Marr took the window idea to Brighton, which seemed at first like a smart move. We could see a pier, lots of expensive flats along the waterside , and a beach complete with strollers and joggers. The problem was what we could hear. Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from London, it was the artist known as Shouting Man.Shouting Man, with his trademark ldquoStop Brexit bellow, can be heard in the background to almost every interview on Westminsterrsquos College Green. He is not the same as Glockenspiel Man, Liberty Bell Man, Drum Man, or any of the other characters who like to express their political opinions through the medium of music.Shouting Man gave viewers a brief burst from his limited repertoire, then went quiet for a bit. He might have been having a cup of tea and a bacon roll, he could have been doing an interview , or a researcher had popped down to plead with him. But soon he was back, in full flow. Marr and Corbyn were determined to ignore him, but it was a struggle, for them as much for the viewer.: Cameron cites frustration with SalmondMarr ploughed on, asking the Labour leader about attempts to oust Tom Watson as his deputy. Corbyn said he knew there were to be discussions but was not aware a motion was being put forward. ldquoIrsquom not all seeing and all knowing. Irsquod love to be.What about the departure of a key aide, Andrew Fisher, as reported in the Sunday Times  He was said to have walked out claiming Corbyn could not win a General Election, and accusing his leadership team of a ldquolack of professionalism, competence and decency. That was all fine, too, said Corbyn. Why, they had enjoyed a cup of coffee together that morning. He even tried a joke, saying of Mr Fisher: ldquoWe do frequently argue ... about football. He supports Spurs. Stand-ups everywhere relax: you are never going to lose a gig to Jezza the Joker.Attempts were made to discover which side Mr Corbyn would be on in any referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, all to no avail. As for his staying a full term as PM, the answer was a spirited ldquoof course.Ridge on Sunday opted to set up shop in the exhibitors section of The Brighton Centre. Nestled next to the information counter and a Labour Party merchandise stall. Passersby stopped now and then for a look before wandering off. Unlike with Marr, the setting added atmosphere without interruption.Ridge went for iety over big names, with a line-up that included Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, who dismissed as ldquofake news claims that he had been behind efforts to ousts Tom Watson. To make up for the Corbyn-sized hole in the show, Ridge had been busy where in the week, bagging interviews with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and the previously shy and retiring David Cameron who, now he has his memoirs to flog, is everywhere.: Macwhirter on Labours Brexit policyOn the former PM asking for the Queenrsquos support during the Scottish independence referendum campaign, he replied: ldquoIrsquove said all I want to say so you can ask me questions but Irsquom going to say very, very little. Ridge reminded him that he had spoken about his conversations with the Queen on not one but two occasions. First, when he was overheard saying the monarch ldquopurred on learning No had won, and second in a BBC documentary when he had asked the Palaceshe could give some sort of indication, half an eyebrow raise, to indicate her support for Scotland staying in the Union.Any conversation on the latter was not with the Queen, said Mr Cameron, but between his aides and her aides. Ridge gamely battled on.ldquoAlex Salmond was saying that Her Majesty would be the proud monarch of an independent Scotland, conceded Mr Cameron. ldquoThere was a frustration in my team and thatrsquos why the conversations between one set of aides and another set of aides took place. But thatrsquos it. I donrsquot want to say any more because I donrsquot want to make the situation worse than it is.Out of the window we could see the London cityscape.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

This year Orkney boasts seven venues — some of which are participating for the first time,As far as local people are concerned, Doors Open Days is about getting into buildings for free and seeing things that you don#t often see. If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This policy, says Thornberry, shows the Lib Dems are “kind of Taliban”.By any measure, this is an idiotic take. But this is where we are. This is how low Labour has sunk under the pitul leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.Thornberry’s remarks to The House magazine came after Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said thatshe became prime minister before the Brexit deed was done, her government would revoke Article . The Labour frontbencher was not alone in reacting furiously to this position. From across the political spectrum came howls of anger. The Lib Dems were undemocratic, they were prepared to treat the electorate with contempt.For sure, in these ided times, they are plenty of voters ready to lap up these attacks on Swinson. But polls published in the aftermath of the row over the policy showed that others are not quite so furiously angry. One showed the Lib Dems in second place behind Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party while other had them just a point behind Labour.If it was running candidates in the next UK general election, the Taliban would kill for polling results like those.Of course, people who cling to the belief that Brexit will mean a great national liberation are not going to like Swinson’s policy. Of course, they are going to attack it. But it is not, no matter how loudly they screech, undemocratic.In order for the Lib Dems to be able to revoke Article  and stop Brexit in its tracks, the party would have to win a majority at the next general election. Swinson would require a democratic mandate to do what she wants. How depressing that this perfectly obvious fact is ignored by the likes of Thornberry.In Scotland, we have more experience than our neighbours on these islands of living through the aftermath of a binary referendum. We understand how referendums can impact on subsequent voter behaviour. Following the  independence referendum, the SNP received a considerable boost to its electoral fortunes. Anyone who’d voted Yes in the referendum wasn’t about to back Labour or the Conservatives, were they But the nationalists weren’t the only ones to turn the result of the referendum to their advantage. Under Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tories styled themselves the defenders of the Union. While Labour squirmed and wobbled on the constitutional question, Davidson was unequivocal that a vote for her party was a vote to prevent a second independence referendum.In the  Holyrood election, the Conservatives knocked Labour into third place.The Lib Dems’ position on Brexit makes perfect political sense to me.While career-long Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn refuses, against the wishes of the majority of his party members, to take a firm anti-Brexit position, Swinson has the space to become the champion of those who believe that departure from the EU will have catastrophic consequences.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now fighting for Brexit at any cost. He would rather “die in a ditch” than ask the EU to postpone our departure date of  October.Idiots and the terminally naive may believe that such a clear position can be defeated by nuance . It cannot.Brexit dominates our politics and ides the electorate. There is no mileage to be gained by opposition parties in trying to win over those now rallying around Johnson’s No Deal flag. Rather, the prize – the only prize currently on offer – is becoming the leading opponent to Johnson’s Brexit “plan”.Labour is currently bogged down in yet another crisis of its own making. A now abandoned plot to abolish the position of deputy leader in order to punish the current holder of the position, Tom Watson, for daring to speak out about issues such as anti-Semitism and Brexit is yet more proof that Corbyn and his cronies are more interested in leftist sectarianism than they are in providing credible opposition to the Conservative Party.Those Labour members who continue to delude themselves that their leader might be a viable champion for their pro-EU beliefs should seek out online an interview conducted by ITV journalist Joe Pike last week, during which Corbyn refused eight times to answer the simple question of whether he was pro-Leave or pro-Remain.Swinson’s position on Brexit is bluntand, I think, stands a good chance of capturing the mood of a great many voters. Davidson has shown that, when it comes to binary matters, it is best to pick a side and then stick to it.The chances of the Lib Dems ever being in a position to enact this new flagship policy are, it has to be said, slender. Recent polling might have the party neck and neck with Labour but Boris Johnson’s Tories continue to be the clear front-runners with voters.But, given the Lib Dems were all but destroyed by a voter backlash against their five years in coalition government with David Cameron’s Tories, being able to revoke Article  is not the only prize for Swinson. The revitalisation of her party would be quite the achievement.Politicians from left to right may insist that what voters want is for Brexit to be over and done and for MPs toto dealing with the domestic agenda. I wonderthere’s a degree of projection in such remarks.So far as I can see, Brexit shows no sign of becoming less important to the electorate. And while this is so, Swinson is quite right to take a hard Remain position. If ever there was a time to pick a side, it is now.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn defends neutral stance in second eu referendum","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has defended his plan to go into a possible snap general election without saying whether he would campaign to remain in the European Union in a second Brexit referendum.The Labour leader hopes to negotiate a new Brexit deal with Brussels and put that to a public vote against the option of staying in the EU.Mr Corbyn promised a special Labour conference for party members to decide whether to endorse a new Brexit deal his government would negotiate, or back Remaining in the EU.\"What we have said is that we would want to hold a consultation, a special conference of our party at the point that we have got this offer from the EU, weve got this as a remain - and hopefully reform - option,\" he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.\"Because I do think even those that are strongly in favour of remain would recognise the EU needs to have some reforms.\"The Labour leader said he would “go along with whatever decision the party comes to” on Brexit, and did not rule out giving Labour MPs a free voteBoris Johnson brings a deal back to the Commons.Mr Corbyn risked angering Labour’s pro-EU membership by suggesting the UK could be better off after Brexit, with the right deal.“Please remember why people voted Leave, why people voted Remain, but also remember there is more that unites all of those people – over austerity, over investment, over education, over housing, over health, over a green industrial revolution – than there is that ides them,” he said.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said the comments show Mr Corbyn “can’t lead his own party”.“Jeremy Corbyn this morning refused nine times to sayLabour would support Brexit eventhey negotiated a deal with the EU themselves, showing Labour offer nothing but dither and pointless delay,” Mr Cleverly said. “Jeremy Corbyn can’t lead his own party, let alone the country – he can’t even make up his mind on the most important issue facing the country.“He would delay Brexit until at least  and even longerthe EU demand it – Brussels would be in the driving seat and Corbyn would accept anything from them.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, whose party has pledged to revoke Article it forms a majority government, said: “Jeremy Corbyn has once again refused to deny thathe becomes Prime Minister his government will be a Brexit government.\"This will be deeply concerning to millions of Labour supporters who want to campaign to stop Brexit and cannot get any clarity from Labour.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit means a border in ireland jean claude juncker confirms","story":"A no-deal Brexit will result in a border on Ireland and checks on goods crossing between Europe and the UK, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker confirmed.Mr Juncker insisted that Brussels was \"in no way responsible\" for the consequences of a no-deal scenario, saying the blame would lay squarely with the UK.He also hit back angrily at claims from Brexiteers that his an unelected bureaucrat, calling that a \"typical British lie\".In an interview on Sky News Ridge on Sunday programme, Mr Juncker said \"we can have a deal\"alternative arrangements called for by Boris Johnsons government provided the basis for replacing the controversial Irish border backstop.The Prime Minister has demanded that the backstop - a contingency plan to prevent a hard border by keeping the UK aligned with many of Brussels rules - should be scrapped.Mr Juncker said: \"We have to make sure that there will be no hard and physical border between the two parts of the Irish island and things have to be done on a level playing field.\"If these three objectives are met by the alternative arrangements, then we dont need the backstop.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site.

Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  .

Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38519427.ece/e923f/BINARY/courts%20gavel.jpg","title":"jon tonge another divisive week in brexitland and theres no sign of fog clearing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game. It might be harder for Arlene Foster at an election, even allowing that the DUPs support has held up perfectly well in the three years since the EU referendum.The endgame will probably not become clear until the European Council meeting in mid-October. It may be autumn but it is neither mellow nor fruitful. Just very misty, with little sign of the fog clearing.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool.

No, it was put in place in order to preserve the rights of the internal market and of the island of Ireland.”But in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Juncker said there would have to be checks.He added: “I’m not an architect of new border stations. The British have to tell us exactly the architectural nature of this border.“I don’t like a border because after the Good Friday Agreement, and this Good Friday Agreement has to be respected in all its parts, the situation in Ireland has improved. We should not play with this.”He said: “We have to make sure that the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved.“An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter without any kind of control the European Union via the southern part of the Irish island. This will not happen. We have to preserve the health and the safety of our citizens.”When askedthe Prime Minister of Luxembourgs decision to hold a press conference next to an empty podium where Boris Johnson was supposed to be was helpful, Jean-Claude Juncker said \"I rather consider that this was not very helpful\" #Ridge pic ioTwORlNq— Ridge on SundaySeptember , He said the EU “is in no way responsible for any kind of consequences entailed by the Brexit” as “that’s a British decision”.He suggested that some MPs are “forgetting about the history” of Northern Ireland and Ireland.Mr Juncker’s meeting with Mr Johnson in Luxembourg on September  came just hours before the country’s prime minister Xavier Bettel criticised the Tory leader and left an empty podium for him at a press conference.The European Commission president said: “I don’t knowthis is helpful. I rather consider that this was not very helpful but it’s his decision.”Mr Juncker also criticised former UK prime minister David Cameron over the build-up to the  Brexit referendum, claiming he failed to explain the agreement reached with Brussels.“We agreed the deal back in , I think, between David and ourselves but this deal was never explained to the British public. Never.”Former prime minister David Cameron has warned Boris Johnson that “breaking the law is not a good idea”.With the Supreme Court hoping to announce its decision this week on the legality of the Prime Minister’s prorogation of Parliament, Mr Cameron told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “No deal is not a good idea. Breaking the law is not a good idea. Focus everything you’ve got on getting that deal, and that’s what he’s doing, to be fair to him.”Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government will respect the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Prime Minister’s move to suspend Parliament in the run-up to Brexit.Mr Raab told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Of course we will respect whatever the legal ruling is from the Supreme Court.“But I think we are getting a little bit ahead of ourselves.”Mr Raab said: “We will see what the Supreme Court will decide.“We are confident, we wouldn’t have appealed the casewe weren’t confident in the position that the Government had taken.“I can reassure you, of course we are going to abide by the Supreme Court judgment.”Askedthe Government would prorogue Parliament againit wins the case, Mr Raab said: “I think, let’s wait and see what the first judgment decides and then we’ll understand the lie of the land.”Pressed on whether Northern Ireland could have dferent EU customs arrangements to the rest of the UK, Mr Raab said: “No, of course, that would be wrong.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Sterling warned that a no-deal Brexit would have a \"profound and lasting effect\" on Northern Ireland and that economic activity would drop by around % over  years. He also expressed concern about the impact on beef, sheep and dairy farmers.He also said , small firms, employing , employees, would see exports affected. He added: “There is potential for regulatory ergence in the electricity market. The lights will not go out but we could see an increase in prices. We may face a signicant disruption to supplies of foods, medicines and chemicals, again leading to higher prices.”Stormont institutions have not been ing for more than two and a half years. Mr Sterling also pointed to warnings that there could be public protest and civil unrest in Northern Ireland in a no-deal scenario.The top civil servant also said a sense of threat to peoples identity, calls for a border poll and political instability was making it more dficult for Northern Irelands political parties to restore the political institutions.  “So our assessment is that the cumulative impact of all of this will be grave for Northern Ireland politically, economically and societally,\" he said.“We have been working without the direction of democratically elected and accountable ministers for over two and half years now.

He lost his seat on the last count and Mr Manton wasnt elected.It is understood that the legal action centres on an alleged verbal agreement between the UUP veteran and his party over the conduct of the campaign.Earlier this week, Belfast High Court heard that Mr McGimpsey is to pay £, for ly referring to Derry-born Republic of Ireland player James McClean as a \"super-Provo\". His legal action against the UUP pre-dates that settlement.Mr McGimpsey has been a UUP member for  years and retains membership of the Knock and Ballyhackamore branch.He had been a councillor for almost two decades representing Court and Castlereagh Central before being elected in Lisnasharragh in .Both Mr McGimpsey and the UUP yesterday declined to comment. The veteran politician is also suing Mr Manton for libel. Mr McGimpsey alleges that his running mate defamed him on social media.Mr Manton had tweeted in response to an interview Mr McGimpsey had given prior to the count in which the councillor said he didnt know Mr Manton. \"He was in the Conservative Party and he joined us I think about a year ago so I dont really know the guy. Ive spoken to him once I think,\" Mr McGimpsey said.Mr Manton then tweeted that he wanted to \"clary\" that he had been a member of the UUP \"since January \" and he went on to make other remarks Mr McGimpsey alleges were defamatory.Mr McGimpsey is one of his partys most left-wing and liberal members. He has long been pro-choice on abortion and is a staunch animal rights supporter and critic of Belfast Zoo.Belfast High Court heard on Wednesday that the veteran UUP man will pay the compensation to James McClean in two instalments. Mr McGimpsey had already issued an unreserved apology for the remarks which he said were made \"in the heat of the moment\" in an interview with BBC Radio Ulsters Nolan Show last year.He also paid substantial damages to Sinn Fein councillor Ciaran Beattie for \" and unfounded\" Facebook comments about him last year.Mr McGimpsey and his older brother Michael rose to prominence in the mid-s when they challenged the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the Dublin courts.Speaking previously about the legal action, he said: \"The lawsuit was very much my baby. It cost a fortune. \"I linked up withKen Maginnis, who launched a campaign to raise money for the case and there was enough money raised to pay the legal bills.\"Although they lost, he said it was worthwhile. \"The idea was either to get the Anglo-Irish Agreement declared unconstitutional, which the Irish state was never going to do, or undermine the credibility of Articles  and  of the Irish Constitution, and thats what we achieved,\" he said. \"In its editorial the morning after the court decision, thewrote: McGimpsey lost the battle but won the war.\""},{"url":null,"title":"end of further meat factory blockades welcomed","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The cases would be the first ever Ebola infections confirmed in the East African country.The United Nations health agency says it was made aware on September  of the death in Tanzania’s commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, of a patient suspected to have Ebola. A day later, it received unofficial reports that an Ebola test had come back positive. On Thursday, it received unofficial reports that a contact of the patient, who had travelled widely in the country, was sick and in hospital.A rapid response is crucial in containing Ebola, which can be fatal in up to % of cases and is most often spread by close contact with bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms or with contaminated objects.The WHO statement said the lack of information from Tanzania made it dficult to assess potential risks.The Ebola outbreak based in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo has infected over , people and killed nearly , of them. A few cases have been confirmed in neighbouring Uganda as well, and other neighbouring countries have been preparing for the outbreak’s possible spread.This is not the first time health officials have raised serious questions about the suspected Tanzania cases. On Monday, the US health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters in Uganda that he and others were “very concerned about the lack of transparency” in Tanzania.Critics have shown increasing alarm as Tanzanian President John Magufuli’s government has restricted access to key information and cracked down on perceived dissent. Politicians recently approved an amendment to a statistics law to make it a crime to distribute information not sanctioned by the government or which contradicts the government.The World Bank was among those expressing concern at that amendment."},{"url":null,"title":"youth leaders at un demand bold climate change action","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There was talk of hashtags, entrepreneurial ideas and climate art and poetry.Kenyan activist Wanjuhi Njroge said: “Be that hummingbird that puts out the forest fire by fetching water with its small beak as all the other animals, including the elephant, told her it was impossible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"70 year old marathon man dedicates last run memory","story":"A Derry man who has been running competitively for the past forty years will take part in his last full marathon next month in memory of former club member, Martin Gallagher.Harry McNulty is one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club and a familiar face in the local running circuit.At the age of  he has decided to bow out of full marathons but will continue to compete in shorter distances and will no doubt be seen sporting the famous purple colours of his club as he treks through the streets of Derry or tackles the back roads of Donegal.He grew up in Melmore Gardens, Creggan, and now resides in the Waterside area of the city.The -year-old has run  half marathons and will compete in his st, and final, full marathon on October  in Dublin.Harry comes from a family of seven, five boys and two girls, and his brothers Dessie and Brendan were considered the runners in the family. Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote. You are not worried whether people in the district get a job or not.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The streets of Ballynahinch will have Christmas lighting this year mdash at leastthe townrsquos Chamber of Commerce have their way.At a well attended meeting of the Chamber on Tuesday evening, it was unanimously agreed to purchase the lights in an effort to brighten the townrsquos main thoroughfare for the festive season.Whether they are erected and illuminated, stress the Chamber, now depends entirely on the business community and townspeople of Ballynahinch.This step forward was made possible by support from a number of traders in the town and the exhaustion of the chamberrsquos present funds.The Ballynahinch committee feel that what other towns in the locality have achieved they can emulated.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Councillor Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill said this week he is still hopeful that some industry can be attracted to the vacant factories at Castlewellan and Annsborough.Mr OrsquoNeill, who has been fighting for Government intervention since the factories closed last month, revealed that efforts have been made to attract new industries.He told a meeting of Down councillors that although nothing had yet happened, he believed that the efforts to attract new industries had been lsquoconscientiousrsquo.ldquoIt is a lamentable situation with two factories lying idle but I still remain hopeful that something will come out of it, said Mr OrsquoNeill.MOURNES mdash A planned motor cycle competition on the slopes of Slieve Donard in Newcastle has been turned down by local councillors.Councillors agreed on Monday that the event would encourage the improper use of the Mourne Mountains because it was planned in an area of outstanding natural beauty.ldquoEvents such as this should be discouraged to preserve the amenities of the area, said a council spokesman.The event, called lsquoEndeavour Motor Cyclersquo, was to have been staged by the Mourne Motor Cycle Club.DOWNPATRICK mdash Army bomb experts carried out a controlled explosion on an explosive device which had been placed on a windowsill of the Northern Bank at the junction of St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street, Downpatrick, on Thursday evening.Police received a call at .pm stating that there was a suspect device at the premises and the bomb experts were called in.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

No, it was put in place in order to preserve the rights of the internal market and of the island of Ireland.”But in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Juncker said there would have to be checks.He added: “I’m not an architect of new border stations. The British have to tell us exactly the architectural nature of this border.“I don’t like a border because after the Good Friday Agreement, and this Good Friday Agreement has to be respected in all its parts, the situation in Ireland has improved. We should not play with this.”He said: “We have to make sure that the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved.“An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter without any kind of control the European Union via the southern part of the Irish island. This will not happen. We have to preserve the health and the safety of our citizens.”He said the EU “is in no way responsible for any kind of consequences entailed by the Brexit” as “that’s a British decision”.Ben Lowry: An Irish language act cannot be granted to stop abortion Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He suggested that some MPs are “forgetting about the history” of Northern Ireland and Ireland.Mr Juncker’s meeting with Mr Johnson in Luxembourg on September  came just hours before the country’s prime minister Xavier Bettel criticised the Tory leader and left an empty podium for him at a press conference.The European Commission president said: “I don’t knowthis is helpful. I rather consider that this was not very helpful but it’s his decision.”Mr Juncker also criticised former UK prime minister David Cameron over the build-up to the  Brexit referendum, claiming he failed to explain the agreement reached with Brussels.“We agreed the deal back in , I think, between David and ourselves but this deal was never explained to the British public. Never.”Former prime minister David Cameron has warned Boris Johnson that “breaking the law is not a good idea”.With the Supreme Court hoping to announce its decision this week on the legality of the Prime Minister’s prorogation of Parliament, Mr Cameron told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “No deal is not a good idea. Breaking the law is not a good idea. Focus everything you’ve got on getting that deal, and that’s what he’s doing, to be fair to him.”Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government will respect the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Prime Minister’s move to suspend Parliament in the run-up to Brexit.Mr Raab told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Of course we will respect whatever the legal ruling is from the Supreme Court.“But I think we are getting a little bit ahead of ourselves.”Mr Raab said: “We will see what the Supreme Court will decide.“We are confident, we wouldn’t have appealed the casewe weren’t confident in the position that the Government had taken.“I can reassure you, of course we are going to abide by the Supreme Court judgment.”Askedthe Government would prorogue Parliament againit wins the case, Mr Raab said: “I think, let’s wait and see what the first judgment decides and then we’ll understand the lie of the land.”Pressed on whether Northern Ireland could have dferent EU customs arrangements to the rest of the UK, Mr Raab said: “No, of course, that would be wrong.”try catch  TrendingN.I. heartbreak as promising young footballer dies suddenlyElderly NI woman who dies after road traffic collision is

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The travel company is at risk of falling into administration unless it finds pound million in extra funds.It was feared the collapse would leave up to , UK holidaymakers stranded.But Mr Raabtold the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning: ldquoWe have got all the contingency planning to make sure no one will be stranded.ldquoI donrsquot want to give all the details of it because it depends on the nature of how people are out there, whether they have got a package holiday or whether they just paid for the flights and sorted out something separately.He added: ldquoBut I can reassure people that in the worst case scenario, the contingency planning is there to avoid people being stranded.Hi Joe, we understand you are unsettled by all the media speculation surrounding Thomas Cook.

Itrsquos a much bigger scale than Monarch. There is a real risk thatthe worst comes to the worst proper arrangements may not be in place for the repatriation programme and staff are still working while not knowingthey have a job or will even get paid for this month, he told PA.He said the Government did not act on its own review which followed the Monarch collapse, adding: ldquoThis is a mess that could have been avoided. Ministers need to step forward and take responsibility for the sake of passengers and staff.Thomas Cook reassured worried customers on Saturday night that their flights continue to operate as normal and all their package holidays are ATOL-protected.However, tourists at the Les Orangers beach resort in the town of Hammamet, near Tunis, say their hotel is refusing to let guests leave while demanding extra money.Ryan Farmer, from Leicestershire, told BBC Radio Fiversquos Stephen Nolan the hotel had on Saturday afternoon summoned all guests who were due to leave to go to reception ldquoto pay additional fees, obviously because of the situation with Thomas Cook.With many tourists refusing to pay on the grounds they had already paid Thomas Cook, security guards were keeping the hotelrsquos gates shut, refusing to allow guests out, or to let new visitors enter.ldquoWe canrsquot leave the hotel. Irsquod describe it as exactly the same as being held hostage, Mr Farmer said.The Transport Salaried Staffs Association , which represents workers at the company, said the Government should be ready to assist with ldquoreal financial support.General secretary Manuel Cortes called for an urgent meeting with Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom.TSSA General Secretary @Manuel_TSSA has today written to the Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, demanding an urgent meeting about the rescue of #ThomasCook.https:t.co IopUhklE pic hOjQUesmmdash TSSASeptember , He said in a letter: ldquoIt is incumbent upon the Government to actrequired and save this iconic cornerstone of the British high street and the thousands of jobs that go with it.Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: ldquoThe Government faces a simple choice between a pound millionGovernment cash injection to save the company now versus a pound million bill to repatriate UK holidaymakers.It is understood that Thomas Cook has approached the Government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding.A Government spokesman said: ldquoWe recognise itrsquos a worrying time for holidaymakers and employees.ldquoThe financial circumstances of inidual businesses are a commercial matter, but the Government and the Civil Aviation Authority are monitoring the situation closely.Mr Cortes called for the Government to reveal how much it is prepared to spend repatriating thousands of Thomas Cook holidaymakers.He said: ldquoWe hope a deal can still be done but Dominic Raab and other ministers must come clean and tells us exactly how much the Government is willing to spend bringing , British holidaymakers home.ldquoThere no escaping the fact that doing so will cost more than the pound million needed by Thomas Cook to survive.ldquoFactor in the potential loss of , jobs, plus benefit payments and loss in tax and national insurance revenue, and it makes no sense whatsoever for the Government not to step in and rescue Thomas Cook.ldquoThis calls for strategic thinking. Thomas Cook was run very successfully in public ownership between  and .ldquoThe Government now taking a stake, or completely taking it over, must not be ruled out as this will be an investment.ldquoSaving Thomas Cook would cost a very small fraction of the billions used to shore up banks during the financial crisis..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Thomas Cook holidaymakers won ut be left stranded, Foreign Secretary says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
