The previously undisclosed TSA program requires federal air marshals to follow ordinary US citizens through airports and on flights, documenting their every moveWhile specific countries are not on any TSA bulletins regarding the program, air marshals revealed they were advised in several instances to follow passengers solely because they had traveled to Turkey. When a passenger on the Quiet Skies list is selected for surveillance, a team of air marshals is placed on their next flight. The marshals are given a file that contains a photo of the target as well as their basic information, including when and where they were born. They then observe the target at length from the minute they get to the airport in one destination and leave it in another. Marshals must note whether they were \u0027abnormally aware\u0027 of their surroundings, which could include reversing or changing directions in the airport, \u0027attempting to change appearances\u0027 by changing clothes or shaving on the plane, and boarding late or \u0027observing the boarding gate from afar\u0027. Behavior indicators that marshals must track are excessive fidgeting or perspiration, facial flushing, rapid eye blinking, strong body odor, sweaty palms, a \u0027cold penetrating stare\u0027, wide open staring eyes, face touching, and an \u0027Adam\u0027s apple jump\u0027. They must also note if the target\u0027s appearance has changed, including whether they\u0027ve gained or lost weight, whether their hair length or style has changed, and if they\u0027ve changed their facial hair.General observations that are tracked include whether the target used a phone to talk or text, if they were in possession of a computer, did they check their baggage or take a carry-on, and if they used the bathroom.           Federal air marshals must track everything about the person\u0027s behavior, referring to a lengthy checklist to make minute by minute observationsMarshals must also know if the subject used public or private transportation to leave the airport after their flight. Passengers can remain on the Quiet Skies list \u0027for up to 90 days or three encounters, whichever comes first\u0027, TSA documents state. Thousands of Americans have already been tracked under the program and there are about 40 to 50 Quiet Skies passengers on domestic flights every day. Around 35 of them are always being observed by air marshals.   Dozens of air marshals have expressed their concern with Quiet Skies since it launched in March. Some marshals have gone as far as to seek legal counsel, fearing that the domestic surveillance program could be illegal. Others believe the program is a waste of taxpayer dollars and only erts time and resources away from legitimate threats. The Air Marshal Association has also spoken out against the program.  \u0027The Air Marshal Association believes that missions based on recognized intelligence, or in support of ongoing federal investigations, is the proper criteria for flight scheduling.

There remain major questions over how much of the waste put out for recycling by households actually is recycled (file picture)Amounts going to incinerators have risen in recent years, while a high proportion is sent for recycling abroad.The export trade in recycling material took a blow last year when China announced it would stop accepting large amounts of western rubbish.          Local councils are in charge of recycling policies in their areas and governments have been slow to be involved since the first councils to abolish traditional weekly bin collections found themselves facing a backlash from the public a decade ago.The new compulsory recycling systems introduced once-a-fortnight collections of general waste.However voters showed their disapproval in local elections and ministers in Gordon Brown’s government tried various schemes to push up recycling rates without upsetting voters.These included a pay-as-you-throw bin tax and a kitchen slopbucket system, which is now in use in many areas, in which food waste goes in a special bin and householders have to use up to eight different recycling boxes.The three-weekly system is seen by its backers as a way of pushing up recycling rates while causing the least upset among voters.Martin Tett of the Local Government Association told the Sunday Times: ‘Our own polling shows that eight out of 10 people are happy with the way their local council collects their rubbish.’Rubbish piles up as families wait three weeks for bin collections | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/17/08/3OcJmetwDg47977dea51b3096d94-4126862-While_the_debris_proved_the_plane_went_down_in_the_Indian_Ocean_-a-12_1484640066888.jpg","title":"Tour force Britains got new sporting superstar","story":"    Geraint Thomas, 32, is greeted at the finish line of the Tour de France in Paris by his wife Sara          Sara, a TV presenter who has anchored the coverage of Le Tour for Welsh channel S4C, arrived just in time to embrace her husband as he triumphantly crossed the line (pictured)          His wife Sara Elen, 27 (pictured hugging him after the 20th stage) couldn\u0027t bear to watch as he inched closer to winning the Tour de France   Unknown to the Geraint Thomas, his wife Sara had flown in from Cardiff to greet him on the finish line of the penultimate stage of the gruelling 21-day Tour de France race for an emotional reunion (pictured) Waiting for him at the finish line in Paris was the ecstatic wife who has helped drive him to the top of his sport, Sara, 27.Thomas, who sipped champagne in traditional fashion during yesterday\u0027s final Tour stage, described his victory as \u0027insane\u0027 and \u0027the stuff of dreams\u0027.He spoke of the \u0027goosebumps\u0027 he felt riding through Paris watched by hordes of fans waving the Union Jack and the Welsh flag. Tear de France!

Football star Gareth Bale (left) and rugby legend Sam Warburton in their earlier years\u0027I don\u0027t think Hollywood could have come up with it. You could not have written it.\u0027Thomas, 32, is three years older than Bale and Warburton. But just like them he shared a love for all school sports and excelled in athletics. \u0027I\u0027ll never forget it, and I still see it now, how Geraint ran down that home straight in the final of the 1500 metres,\u0027 Mr Williams said.    Geraint Thomas aged 16 in his school sports portraitMany such shared stories made a book Thomas wrote a few years ago a publishing hit and genuinely one of the best in cycling\u0027s vast literature.He told of shaving his legs as a 14-year-old in a Port-a-loo at a race in Germany. Loving his first cycling-specific shades so much that he barely wore them. Suffering such an extreme case of the chronic fatigue cyclists call \u0027bonk\u0027 that, after pedalling home, \u0027I just kept nudging the doorbell with my forehead in the hope that someone inside might hear me.\u0027After 21 days in which the French have made it patently clear how much they loathe the clinical, robotic, po-faced Team Sky machine, grinding on to victory, Thomas provides the antidote. Never has one deeply unpopular team more needed a winner as self-deprecating and human as the man they all call \u0027G\u0027.There was normality from the start - not least school-days at Cardiff\u0027s Whitchurch High School where Thomas, Gareth Bale and Sam Warburton were all alumni within a three year period in the last decade: a Welsh golden generation if ever there was one.A life in cycling seems to have been a happy accident. The nine-year-old Thomas had turned up to swim at the local leisure centre, when he peered through a fence and saw the local Maindy Flyers club training on the track which encircles a neighbouring athletics track. \u0027He came along a few days later and had a go himself,\u0027 the club\u0027s Debbie Wharton said on Friday. \u0027When he first started, he was just like any of the other kids on the bike, wearing baggy shorts and trainers.\u0027 The Lycra came later. Despite prodigious early promise, many were coming around to the view that the 32-year-old had been cut out for a life in the slipstream.His years at the Tour de France have been defined by his work as a domestique for Chris Froome. A bad day is \u0027when Froome is alone in the front group of twenty and there are sixty kilometres to go,\u0027 he said in the book, \u0027The World of Cycling, According to G.\u0027 (Even the title is a mickey-take.)A good day is \u0027when you deflect every nightmarish arrow slung at you. One by one, you throw yourself onto the pyre so that your leader may be venerated.\u0027           Froome (right) appreciates the contribution Thomas has made to his four Tour de France winsHe has venerated Froome far less than Sir Bradley Wiggins, despite shepherding him to three Tour de France titles. It is impossible to avoid the impression that he likes Froome far more. Thomas found Wiggins\u0027 mood unpredictable, though he has found Froome\u0027s lack of ego and often vacant personality endearing.In one of their early encounters, Froome wore a traditional Kenyan sarong - \u0027also known as a towel worn as a skirt,\u0027 Thomas drily observed.Thomas also delighted in Froome\u0027s lack of cycling knowledge. \u0027Who\u0027s that Astana guy? He\u0027s quick,\u0027 he asked Thomas after the 2013 Tour of Oman. \u0027Mate, it\u0027s (Vincenzo) Nibali,\u0027 Thomas informed him.\u0027The success hasn\u0027t gone to his head,\u0027 Thomas has said of Froome. \u0027He can handle the mickey-taking - about how he stays upright on his bike, that he knows nothing about anything but cycling today. Tell him you\u0027re watching the Six Nations and he\u0027ll ask which six and why, what are they doing?\u0027 Even in the last three weeks, he\u0027s been brutally straight about his own place in their dual pecking order. \u0027I\u0027m just \u0027erm… maybe a bit more than a pawn,\u0027 Thomas said after the defining Stage 12, when he eased away from Froome to record an historic second consecutive stage win at Alpe d\u0027Huez.That was the evening Chris Boardman wondered aloud about whether all this modesty was actually a cover for a slight mental deficit.           The Welshman, who rode 20 stages of the 2013 Tour with a broken hip, is treated after a crash          Thomas early in his career as an older teenager racing for a Welsh team, years before he would become a world champion\u0027He\u0027s had several opportunities in the past and… folded, Boardman said on ITV. \u0027I think he\u0027s a little bit fragile on that front and it\u0027s a way to deflect the pressure.\u0027It was an allusion to the solitary off-days which Thomas always seems to have had in the mountains. He was fourth overall after a brilliant Stage 17 climb three years ago, but calamity on La Toussuire two days later saw him lose 22 minutes. He finished 15th.Others who know Thomas well agree that his career in the shadows of others have left the question of that elusive winning mentality answered. \u0027Others were always the stars,\u0027 one source tells Sportsmail. \u0027First Mark Cavendish, who he came through the track academy with, and then Wiggins and Froome on the road. \u0027The elite competitors tend not to be normal. Thomas is balanced. You could have a pint with him. That\u0027s not normal where these kinds of competitors are concerned.\u0027                        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/23/4EAE5CE600000578-6005103-image-m-4_1532903839057.jpg","title":"England rugby star Ben Foden romped PR girl 26","story":"      It\u0027s over!

Final figures are due August 15.Asked about the country turning into a one-party state, the CPP spokesman said it was \u0027the decision of the people,\u0027 adding that Cambodia\u0027s constitution allows for a multi-party system.But the ballot lacked any serious challengers after Hun Sen cracked down on the opposition last year, leading to the arrest one of its leaders and then the dissolution of the party by the Supreme Court.Opposition figures had urged a boycott of the poll.But election authorities warned they would take action against those pressing for a \u0027clean-finger\u0027 campaign and pointed to an 82 percent turnout as evidence that the boycott call had failed.Experts say high turnouts are common in authoritarian states where voter intimidation is more widespread.Yet in a sign of a kickback from unhappy voters, around 600,000 ballots - around 10 percent of the total - were spoiled, according to a preliminary count by the National Election Commission.   Sunday\u0027s ballot has prolonged Hun Sen\u0027s 33-year rule, but observers say that questions of legitimacy may haunt the wily political survivor as frustration sets in over lack of changeHun Sen came to power in 1985 in a country still plagued by civil war and his CPP has won every election since 1998.But wearied by a culture of impunity and corruption more than 44 percent of voters backed the opposition CNRP in 2013 polls, creating the most serious challenge to Hun Sen in years.This time the Cambodian leader ruthlessly moved against his critics in the election run-up, corralling civil society, independent media and political opponents.That led many western governments to pull their support from the vote.It was \u0027neither free nor fair and failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people,\u0027 the White House said in a statement.The US would consider a \u0027significant expansion\u0027 of visa restrictions introduced last year against some senior Cambodian officials, it warned.In contrast China, a key Cambodia ally which has provided cash and soft loans to Hun Sen\u0027s government without raising questions over human rights and democracy, offered its \u0027sincere congratulations\u0027 on the poll, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. The 65-year-old Hun Sen is also seen as a stabilising force in the eyes of many in a kingdom with a bloody and bitter recent history that s civil war, the horrors of the Khmer Rouge and occupation by Vietnam.Hun Sen has cultivated his support base through rural and urban infrastructure and investment schemes that have added malls and condos to the skyline of the once sleepy capital Phnom Penh.The premier also adroitly turned to Cambodia\u0027s garment sector, which employs about 750,00 people, showering cash gifts on workers in the months ahead of polls.\u0027I am happy that the Cambodian People\u0027s Party won overwhelmingly, more than previous mandates,\u0027 said supporter Sang Kimson, 38, the morning after the election.But many other Cambodians are despondent at the idea of yet another term for Hun Sen, who is among the world\u0027s longest-serving leaders.\u0027It is him again,\u0027 shrugged one man sitting outside a coffee shop who asked not to be named and who said he felt \u0027hopeless\u0027 watching the results come in.Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia ision at Human Rights Watch, predicted simmering discontent.\u0027I think what we will see here in Cambodia is continued passive resistance and anger by the Cambodian people, they weren\u0027t given the opportunity to vote for the people they wanted,\u0027 he said.Hun Sen has held onto power through political and family alliances in the police, military and media.He was installed as prime minister during the Vietnamese occupation of the 1980s after defecting from the Khmer Rouge, which killed a quarter of Cambodia\u0027s population from 1975 to 1979. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/17/4EABDC8300000578-0-image-a-51_1532881392116.jpg","title":"Speed limits traffic jam information beamed straight car dashboards new trial","story":"    Highways England is going to test new 5G technology on the A2 and M2 between London and Dover later this year (pictured at the M25 junction) and some gantries could be torn downThe £20million trial will start by Christmas and run until the end of 2020 and the technology will only work in the newest of cars.   The report says: \u0027This may eventually allow some roadside infrastructure, such as gantries, to be removed.\u0027 Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said the technology is there but is concerned about removing too many signs in case the technology fails. But it is already being used in  Belgium, France and Holland.Staycations ruined as torrential rain and 50mph gale force...Stansted luggage chaos as hundreds of unclaimed bags and...Back on the BOIL!

Some are not even toilet-trained or do not know how to dress themselves, she said.She did not explicitly blame parents, but said they \u0027clearly have the most important role here\u0027.Research from the Oxford University Press this year found that in some schools half of five-year-olds are behind in language skills, with disadvantaged children disproportionately affected.And the Department for Education said children with poor vocabulary at age five are more than twice as likely to be unemployed at age 34 as children with good vocabulary.Mr Hinds\u0027 pledge has been welcomed by campaigners. Education Endowment Foundation chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: \u0027The minister is absolutely right to set an ambitious target for closing the early literacy gap by focusing on the home learning environment.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/30/23/4EB3B2F500000578-0-image-m-173_1532991245724.jpg","title":"Guest reveals Bradley Cooper Leonardo DiCaprio Lady Gaga Matthew McConaughey Google camp","story":"Private eyes: A guest (above) who claims to have drank six Aperol Spritzes named off the celebrities in attendance at Google Camp in an Instagram story on Monday          Beach babes: She also named Matthew McConaughey, who appears to be attending with his wife Camilla Alves and their children      Fly the friendly skies: Celebrities have been flying in on helicopters for the annual conference, which will culminate in a massive dinner on Tuesday at the site of local Greek ruins (above)London teen, 18, snags $1MILLION prize after his team wins...\u0027Today, tomorrow, forever\u0027: Julie Chen declares her support...Paul Manafort made more than $60 MILLION working as a...Share this articleAnother woman who appears to have been working at the Google Camp dinner on Monday posted exclusive video of herself and co-workers dancing around with the rich and famous clientele who descended upon the resort starting on Sunday.It was a glittering scene of lights, through which the video seemed to catch Cooper in conversation with Corden and later Google founder Larry Page. Also seen at Google Camp was one of the world\u0027s most fit and active couples, Laird Hamilton and Gabriella Reece.The two were on-hand to lead some fitness sessions which were followed by ice baths, with Hamilton sharing a photo of his Monday morning yoga session.It was a stylish crowd that was first to arrive for the start of Google Camp on Sunday.Karlie Kloss, fresh off a modeling shoot in Beijing, touched down at the airport in Palermo before being flown to the Vedura Resort in a helicopter to meet up with fiancee Joshua Kushner.The supermodel, who turns 26 on Friday, posted a photo to her Instagram story of the view from the resort on Sunday afternoon, giving her followers a peek at the beachfront oasis.That photo also gave her followers a look at Barry Diller\u0027s massive yacht Eos, which he arrived to Google Camp on alongside his wife Diane von Furstenberg and CBS This Morning host Gayle King.There are still more guests to come, and rumors are building in the Italian press that Michael Jordan will also be joining the group this year, as he and wife Yvette were spotted vacationing over the past week with Ahmad Rashaad while also enjoying a round of golf at Verdura.

Early interests: Geraint riding a tiny bike at the age of three          Teenage promise: Geraint aged 13 riding for local club Maindy Flyers (pictured third from left)          Conwy Castle in Wales lit up in yellow as Geraint  glided to victory in the Tour de FranceA dedicated athlete, Thomas has previously spoken of his frustration over the \u0027monkish\u0027 lifestyle needed to get to the top. His career has already brought him two Olympic golds on the track as part of Team GB.      Football star Gareth Bale (left) and rugby legend Sam Warburton in their earlier years\u0027I don\u0027t think Hollywood could have come up with it. You could not have written it.\u0027Thomas, 32, is three years older than Bale and Warburton. But just like them he shared a love for all school sports and excelled in athletics. \u0027I\u0027ll never forget it, and I still see it now, how Geraint ran down that home straight in the final of the 1500 metres,\u0027 Mr Williams said.    Geraint Thomas aged 16 in his school sports portraitMany such shared stories made a book Thomas wrote a few years ago a publishing hit and genuinely one of the best in cycling\u0027s vast literature.He told of shaving his legs as a 14-year-old in a Port-a-loo at a race in Germany. Loving his first cycling-specific shades so much that he barely wore them. Suffering such an extreme case of the chronic fatigue cyclists call \u0027bonk\u0027 that, after pedalling home, \u0027I just kept nudging the doorbell with my forehead in the hope that someone inside might hear me.\u0027After 21 days in which the French have made it patently clear how much they loathe the clinical, robotic, po-faced Team Sky machine, grinding on to victory, Thomas provides the antidote. Never has one deeply unpopular team more needed a winner as self-deprecating and human as the man they all call \u0027G\u0027.There was normality from the start - not least school-days at Cardiff\u0027s Whitchurch High School where Thomas, Gareth Bale and Sam Warburton were all alumni within a three year period in the last decade: a Welsh golden generation if ever there was one.A life in cycling seems to have been a happy accident. The nine-year-old Thomas had turned up to swim at the local leisure centre, when he peered through a fence and saw the local Maindy Flyers club training on the track which encircles a neighbouring athletics track. \u0027He came along a few days later and had a go himself,\u0027 the club\u0027s Debbie Wharton said on Friday. \u0027When he first started, he was just like any of the other kids on the bike, wearing baggy shorts and trainers.\u0027 The Lycra came later. Despite prodigious early promise, many were coming around to the view that the 32-year-old had been cut out for a life in the slipstream.His years at the Tour de France have been defined by his work as a domestique for Chris Froome. A bad day is \u0027when Froome is alone in the front group of twenty and there are sixty kilometres to go,\u0027 he said in the book, \u0027The World of Cycling, According to G.\u0027 (Even the title is a mickey-take.)A good day is \u0027when you deflect every nightmarish arrow slung at you. One by one, you throw yourself onto the pyre so that your leader may be venerated.\u0027           Froome (right) appreciates the contribution Thomas has made to his four Tour de France winsHe has venerated Froome far less than Sir Bradley Wiggins, despite shepherding him to three Tour de France titles. It is impossible to avoid the impression that he likes Froome far more. Thomas found Wiggins\u0027 mood unpredictable, though he has found Froome\u0027s lack of ego and often vacant personality endearing.In one of their early encounters, Froome wore a traditional Kenyan sarong - \u0027also known as a towel worn as a skirt,\u0027 Thomas drily observed.Thomas also delighted in Froome\u0027s lack of cycling knowledge. \u0027Who\u0027s that Astana guy? He\u0027s quick,\u0027 he asked Thomas after the 2013 Tour of Oman. \u0027Mate, it\u0027s (Vincenzo) Nibali,\u0027 Thomas informed him.\u0027The success hasn\u0027t gone to his head,\u0027 Thomas has said of Froome. \u0027He can handle the mickey-taking - about how he stays upright on his bike, that he knows nothing about anything but cycling today. Tell him you\u0027re watching the Six Nations and he\u0027ll ask which six and why, what are they doing?\u0027 Even in the last three weeks, he\u0027s been brutally straight about his own place in their dual pecking order. \u0027I\u0027m just \u0027erm… maybe a bit more than a pawn,\u0027 Thomas said after the defining Stage 12, when he eased away from Froome to record an historic second consecutive stage win at Alpe d\u0027Huez.That was the evening Chris Boardman wondered aloud about whether all this modesty was actually a cover for a slight mental deficit.           The Welshman, who rode 20 stages of the 2013 Tour with a broken hip, is treated after a crash          Thomas early in his career as an older teenager racing for a Welsh team, years before he would become a world champion\u0027He\u0027s had several opportunities in the past and… folded, Boardman said on ITV. \u0027I think he\u0027s a little bit fragile on that front and it\u0027s a way to deflect the pressure.\u0027It was an allusion to the solitary off-days which Thomas always seems to have had in the mountains. He was fourth overall after a brilliant Stage 17 climb three years ago, but calamity on La Toussuire two days later saw him lose 22 minutes. He finished 15th.Others who know Thomas well agree that his career in the shadows of others have left the question of that elusive winning mentality answered. \u0027Others were always the stars,\u0027 one source tells Sportsmail. \u0027First Mark Cavendish, who he came through the track academy with, and then Wiggins and Froome on the road. \u0027The elite competitors tend not to be normal. Thomas is balanced. You could have a pint with him. That\u0027s not normal where these kinds of competitors are concerned.\u0027                        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/23/4EAE5CE600000578-6005103-image-m-4_1532903839057.jpg","title":"England rugby star Ben Foden romped PR girl 26","story":"      It\u0027s over!

When such a large group are booked in we can\u0027t serve food to anyone else so had to close to the general public.\u0027We only have a tiny kitchen and there was only myself in there so three courses for 60 people is a massive job for one person.          Anton Lofthouse, 34, is head chef at a south London pub and had a large party of 60 people pre-booked for a three course meal last week\u0027But they turned up an hour and a half late and offered no apologies or anything like that and they were a bit of a nightmare. So I decided to have a bit of fun.\u0027Catering for 60 is OK when they turn up on time but when they are late that can really set you back. The timings are tight so it is best if they let you know.\u0027It especially bad if they are late and we\u0027re missing out on other money we could be earning as we\u0027re turning customers away while waiting for them.\u0027\u0027They had asked for ice cream and stipulated that they wanted it in a big bowl rather than the small tubs we traditionally serve them in.\u0027But in a big bowl there is a lot of space left and obviously they also wanted chocolate sauce on it.\u0027So I thought they best way to do chocolate sauce with two scoops of ice cream was like that.\u0027There were two other staff working that night, one being my general manager and both noticed straight away. They both found it hilarious.\u0027They were quite concerned that the customers might notice but I said \u0027look, it\u0027s just chocolate sauce with ice cream\u0027.\u0027They weren\u0027t going to say anything if they don\u0027t realise what I\u0027ve done. And they didn\u0027t notice it, it was fine.\u0027We noticed it, but they didn\u0027t.

As she does her hair, standing with her back to him and us, naked except for a translucent green slip that half covers her buttocks, seamed stockings and shoes, he grins lasciviously, squeezing a phallic paint tube. A rag hangs from his pocket like a masturbatory spurt. What a degenerate.I mean that precisely. In 1937, Grosz, like many of the artists in Tate Modern’s often astonishing display of early 20th-century German art, had his works held up for mockery and revilement by the Nazis in their Munich exhibition Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art). Magic Realism, a free display that has the depth of an exhibition, complete with scholarly catalogue, uncovers what scared the Nazis about modern German art. The Degenerate Art exhibition is remembered today simply as an attack on modernism. However, that is a bloodless misunderstanding. The reason the Nazis called modern art degenerate is that avant garde works in Germany after the first world war really did revel in the perverse, the decadent, the depraved. This art was not abstract but fiercely carnal and it is still shocking today.Otto Dix’s 1922 watercolour Lustmord (Lust Murder) depicts a slavering Jack the Ripper figure with his tongue hanging out as he poses demonically by the woman he has killed. The artist relishes the contours of her corpse. Dix is the true murderer, for he has created this scene, his brush lingering over bloodstained flesh. This is not the only “lust murder” on show. An etching by Dix shows a crazed murderer surrounded by dismembered body parts. An eerie 1924 drawing by Rudolf Schlichter portrays the artist sitting and contemplating two dead women who hang from his ceiling. What sickened the imaginations of these artists? A touching early work by Dix reminds us of the horror they had endured. He was a machine gunner on the western front when he painted a portrait of his commanding officer, Bruno Alexander Roscher, in 1915. The story goes that it won him some welcome leave. Roscher’s face is like a piece of pink meat bulging out of his medal-bedecked uniform. Dix returned from the war with a terrible sense of the fragile flesh we are. He was to record what he saw in grisly prints featuring worm-infested skulls and bodies on barbed wire. His images of sexual violence could be understood as post-traumatic nightmares.Grosz makes the same confusion of war and civilian life, sex and death, explicit in his 1916 painting Suicide. A prostitute holds up a flower at a window as a young man lies dead in the street. The city night is lit up in the red of sex and blood. The jagged cubistic composition sends everything spinning off in fragments. Reality has been blown apart and death has poisoned desire.That mixing of Eros and Thanatos, sex and death, has shaped the image of decadence in art and literature, at least since Charles Baudelaire published his Les Fleurs du Mal poetry collection in 1857. The Weimar Republic – a fledgling German democracy established in 1919, only to be undermined by economic disaster and overrun by Hitler – has long been portrayed as decadent. Magic Realism does nothing to overturn the cabaret image – it even has a section called Cabaret. Yet the sensual, provocative art of Weimar’s jazz-filled nights is full of freedom and possibility as well as perversity and darkness.The biggest discovery here is Jeanne Mammen. Her images of Weimar women are liberated and hedonistic. Two, with sleek short hair, lounge while smoking and daydreaming in her 1929 watercolour Boring Dolls prostitutes are portrayed as defiant working women in her 1930 piece Free Room.The curators see her imagery as a riposte to the male artists in the show but, to me, she has much in common with Dix. In Circus, his series of etchings, gender fluidity abounds in a fantastic playground of sexual experiment. The lion-tamer is part man, part woman and part beast. She holds up a whip that seems aimed at the viewer of the image as much as any circus animal. Sailors and sex workers, acrobats and musicians populate this fascinating, fleshy art.“Magic realism” was coined by a Weimar critic to describe these rich and strange fusions of the real and fantastic. It is a good term to revive because for too long art history has tended to crush this raw genre with cold, technical language. This is the kind of display Tate Modern’s collections need – a truly revelatory voyage through art and history. It is a past that feels like our present, and the art here holds up a mad mirror to a mad world. It is degenerate with a vengeance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d72c8eb360979207c1ba6c58438e0336dda910d3/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64b6e3322706d838ac11f7ea1369dfe3","title":"follow new silk road china belt","story":"In the first part of a week-long series revealing the effects of China\u0027s Belt and Road Initiative on cities around the world, Jon Watts journeys from the steppes of Central Asia to the Black Sea and into Europe, as Beijing\u0027s grand plan radically remakes the lives of people in its pathThe Silk Road setting feels timeless: an expanse of desert scrub below the Tianshan Mountains, where weather-beaten farmers herd flocks of sheep much as their ancestors might have done in Marco Polo’s day.Rising up surreally in their midst, however, are the new landmarks of a modern development: the gleaming yellow gantries of the world’s biggest dry port and the shopping mall towers of a duty-free zone the size of a city.Welcome to Khorgos, China’s new land gateway to the mineral-rich resources of Central Asia and the consumer-rich markets of Europe. Further from the sea than almost anywhere on Earth, it is both the middle of nowhere and the centre of Beijing’s plans for a new world order.China is opening new commercial routes across Eurasia. The construction of a new network of Silk Roads – as well as railways, pipelines, ports and ferry routes – is part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.It is a vague concept, but there has been concrete progress. Next month Xi is due to open a China-to-Europe highway, which stretches 8,445 kilometres (5,247 miles) from the Yellow Sea to the Baltic. Last year, a new section of railway came into operation between Khorgos and Urumqi, the capital of China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Almost every week there is a new opening, unveiling or funding announcement.For those who fear China’s rise, the Belt and Road is terrifying. They worry Beijing will use trade routes to increase its influence and export an authoritarian brand of politics. Some have warned of an “infrastructure power grab” and a new Great Game, referring to the 19th century scheming as Britain and Russia vied for control of commerce between Europe and Asia.Others see Belt and Road as a boon that will redraw the world’s trade routes and turn peripheral countries and cities into hubs. Ancient routes are being rejuvenated, new ones opened, and cities are being built from scratch. visited three cities on the central corridor of the new Silk Road – Khorgos, Aktau and Anaklia – to find out how China’s grand plan is reshaping this often overlooked part of the world.“There’s China and there’s Kazakhstan,” says young trader Nurzaman Nurkadilov as he looks down at the border fence from the roof of his 20-storey hotel in the Khorgos special economic zone. “And there are shops, shops, shops. Nothing more. Nothing less. This will be the world’s biggest duty free.”He points out the dozen or so mega-malls – each the size of an airport terminal – that have risen from the desert in the past few years then the cluster of cranes building ever bigger emporiums: one topped with a yellow dome, another jagging up several dozen storeys in a Dragon’s Teeth design.“In a couple of months, my uncle is going to build a Happy Land theme park over there,” he says, gesturing towards the Kazakh side, where there are far fewer cranes, more empty plots and lower buildings.The disparity between the two sides of the city is unsurprising given Khorgos itself is a manifestation of political will and old school centralised planning. Although both countries are invested in the project, the one calling the shots is China (population 1.4 billion, GDP $11.2tn) rather than Kazakhstan (population 18 million, GDP $133bn). That imbalance is a source of concern but also a force many hope to tilt in their favour.Rauan Akkeshin, chief of staff of Khorgos International Centre of Boundary Cooperation, predicts a million people will move to the city on the Chinese side. He wants to lure tourists and businesspeople across the border into Kazakhstan with entertainment and conference facilities.He shows off tiny white plastic models of the planned circus, race track, water park, hotels and a conference centre where Chinese executives will be able to meet foreign partners without needing a passport.Despite doubts about the pace of progress and rumours of corruption that resulted in the fall of his predecessor, he says investors have committed money and the goal is to finish everything by 2022. “This place is already the centre of the Silk Road. At first the visitors were only Kazakhs. Now they come from all over Central Asia. In future, we hope they come from Europe.”Tourists clearly enjoy posing for selfies on the border line, where a single step over the red-blue ision on the road can take them across two time zones. But very few areas are bustling and some, such as the Yiwu mall on the far extreme of the neutral zone, are eerily empty.Chinese tourist Lanzhen Tang is unimpressed. “I like it but it’s a bit small. There aren’t many people,” she says before posing for photographs beside a stretch limousine.Traders say visitor numbers collapsed a couple of months ago after the Chinese tightened import controls and restricted the movement of people between the two sides. This was ostensibly done to crack down on corruption, but ethnic discrimination and political tension may be a bigger factor.On the walls of every shopping mall on the Chinese side are posters forbidding entry to any man with a long beard or any woman with a hijab. Visitors must pass through a metal detector and have their bag checked by security guards. On the streets outside, there are CCTV cameras and the police presence is striking. This is due to tensions in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Several cities there have witnessed ethnic riots, terrorist attacks and fierce repression by state security forces, who have blocked all public displays of Islamic faith.This threatens to undermine Khorgos. Most traders are Muslim and unhappy at restrictions on their co-religionists. As businessmen, they are also troubled by the frequent regulatory changes.It is clear China is calling the shots, but its heavy-handedness has not halted corruption. Businessmen in the neutral zone say they can bribe customs officials to ensure their goods get through, that illegal casinos and brothels operate inside the shells of half-completed buildings, and that there have been secret bare-knuckle boxing tournaments, where spectators could gamble on two teams formed of 10 Chinese and 10 Kazakh fighters.But Khorgos is more than a bizarre bazaar. The entire region around it is being transformed. Construction will soon begin on an airport. Work is already under way on an industrial centre, which will offer a rent holiday and zero taxation until 2035. Eventually the region’s planners hope to attract IT and robotics companies. By 2025, they aim to create 25,000 jobs.Zhasulan Khamzin cheerfully admits he had never heard of Khorgos before moving here five years ago to manage the world’s biggest dry port and the installation of three 41-tonne gantries to move containers across flatbed trains on the different gauge tracks on the two sides of the border. “We are developing an area where there was nothing before,” he says. “We are pioneers.”The first train passed through in July 2015. A year later, the facility handled 45,000 containers. This year, it is set to exceed 150,000. Meanwhile, a new dormitory town – Nurkent – has been built from scratch and is home to 4,000 families. Khamzin predicts this too will become a city.“Nurkent is still just a baby, but it will grow. This will be one of the biggest cities in Kazakhstan. By 2035, we expect 100,000 people will live here,” he says.The climate is not exactly welcoming. In winter, residents put up with thick snow and temperatures as low as -36C (-32F). In summer, they bake in 40C (104F) heat. But relatively high salaries, no tax and free accommodation are bringing people in.“I didn’t want to come but I had no choice, because my previous company went out of business,” says crane operator Osipova Galina, as she sits down after a 12-hour shift. “My first impression wasn’t good. Just very ugly shopping malls surrounded by a barbed wire fence.”But she has warmed to this place on the corridor into central Asia. “The people here are very committed. They are invested in this,” she says.As the sleeper train clunks slowly out of Khorgos, passengers watch the evening sun dip below the dunes. Almost all are small-scale traders and shoppers, making the journey from the megamalls on the border to their home towns.The train trundles overnight to Almaty, once the capital of Kazakhstan. From here, people and goods are sucked away in a spaghetti of directions. The architects of the New Silk Road are working to upgrade three main routes: north, through Russia southwest through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Iran and – most direct but complex of all – due west along a central corridor that passes for more than 1,500km across the vast deserts of central Kazakhstan to the Caspian Sea port of Aktau and beyond.During the Cold War, this Soviet-era port city was shrouded in military secrecy. Built by prisoners in the 1950 and 60s, it was initially little more than a barracks and a uranium mine. That legacy is still apparent in the garrison-like housing blocks in the centre, an MiG fighter plane that seems about to fly off from a marble plinth, and the grimly contaminated Lake Koshkar-Ata on the outskirts, where farmers take horses and camels to drink despite radiation hazard signs and a stream of stinking black effluent pouring from an industrial complex. On windy days, contaminated particles blow into the city, which is home to 178,000 people.Over the past 30 years, Aktau has opened up and the focus has shifted to oil production. Belt and Road is seen by the Kazakh government as an opportunity to accelerate the city’s rebirth as a logistics hub, tourist resort and conference centre.City planners want to clean up the lake and plant rows of trees to hold back the dust, but progress has been slow. Russian influence is still strong here, but Chinese companies have invested in oil fields and a bitumen plant, which supplies the needs of the growing number of Silk Road highway upgrades.The first consignment from Khorgos to Europe passed through earlier this year. It was a container of tomatoes, farmed in Xinjiang, and sent to a paste processing plant in Italy. Last month, there was another first when a consignment of cars passed through on a journey from Chongqing via Khorgos to Iran. It took just 14 days.“We can do it in half the time it previously took,” says Martin Voetmann, who heads the Aktau Port operation for logistics company DP World. “If we had sent it by the regular sea route, it would have taken 40 to 45 days.”Although it is the shortest distance across Eurasia, the central corridor of the Silk Road requires multi-modal shifts between trains and ships, and the bureaucracy of border checks in at least five countries. The old Soviet ferries which ply the Caspian are not made for modern container lorries. There is no timetable. Both cargo and people can wait more than a week for passage, which takes another 20 to 40 hours depending on weather.The high expectations of China are shared by senior figures in business and politics in Tblisi. Ketevan Bochorishvili, a former Georgian vice minister of economy, hopes Beijing will push forward with a $2.5bn plan to build a deep sea port at Anaklia on the Black Sea coast.The scheme has been in limbo for most of the past 10 years, but she says the Belt and Road Initiative has nudged it close to reality. A new free-trade agreement with China came into force this year, and last month Bochorishvili signed a memorandum of understanding with a Hong Kong logistics firm.Anaklia is currently little more than a village. Cows and pigs wander across the single-lane access road. In September, the UK consultancy Buro-Happold will present a masterplan for a free industrial zone and city at Anaklia. Work is already under way to clear the site of the planned new city – an area of marsh and dunes patrolled by security guards on horseback, whose main role is to fend off invading cattle.The project has been briefly held up by unexploded Russian bombs, which had to be dismantled and removed – a reminder of recent conflicts with the breakaway region of Abkhazia. A major Silk Road project in this troubled region would be a geostrategic boost for Georgia, which pitches itself as the most democratic and market-friendly of the former Soviet states.If the project comes off, Anaklia will be the yang to Khorgos’s yin, the western gateway on the shortest overland route between China and Europe. “It will be a mix of Khorgos and Dubai but with the climate of California,” says Bochorishvili.There are still many ifs in these three New Silk Road cities – one embryonic, one hoping to be reborn and the other created out of nothing – but their architects feel the long-term trends may be in their favour.The material impact on global trade should not be overstated – it will never compare to the shipping industry – but the political ramifications are significant.In many ways the New Silk Road is typical of the Old Silk Road, which has usually been an east-west flow of goods and people, with heavy restrictions in the opposition direction. The exception was during the 13th century, when the Mongols briefly unified the Eurasian landmass and opened up the west-east path for European traders. That allowed Marco Polo to make his famous 24-year round-trip to China.He returned to Venice with silk, spices and incredible tales of the cities he visited. “I have not told half of what I saw for I knew I would not be believed,” he said. He might say the same of claims made for the New Silk Road – but the journey would certainly be shorter.Design and Development by: Frank Hulley-Jones and Garry Blight"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/912ce6518db84abe47a6ed7fea053e07b2cadb5c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f17556b9ee7090d64a7c3ae92de0d0","title":"headline shows the seven greatest music venues in the us","story":"From Madison Square Garden out east to the west’s Hollywood Bowl, via New Orleans blues bars and secret Joshua Tree saloons, visit the most important musical addresses in the USConsidering its totemic role in the creation of virtually every form of popular music we listen to today – from hip-hop, R\u0026ampB and soul to house, hardcore punk and good, plain old classic rock – it should come as a surprise to no one that the US is home to a huge share of the world’s most storied music venues.Some of them are famous for their size, scale and setting, while others have entered the popular consciousness for their part in the history and development of certain styles of music. Some of them, too, are sadly no longer with us, such as New York’s CBGB, or may not count as music venues in the formal sense at all – the street corners of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Compton and suburban Atlanta that gave birth to hip-hop come to mind. Whatever your taste or level of music-nerdery may be, one thing is for sure: the seven venues below have all at some point provided the setting for significant moments in US cultural history.To New Yorkers, Madison Square Garden holds a singular place in the city’s imagination. Known to them simply as “the Garden”, this 20,000 capacity venue describes itself, modestly, as “the most famous arena in the world”. Ordinarily, such a claim would hardly be credible but, in the case of Madison Square Garden, it’s more than justified. Consider this: since the current arena opened its doors in 1968 – there had been three previous public venues occupying the same site since 1879 – the Garden has hosted a number of the greatest shows in the history of popular music, including George Harrison’s Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 Parliament Funkadelic’s legendary sold-out shows of 1977 and 1978 and, more recently, LCD Soundsystem’s final (or, as it turned out, not so final) show in 2011, which was released the following year as the groundbreaking concert film Shut Up and Play the Hits. It might also be worth mentioning that while the Garden doesn’t have an official house act, that bloke from across the Hudson who goes by the name of Bruce Springsteen has played the venue no less than 47 times. The most famous arena in the world? They’re probably right.If Madison Square Garden is the premier indoor concert venue in the US, then Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre would have to be its most spectacular outdoor musical locale. Framed by an enormous angled rock on one side, with stunning views of the rugged mountain terrain on the other, Red Rocks’ unparalleled outdoor setting has been used to a striking effect in concert films over the years, including U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky and Neil Young’s Red Rocks Live. With a capacity of almost 10,000, the otherworldly arena has also hosted legendary performances by REM, Stevie Nicks and, on what must have been a particularly psychedelic night in 1968, Jimi Hendrix and the Soft Machine. This year, its programme of events includes appearances by Jackson Browne, Seal and the Colorado Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as every rapper’s favourite rapper, that inimitable Brooklyn native, Nas.Instantly recognisable for its “shell” of concentric arches over the stage, the Hollywood Bowl is to Angelenos what Madison Square Garden is to New Yorkers. Set in the bowels of the Hollywood Hills – with the Hollywood sign perched not far off in the background – the list of notable pop and rock performances here is too exhaustive to detail, hosting over the years the Beatles, the Doors (both of whom recorded live albums at the site), Kraftwerk, Prince, Black Sabbath and Dolly Parton. But the 17,500 capacity venue isn’t just famous for its live shows this being Hollywood, it has also featured as a location in films as varied as Some Kind of Wonderful, Beaches and Escape From LA.Perhaps no other continuously operating venue in the US has such a mythical status for its role in the history and development of one style of music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. All of the greats (and by that we do mean all) recorded and performed here over the years: Coltrane, Davis, Mingus, Monk, Rollins, Evans, Brubeck, Baker … the list goes on. And for this reason, the Village Vanguard might just be the No 1 place of pilgrimage for jazz lovers in the world. But it is by no means for jazz buffs alone this intimate, 120-seat venue offers an authentic taste of an older New York – as a much a place to sit back with a good martini, take in the portraits of the legends that line the walls and imagine the curlicues of smoke that once rose from the tables and gave this tiny basement club the hazy ambience that jazz venues the world over have sought to replicate.If Nashville is the home of country music, then the closest thing it has to an exact address would be 2,804 Opryland Drive, where you’ll find Grand Ole Opry – a venue that holds roughly the same significance for lovers of country music as the Village Vanguard does for jazz. But the Grand Ole Opry is a little bit more than a music venue: taking its name from the weekly concert radio performance, it is also the longest radio broadcast in US history, having first hit the airwaves in 1925, moving between Nashville locations before finally settling in its current, purpose-built venue in 1974. The great names of country and western, from Johnny Cash to Loretta Lynn, and Garth Brooks to Patsy Cline, have all been regulars at the Opry, and some 215 acts have held a coveted Opry membership (a sure sign that you’ve “made it” as a country star) at some point in their careers.Possibly the coolest venue in the US that you’ve never heard of, Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s is a dusty saloon bar located in the depths of California’s cowboy country, on the fringe of Joshua Tree national park. The stature and notoriety of Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s has grown rapidly in recent years, since becoming the venue of choice for many an artist booked at the nearby Coachella festival to play a secret little show of their own on the side. Queens of the Stone Age, Spiritualized, Sonic Youth, Lorde and – pause – Paul McCartney have all passed through for a jam at some point. Oh, and it’s also home to a fully preserved cowboy and western film set out the back, complete with the facades of a local bank, chapel and saloon, which served as the location for dozens of films and television programmes in its 1950s heyday.No list of the US’s great music venues would be complete without at least one entry from New Orleans – and given that it is the home of the legendary Preservation Hall, competition was stiff. But we all know that they do things a little bit differently south of the Mason-Dixon line, and nowhere down south does that hold truer than in New Orleans, so it only seems fitting to choose Kermit’s Treme Mother-in-Law Lounge – one of the most magnificently eccentric music spots in the city. Set up by 60s R\u0026ampB legend and self-proclaimed “emperor of the universe” Ernie K-Doe, the lounge hosts local jazz, funk and legendarily swampy Louisiana blues performances week in, week out, and is as famous for the mind-bending murals that adorn its exterior walls as it is for its raucous shows and southern soul food.United Airlines flies from four UK airports to key US hubs, with onward connections to more than 280 destinations across the Americas.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each?

Your peers don’t wait, the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.”Children with a poor vocabulary aged five are more than twice as likely to be unemployed at age 34 as children with good vocabulary, research shows. Announcing an education summit this autumn to encourage parents to get involved in their children’s language development from an early age, Hinds will say: “The home learning environment can be, understandably, the last taboo in education policy – but we can’t afford to ignore it when it comes to social mobility.“I don’t have any interest in lecturing parents here. I know it’s parents who bring up their children, who love them, who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children. But that doesn’t mean extra support and advice can’t be helpful.”The summit will bring together businesses, charities, tech companies and media groups to encourage more parents to read and learn new words with their children. Hinds will say: “Whilst there are legitimate worries about screen time, media and modern technology can also help to raise awareness and build parents’ confidence around what they can do to help their child’s early language development.”The announcement builds on £20m pledged to narrow the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers. However, Labour said the government figures showed that inequality across the education system was rising, with the most vulnerable children the worst affected.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “The measure of our education system should be the support that it offers to the most vulnerable children, and the steps we take to level the playing field between them and their more affluent peers. Quite simply, the Conservatives are failing this test.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f59b075b51d0fe4e9f261c482979715f7496a025/0_0_7160_4296/master/7160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7df3a066c87337ad2abb82f40ef8904","title":"this one has heat stress the shocking reality of live animal exports","story":"The global demand for meat means more animals are moved around the world than ever before. Activists say the conditions they endure are intolerable – and we are all turning a blind eyeAt the Kapikule border crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, Lesley Moffat charges forward, clipboard in hand, marching alongside the parked lorries loaded with live cows and sheep waiting in this no man’s land to be exported from the EU. Sometimes, the animals are left on the lorries for days, stuck inside metallic freight containers barely shielded from the blinding sun as truckers, bureaucrats, importers and exporters haggle over paperwork and fees.The cows struggle to bring their heads close to the fresh air. Their containers are filled with urine and manure, levels of ammonia steadily rising inside the trailers as journeys wear on. Moffat – the founder of the Dutch-based charity Eyes on Animals – sticks her hand through the grating of one lorry to check the animals’ water supply. “Look at this,” she says, grabbing at the hay stuck into the water trough and pointing to the dung clogging it. “It gets full of dirty straw and shit, and they can never drink from it,” she says. “The drivers need to give them water in buckets.”She whips out an electronic thermometer holstered in her satchel and sticks it through the grates. She notes the temperature – over 30C, higher than EU regulations – and jots it down on her checklist as she moves from truck to truck, petting some of the distressed animals on their snouts and even pouring water out of her own bottle for the parched cows. “This one is showing signs of heat stress – its tongue is rolling,” she says, pointing to a cow inside one of the trucks.For years, she says, authorities have promised to build a shaded grazing area for animals waiting at the border, even showing plans for where the facility is meant to go up. But nothing has happened. “Every year, it’s the same situation here,” she says. “Trucks are arriving when it’s over 30C, even though that’s illegal. There’s just one fire hydrant, no shade, no infrastructure, trucks waiting in the sun all day.”Demand for meat is rising all over the world, even as the industry faces challenges from animal-rights activists and burgeoning vegetarian and vegan lifestyles in the west. The live export business is thriving. At every moment of the day, animals are being moved huge distances across the planet’s surface. Horses from the US are packed on to transport trucks and sent to be slaughtered in Mexico. Pigs from Canada endure icy temperatures as they wait for long periods at the US frontier. Livestock from central Europe is trucked to the farthest reaches of Russia, where they are slaughtered, fattened or bred. Cows from Australia, Uruguay and Argentina are loaded on to ships and endure weeks-long trips to the Middle East.The trade makes economic sense, catering to people, such as those in Turkey, who are willing to pay a premium for imported meats because they consume far more than they produce. Live animal exports reduce the need to install expensive equipment to keep meat frozen. The EU imports large amounts of fruit and vegetables, and live animal exports help to plug the trade gap.What’s more, butchers in Muslim countries demand newly slaughtered lamb and beef. “It has to do with the meat consumption culture,” says Jean-Luc Mériaux, the secretary general of the European Livestock and Meat Trades Union (UECBV), a Brussels-based lobbying group that argues the export trade makes an important contribution to the EU’s economy. “They’re looking for very fresh meat, they eat it immediately after the slaughtering. And if we don’t supply the cattle, someone else will – maybe Brazil, Uruguay or Australia.”But the trade raises some uncomfortable ethical questions. Here at the TurkeyBulgaria border, the bottleneck where so many animals leave the EU for Turkey and the Middle East, many of the cows are crammed into quarters so tight that they are unable to lie down. Eerily, few of them moo, a possible sign of exhaustion. One cow is bleeding from a raw stump where her horn caught in the railing of the truck and was ripped off.Moffat is a blur of activity here, talking to truck drivers, trying to offer care for the animals as much as she is able. When she spots a newborn calf in distress (the calf was probably born in transit), she summons a vet from the nearby city of Edirne in north-west Turkey and pays for medical treatment.Moffat is the granddaughter of cattle farmers in Ontario. They treated their 40 or so cows well, but as a child she watched as global agribusiness moved in and set up industrial conditions for livestock that she considered unbearable for the animals and unhealthy for people consuming their meat. “I learned about factory farming as a 12-year-old,” she says. “It made me an activist right away.”Now, she physically chases down traders and trucks, often trailing cars for miles, keeping track of how they treat the animals under their care. Her scariest experience came in 2005, while monitoring a businessman in rural Belgium. She was watching him load donkeys on to a truck from across a field. He spotted her. She ran back to her car and he followed with a baseball bat, which he used to smash her car. She sped away with the man in pursuit. “I’ve never driven so fast,” she says. “I was going through these tiny towns at 180kmh.” She finally parked in front of a cafe and called out for help.Most encounters are far less confrontational. During the hours we spend at the border, several truckers whom Moffat awakens from their naps agree to turn on the fans installed inside the trailers when she points out the temperatures. Others promise to water the animals while waiting for customs papers to come through. Moffat is sympathetic to the plight of the drivers, many of whom would be working in agricultural jobs were it not for the rise of industrial farming. Many of the truckers voice sympathy for the animals and seem eager to cooperate.“They’re not the ones with the big money,” she says. “They’re not the bosses. They’re forced to drive really long hours, long distances alone, which is illegal, but saves the boss money.”This is just one of the frontlines on which activists around the world have fought for years. In the 90s, widespread protests in the UK dominated the press. In 1995, a 31-year-old animal rights activist, Jill Phipps, was crushed to death by a lorry during a protest against export of live calves to the Netherlands. The subject has come to the fore because of the Brexit discussions, with Michael Gove, the UK’s environment secretary, consulting on banning livestock exports after the country leaves the EU. It is a move that would not be allowed under EU trading rules. New Zealand has been operating a de facto ban on exports for slaughter since 2003, while activists in Australia are now seeking a ban after using undercover footage to expose the abuses they say go on inside the ships carrying farm animals for slaughter around the world. Cows, they say, are held in containers that fill up with tens of thousands of litres of urine and faeces during hot, weeks-long journeys.Animal rights advocates insist the trade in live animals is unnecessary and that animals should be raised closer to where they are eaten, or slaughtered and exported as frozen carcasses. “We want to end this cruel and completely outdated trade,” says Reineke Hameleers, the director of Eurogroup for Animals. “Animals are not goods. They are beings.” Jørn Dohrmann, a Danish member of the European parliament who is serving as rapporteur on live animal exports, says the EU should refuse to sell animals to countries when they might be subjected to abuse.Activists say that guidelines laid down by the EU and member states are quickly discarded from the moment animals are herded on to lorries or ships operated by giant firms. “They can’t move,” says Francesca Porta, of Eurogroup for Animals. “If they fall down, they cannot get up. They are exhausted because the length of journey is very long. They don’t have water, feed, or resting time. For unweaned animals in particular, the mortality rate is high.” The EU is keenly aware of the controversy and is preparing an assessment of how its rules are being implemented, which should be ready by January 2019. Dohrmann travelled to Turkey this month to see the treatment of animals at the border. “I think the European commission is weak on this question,” he says. “You have 28 different set of rules they are not implemented in the same way in each country.”The UECBV insists that the industry abides by strict national and European commission legal requirements, while acknowledging occasional “shortcomings” and room for improvement. Mériaux says companies that don’t abide by the rules are not able to operate. “Try to load a truck in France or Ireland in the summer and you will not get permission to go to Turkey because the temperatures are too high,” he says. “You are told to wait a couple of weeks.”Industry advocates even argue that the activists’ actions lead to unintended consequences. Kirk Leech, executive director of the London-based advocacy group the European Animal Research Association, cites the example of a Dutch company forced to use a rusting, dilapidated Russian tank ferry to move sheep from the coast of Kent to France for halal slaughter because no other shipping firm will move live animals.“Because the activists made a big campaign about this, they have forced potentially better transport providers such as Eurotunnel not to touch it,” he says. “Eurotunnel moves tanks, alcohol and cigarettes, but they won’t touch animals for food consumption or research purposes because they fear the reputational consequences.”Only Air France and a few charter planes will fly live animals for research or consumption. Leech cites the case of live animals that needed to travel 300km within Portugal from Lisbon to Porto, but had to be flown via Frankfurt, putting additional stress on the creatures, because the Portuguese national carrier refuses to carry research animals.Moffat is familiar with these arguments. She admits that sometimes they win and sometimes they lose. “You’ve got to start somewhere, and when it gets cleaned up in one area, it gets a little dirtier in the other area,” she says. She is not about to give up any time soon, though. “It doesn’t matter that these animals are ultimately headed for slaughter,” she says. “Anything that has the desire to live and feels pain we should think twice about making suffer. I see it as enlarging the circle of compassion to include all things that feel pain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ca0f2f97d9c0c3224ce490c959015e6cf684b22/0_83_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f9727d9f702c659c2dd83c84d72d7c96 960w","title":"mission impossible tom cruise reliable franchise","story":"Critical adoration and box office success has met the sixth installment of Tom Cruise’s series, an unlikely 22-year phenomenon that shows no signs of tiringLet’s take a moment to appreciate the preposterousness of Mission: Impossible. Not the rubber masks or the exploding gum sticks or the nuclear countdown clocks that always stop with one second till death. (“The usual,” Ving Rhames’ Luther Stickell would shrug.) All franchises have their implausibilities, whether it’s Transformers’ sentient cars or the Fast and Furious’ sentient Vin Diesels. But only the Mission: Impossible franchise has gotten better reviews with every installment, climbing its way up the Rotten Tomatoes rankings as though wearing electromagnetic gloves. Bruce Willis can’t make a good Die Hard happen. But this weekend, Mission: Impossible – Fallout had the best critical approval of Tom Cruise’s entire career, better even than the three films that scored him Oscar nominations, and his second-highest box office opening ever, just under 2005’s War of the Worlds. Fallout probably would have beaten that, too, if MoviePass hadn’t glitched.Kudos to Cruise for making the most of a career he never meant to have. Mission: Impossible is also an outlier on his resume. Before he became Ethan Hunt, Cruise refused to shoot a gun or a sequel. In the 80s, he turned down Top Gun 2 to make The Color of Money and Rain Man. “There was no room for a sequel,” he shrugged. For the first decade of his movie stardom, he chased Oscars, not villains, and if his characters wrestled anything, it was their own guilt and privilege. As an actor, that was all Cruise needed. But when he formed CruiseWagner Productions in the 90s and decided to produce his own movies, he needed a hit.“I’d been looking for an action movie,” said Cruise. Back then, that meant mimicking Stallone, Schwarzenegger or Seagal. Macho meathead stuff wasn’t him. Instead, he had a brainstorm. Cruise remembered Mission: Impossible, one of his favorite childhood TV shows, where the heroes used their brains, not bullets. When he first pitched the idea to Paramount in 1992, the studio did a double-take. “People looked at me a little cross-eyed because it was a TV series and at that time people weren’t really doing that,” said Cruise. They would – for good and bad – thanks to him.Cruise took more risks. He hired Brian De Palma to direct, a wicked genius who’d never made a blockbuster hit, and instead of rebooting the series with himself as original star Jim Phelps, he turned Phelps into the villain. One of the television show cast members was so offended by an evil Phelps that he stormed out of the theater. Audiences, however, were hooked on Ethan Hunt, who dangled, slid into disguises, nearly got his neck sliced by a helicopter blade. And as a producer, Cruise didn’t just wrap Mission: Impossible on-time and on-budget – he finished it under-time and under-budget.Mission: Impossible had a stunt man, though you rarely saw him on-screen. Cruise had his guy run through the routines to map out the dangers. “He’d give me a scale of how painful it was going to be,” said Cruise. “Then I’d jump in and get the final pounding.” They kept things low-fi, shunning excess CG. When Cruise kept losing his balance on a jump, he simply shifted the weight in his shoes by slipping pound coins underneath his socks. Today, the stunts are as big of a selling point as Tom Cruise. Teenagers have never been alive to see Cruise lose an Academy Award – they know him as that dude clinging to the outside of a plane. At first, film fans enjoyed watching Cruise execute challenges perfectly. By the fourth film, we liked to see him get banged up. Cruise not only broke his ankle leaping across a building in Mission: Impossible – Fallout – he kept that take in the film.In 2011’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, nothing works, not even that infamous electromagnetic glove. Groaned Ethan: “The only thing that functioned properly on that mission was this team.” True. Cruise had buffeted Hunt with interesting directors – De Palma, John Woo, JJ Abrams, Brad Bird – and a band of actors able to share his heavy lifting: Simon Pegg did the jokes, Ving Rhames brought the legacy, and Cruise momentarily seemed ready to hand off the franchise to Jeremy Renner. After all, he was creeping close to the other side of the insult in the first Mission: Impossible when a younger Ethan joked that Jon Voight’s Jim Phelps “was getting soft in his old age”.If there’s a seventh Mission: Impossible, Cruise will be older than Voight. He’s not getting soft. And he’s definitely not quitting the series that’s let him prove he’s still the closest thing to a movie star we’ve got in 2018. There’s a sense each Mission: Impossible film is a Hail Mary making up for the public mistakes that threatened to derail his career in his very bad PR summer of 2005. But that was 13 years ago, and anyway, that derailment never happened. War of the Worlds, his No 1 box office smash, hit theaters two months after that supposedly disastrous Oprah appearance. All that’s been derailed is Cruise’s 80s dreams of being respected as a serious actor, not a stunt man. But as long as a new, and predictably terrific Mission: Impossible keeps arriving in theaters to big money and beaming reviews, Cruise will keep limping happily to the medicine cabinet for more bandages.

Even for a manager whose media appearances are often outspoken, the comments were extraordinary. He confessed disquiet at handing Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, a list of five players for “two new signings” and being unsure if even one of these will arrive by 9 August when the window closes.Mourinho also declared he would not have paid to see the Liverpool game despite it being between English football’s fiercest rivals and so a centrepiece fixture of the International Champions Cup, a lucrative summer money-spinner. This came after a huge 101,254 were attracted to the University of Michigan Stadium, United having played to near half‑empty stadiums in previous outings against Club América, San Jose Earthquakes and Milan. So how the Glazers, United’s American profit-led owners, view their manager effectively warning fans against attending the final tour match against Real Madrid in Miami on Wednesday should be clear.He was not finished yet. How could Alexis Sánchez be “very happy with the players around him”, the 55-year-old asked in a crushing dismissal of younger squad members he is supposedly developing as future United footballers.Mourinho then rounded on his captain Antonio Valencia for being unfit, the want-away Anthony Martial for not rushing back to the tour following the birth of his child, plus – oddly – the referee and assistants being sourced from “baseball”. There has also been continual moaning about starting the trip without 13 frontline players due to post-World Cup holidays.In all of this there is a near mirror image of previous Mourinho third‑term travails when twice at Chelsea (2004-07 and 2013-15) and Real Madrid (2010-13). Meanwhile the summer has seen only one major outfield signing in Brazil reserve midfielder Fred plus the untested 19-year-old full-back Diogo Dalot. Mourinho may have taken United to second place last year, a best finish since the 2012-13 title win, but they trailed by a record 19 points behind Manchester City. United were never serious challengers so what Mourinho must deliver in 2018-19 is clear: the chasm to Pep Guardiola’s men must be bridged and United must still be in the championship race come next May. In this context Mourinho’s media performance in Michigan can be viewed as a quasi-desperate roll of a dice to try to hurry Woodward into securing at least one of his centre-back and wide-forward preferences – and the preparing of ground should he not.If there are echoes of classic third-term Mourinho, the difference this time is that his predicament is precarious. In both Chelsea tenures and in Madrid, Mourinho began year three with his stock sky-high as the league title had been claimed the previous seasons.This summer his status at United is close to slipping terminally unless the side starts the season flying and continues through winter and spring. His words in Michigan followed the defeatist assessment earlier last week that United will struggle to defeat Leicester City and Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion in their opening two Premier League matches due to players having a shorter pre-season. Yet he omitted to mention Leicester have been seriously weakened by losing their best player, Riyad Mahrez, to City.An irony for Mourinho is that he enjoys more autonomy at Old Trafford than he did at either Chelsea or Real. Woodward might not sign off every transfer request – Internazionale’s Ivan Perisic and Chelsea’s Willian may be a difficult ask at their asking price due to them being 29 – but Mourinho does not have to resist pressure regarding players foisted on him.This was the situation at Chelsea and Real. In December 2006 Mourinho insisted he would never feel moved to play Andriy Shevchenko, who was viewed as a £30.8m vanity project of the owner, Roman Abramovich. His exit by “mutual consent” after limping into the September of his fourth year can be traced back to Shevchenko’s arrival with Michael Ballack also seemingly joining above his head.A memorable soundbite came just before that departure in a barb about how Abramovich’s transfer policy prevented the buying of elite players. “Some are more expensive than others and give you better omelettes,” he said. “So when the class one eggs are in Waitrose and you cannot go there you have a problem.”At Real, where the president often acts as a de facto director of football, similar issues arose. Mourinho signed a new four-year deal in summer 2012 after guiding the club to a record La Liga triumph. Yet the following campaign would prove the “worst of my career”, he said. There had been bust-ups with club favourites Iker Casillas and Cristiano Ronaldo and by May 2013 Real had lost the title to Barcelona by 15 points, were knocked out of the Champions League semi‑finals, and endured defeat against Atlético Madrid in the Copa del Rey final.His second Chelsea stint ended in similar fashion. The agreement of a new four-year contract on 7 August 2015 was followed the next day with a furious dispute with club doctor, Eva Carneiro, over her treatment of Eden Hazard during the season opener against Swansea City.While Mourinho and Chelsea later settled with Carneiro regarding an unfair dismissal claim, that December he was sacked, clearing the way for his appointment at United two years ago. Since then there have been 10 major signings granted by Woodward and the Glazers. When compared to Guardiola’s 13 for a City squad that was of higher quality than United’s when the Catalan took over, Mourinho may have a point regarding transfer policy.Yet United have twice eclipsed City’s record £60m outlay on Mahrez – for Romelu Lukaku (£75m) and Paul Pogba (£89.3m) – and while the board continue to back Mourinho there is bemusement at their manager’s off-message diatribes.If the question is posed what Guardiola could do with the same squad as Mourinho – surely better than trailing by 19 points – the crux of what is fuelling the latter’s serial moaning may become clearer. This is the sneaking suspicion that United are about to fall further behind when Mourinho’s third Old Trafford season starts. And that the once “Special One” has become the “Powerless One” regarding his ability to duke it out at the very top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/475a0805ce8e19b315a1eb5c634f319ddaa10e91/66_266_2940_1764/master/2940.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f6a639733a5c12388a214e34a61ae9","title":"sadio mane liverpool klopp","story":"• Jürgen Klopp hopes to agree new contract with forward• No plans to bring anyone else in before transfer deadlineJürgen Klopp is confident that Sadio Mané will soon complete a hat-trick of Liverpool forwards who have committed their long-term futures to Anfield.Liverpool have secured Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino with new five-year contracts in recent months that have doubled their salaries and the club are in regular dialogue with Mané’s representatives about the Senegal international following suit.The 26-year-old has three years remaining on the contract he signed when joining Liverpool from Southampton in 2016 but Anfield officials want to reward the striker’s progress in line with Klopp’s stance on Firmino and Salah. The manager believes the optimism around Anfield will play a part in convincing Mané to extend his\u0026nbspcontract.Klopp said: “When I speak about the good mood in the club, that is not only in the stands. We are Liverpool as a team and the boys want to be part of it. That’s really cool and it’s a big achievement for the club because these boys, Bobby Firmino, Mo Salah and Sadio Mané, and a lot of the others as well, could play for pretty much any team in the world. That’s how it is and a good sign for the club that they want\u0026nbspto stay. It is an improved situation that these players don’t use us and then go. It’s cool but now we all together have to deliver. Sign your contracts but now, go again – play and fight, run and shoot, all that stuff. That’s football.”Klopp has repeatedly stated there will be no more incomings before the transfer deadline despite having lined up a £53m move for Nabil Fekir earlier in the summer. The Lyon captain, whose proposed deal fell through on medical grounds, was earmarked as another creative option following Philippe Coutinho’s departure to Barcelona in January. Klopp, however, believes the second half of last season confirmed Liverpool had moved on without the Brazil international and that a straight replacement for Coutinho does not exist.“You cannot replace Phil Coutinho with exactly the same kind of player,” Klopp said. “He’s Phil Coutinho. He has a specific style of play, tactically an outstanding player, can play as the wing, the 10, the eight – really great. I don’t want to put one of my players in the position where people will say constantly, ‘He’s the Phil replacement.’“We don’t need to replace Phil. We need to make a squad for the next year. Out there on the market, there isn’t a Phil Coutinho-light. It’s not there. But there are a lot of good players and we have brought a few of them in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2753c2dbd8a4801bdcfb698effd1dd2a433d8f20/0_903_8010_4808/master/8010.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77bc06e133e9824f8bbc4bae264b3c6d","title":"rachel roddy recipe almond basil tomato pesto","story":"Tomatoes make pesto alla trapanese a softer sauce than its Ligurian cousin, and is perfect draped around ribbon pastaFor years I made pesto using an immersion blender. This was fine when I still had the tall, narrow container that made the push-plunge easy less so when, after the death of that container, I was trying to blend in bowls and jars. One attempt at making a sauce version of ajo blanco, ending in a flying bowl and bent blade, convinced me that if I was going to continue reducing nuts and herbs into sauce quickly, I needed another appliance. So four weeks ago I went to an elettrodomestici in Testaccio and bought myself a little blender that looks like a cross between a UFO and a model of a building in Brasilia. It is basic – a plastic bowl with a nifty blade and a plunging top that you press like a salad spinner. It is also a whizz. I have been using it with an enthusiasm and devotion I haven’t felt since I got a pair of hair crimpers in 1984.My new blender sits on the work surface under the cupboard, which contains dried things and nuts, and near the sink, where there is usually a (lately wilting) basil plant, which means I barely need move to make the recipe of the moment: pesto alla trapanese. Pesto simply means “pounded sauce”, the most famous of which is alla genovese – the basil, pine nut, pecorino pesto from Genova in Liguria. The food writer Fabrizia Lanza notes “only Ligurians follow strict rules when making pesto to everyone else, pesto is subjective”. For the most part, I agree, although I have met a Trapanese who is just as single-minded about their pesto of almonds, garlic, basil, tomatoes and olive oil, which is as it should be. It is wonderful to know the origins of recipes, especially when they are steeped in history and tradition, providing a portal into a culture and way of life. It is also wonderful to take ingredients as good as almonds, aromatic basil and tomatoes, garlic and as much olive oil as you see fit and to combine them until the taste and texture is pleasing to you. As my friend Itamar says: “Life is complicated cooking shouldn’t be” ... at least not most of the time.It was in Fabrizia’s kitchen near Vallelunga in the belly of Sicily that I first ate pesto alla trapanese. It was made by Fabrizia’s kitchen right arm, an exceptional cook called Enza (whose aubergine I will be writing about next week). Enza’s pesto alla trapanese is a soft, gloopy sauce, but has texture and is speckled with red and green, and tastes like an assertive basil pesto softened by almonds, with a garlic kick (whether that is a one-, two- or three-clove kick is up to you). The pleasure is in not really measuring: a big handful of basil leaves, another of almonds, one or two cloves of garlic, a pinch of salt and a good amount of olive oil (say, 120ml), which is then blended in your appliance of choice (or mortar) until it resembles a coarse rubble. Add three peeled tomatoes, then blend everything again until fairly smooth and creamy. As always, taste and adjust before tossing though pasta.A Sicilian pasta shape called busiate – long ringlets like ribbon round a maypole – is ideal for pesto alla trapanese otherwise fusilli, caserecce spaghetti or simply the packet that is nearest to the nuts in the cupboards. The tomato means the pesto is loose, but may still benefit from a splash of pasta cooking water. If you would like cheese on top, salted ricotta or pecorino work. The day we had pesto alla trapanese at Fabrizia’s, Enza also made some courgettes, sliced to a few millimetres thick, brushed with olive oil and cooked on a ridged griddle until soft and golden, then dusted with salted ricotta. Whether you want a few courgettes on top, beside your pasta or after as another course is subjective.For the pestoA medium bunch of basil (about 70g)100g blanched almonds1–3 garlic clovesSalt150ml olive oil300g ripe tomatoes, peeled500g dried pasta (e.g. busiate, caserecce, spaghetti)For the courgettes3 medium courgettes, sliced on an angleOlive oilPecorino, salted ricotta or parmesanFirst, make the pesto: pull the leaves from the basil and put it into a food processor with the almonds, garlic, a pinch of salt and olive oil. Blend until you have a coarse paste. Add the tomatoes and blend again until you have the consistency you like. Taste and add salt as needed.Bring a large pan of water to a boil, add salt, stir, and then add the pasta and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, cut the courgettes into 5mm-thick slices, on an angle if they are small so as to get longer slices.Heat a ridged griddle, rub the slices with olive oil and grill first on one side, then the other, until soft and embossed with golden colour. You may like to brush them with more oil as you go. Lift the griddled slices on to a plate and sprinkle with grated cheese while they are still warm.When the pasta is ready, put half the pesto in the bottom of a large bowl. Drain the pasta, saving a cup of the cooking water, add the pasta to the pesto and toss, adding more pesto as you go. Add a splash of the cooking water to loosen everything, so the sauce coats the pasta. Divide the pasta between bowls, either putting a few slices of courgette on each, or passing them around so everyone can help themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b645e1eeb2ecdbca84ce70910a8b57853958062/0_291_6282_3770/master/6282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b76560efa18f18f7b8bff9dbbc3e9408","title":"seven ways to manage asthma","story":"One in 12 adults in the UK have asthma, but although it is a long-term condition, doctors now believe that, with the right precautions, most people can live active livesAsthma attacks kill three people every day in the UK, but two-thirds of these deaths are thought to be preventable. Asthma symptoms can be controlled with inhalers and oral medications, but, in case you have a severe attack, it is advisable to have a reliever inhaler on hand as it can act rapidly to relax straining airways. If you have to use a reliever inhaler three times a week or more, this is a sign that your asthma isn’t well managed and you should see your doctor to review your medication regime.Everyone with asthma has certain environmental triggers that make them susceptible to an attack. Record the things that could be making your symptoms worse and work out strategies for avoiding them. Common culprits include mould, tobacco smoke and air pollution.Various studies have found that obesity may result in more severe asthma symptoms and can even trigger the onset of the disease. The link isn’t fully understood, but scientists think it is because the condition is triggered by inflamed and swollen airways and many obese iniduals have chronic low-grade inflammation.Dusting and vacuuming rooms twice a week (while wearing a filter mask), using high-efficiency particulate air (Hepa) filters to keep the indoor air clean, and washing bedding weekly can lead to an improvement in symptoms. Using anti-dust mite covers on mattresses and pillows can reduce contact with microscopic creatures, present in dust, which can trigger an attack.Some asthmatics are very sensitive to the proteins in flakes of skin from animals, which can cause the immune system to overreact and trigger an attack. If you still want to keep a pet, grooming and bathing it frequently can help to reduce the likelihood of a reaction. Discuss using a nasal spray to control allergic symptoms with your doctor or asthma nurse.Research suggests that a regular programme of breathing exercises, such as the Papworth and Buteyko methods can improve quality of life and reduce the need to use a reliever inhaler. However, these are complementary therapies that should be used alongside medication, not as a replacement.Asthmatics can exercise. After all, Paul Scholes and Paula Radcliffe are just two examples of elite athletes who have asthma. Exercise is often good for asthmatics as it improves lung efficiency and boosts the immune system. However, if you haven’t exercised for a while, or have been experiencing regular attacks, it is best to stick to moderate aerobic exercises, such as walking, yoga or swimming (although the chlorine in swimming pools can trigger an asthma attack in some people)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9621aac8d4bdf5175e0a52fc8af89ee223b4f119/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58375c8bef7091bab6ab1f2ba3c553e1 1010w","title":"help to buy scheme new build interest rates","story":"Help-to-buy is not an option if you don’t want a new-build home – and interest rates can be higherQ In your opinion is help-to-buy a good option?

Whitehall’s lobbying tsar, Alison White, also said she will examine whether the free market think tank should be registered as a lobbyist. The two investigations were announced following an undercover investigation by Unearthed, an arm of Greenpeace, which found that in May the IEA arranged for US donors who pledged to donate £35,000 to have a private meeting with Steve Baker MP, when he was Brexit minister. Its director Mark Littlewood was also covertly filmed promising introductions to ministers for an investigator posing as a representative of a US farming investor who was considering donating to the IEA.A spokesman for Baker said that any suggestion he would attend meetings because “access” to him was being sold was entirely false and that Baker “met US Republicans in his political capacity to discuss trade relations between the two countries”.Lobbyists are expected to list their clients and any contact with ministers or senior civil servants. The IEA, which is an educational charity, does not routinely declare its donors, which are known to include tobacco, oil, alcohol and gambling companies or associations. It also emerged on Monday that the casino industry donated £8,000 to the IEA after it published a report calling for more casinos. The National Casino Forum confirmed it checked facts from the report and an internal document seen by the  suggests the forum had agreed to fund the report as a way of getting its message across through the IEA. The IEA said industry does not have “any sway or influence on the conclusions we come to in our research”. It said no one outside the think tank saw a draft of the casino report or made any changes prior to publication.The thinktank’s director, Mark Littlewood, had previously told Unearthed’s undercover investigator that a donor could fund and shape “substantial content” in research reports commissioned by the IEA, that would support calls for a free-trade deal between the UK and the US.The investigation by the Charity Commission raises questions about the IEA’s charitable status which means it enjoys tax breaks on its £2.3m annual expenditure. Charity regulations state that “an organisation will not be charitable if its purposes are political”.A Charity Commission spokeswoman said the allegations raised by the Unearthed investigation and reported in the  were “of a serious nature”. “Educational charities can play an important role in informing the public,” she said. “The law is clear, however, that they must do so in a balanced and neutral way. There are clear rules for charities regarding political activity that form a key part of both charity law and public expectations.”The commission has powers to examine the IEA’s internal financial records, legally compel it to provide information and ultimately to disqualify trustees. The IEA denies it has breached charity law.“We do not act in donors’ interests, except to the extent that they have an interest in pursuing free trade and free markets,” a spokeswoman said, adding that the thinktank makes “independent editorial decisions and then seeks funding ... It is surely uncontroversial that the IEA’s principles coincide with the interests of our donors.”Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, alleged the IEA “engaged in extensive lobbying and controversial political campaign activity in pursuit of specific policy goals, which go well beyond the scope of its objects as an ‘educational’ charity”.A former board member of the Charity Commission, Andrew Purkis, also said the regulator should be worried that the IEA’s director told undercover investigators that the thinktank was “in the Brexit influencing game”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, Littlewood denied any breach of regulations and said: “We want politicians to listen to us. I don’t apologise for that.” When asked whether the IEA was sufficiently unmindful of the interests of its donors, he said: “We have to find people with whom we have synergy. We have to raise money from companies, iniduals, foundations.”The IEA said it was “spurious to suggest that the IEA is engaging in any kind of ‘cash for access’ system”.The Institute of Economic Affairs was established in 1955 by admirers of the free-market economist Friedrich Hayek. Its mission involves “analysing and expounding the role of markets in solving economic and social problems”.\u0026nbspIn July it launched a £50,000 prize for ideas about harnessing the free market to solve the UK’s housing crisis. It is established as an educational charity and does not have to declare its donors, although it is widely known to have been backed by tobacco, alcohol and oil companies, among others. It publishes reports, and organises conferences and dinners that are often attended by government ministers as well as donors. It has a high media profile, regularly supplying spokespeople to TV news channels.Last year it spent £2.3m on its activities, which include distributing a magazine about economics to thousands of A-level students.Its trustees include Patrick Minford, a pro-Brexit economics professor who supported Margaret Thatcher, and the hedge fund billionaire and Conservative party donor Sir Michael Hintze.\u0026nbspResponding to the Greenpeace investigation, Purkis said: “Offering donor access to ministers is a practice more closely associated with commercial lobbyingPR companies or raising funds for political parties rather than charities, but charity fundraisers do quite frequently offer donors access to their patrons and celebrity supporters.“The more serious aspect for the Charity Commission may be the focus on influencing current policymaking in a particular direction, whether directly or via donors with access, which is not what educational charities should be doing. Littlewood talks about the IEA’s ‘ideological position’, which to some may suggest a closed world view that the IEA is trying to promote. Educational charities should not be promoting an ideology.”He continued: “The reference to donors being able to influence ‘substantial content’, though not conclusions, adds to the worries that the public’s trust and confidence in charities as existing solely for the public benefit can be endangered if charity reports are perceived to be ‘substantially influenced’ by big donors – who may represent particular private interests and whose identity, in the case of IEA, is often secret.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f27c91eb8a872ec461eb1034b8887d5126d4ec6/0_16_3265_1959/master/3265.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3216c8a11b2c4324c78a71026559097","title":"tory love island water bottles merchandise","story":"Latest Conservative campaign to attract young voters could infringe ITV’s trademarkTwo national institutions with substantial influence over the lives of ordinary Britons clashed on Monday, when the Conservative party attempted to cash in on the popularity of Love Island by producing knock-off merchandise inspired by the show.Theresa May’s party announced on Monday afternoon it had produced special “Love Island water bottles” in the style of those used by contestants on the dating reality TV show, offering them as a competition prize. Unlike the merchandise used by stars of the ITV2 series, which feature contestants’ names, the Tory versions carry slogans such as: “Don’t let Corbyn mug you off”.“Yeah that’s right – we’re giving away Love Island water bottles for the final (obviously),” the party said on its website, announcing the competition before the programme’s highly anticipated Monday night finale. “Some with a political twist, some not so much. Either way you’re going to be staying hydrated. With just a limited number available, winners will be chosen at random. So don’t miss your chance to get yours,” it said.Following media inquiries about potential trademark infringement the Conservatives removed all references to Love Island from the competition. The contest appeared designed to collect the contact details of young people for future campaign purposes.An ITV spokesperson did not say whether the Tory party had been asked to stop associating itself with the show, but made clear that “official Love Island water bottles are only available via the Love Island app and shop”.The Conservatives have struggled to attract younger voters in recent years and have been attempting to revamp the party’s online campaign efforts. Responding to the merchandise, the Labour-supporting campaign group Momentum said: “Dear Tories, no matter how hard you graft, young people won’t want to couple up with you. All the best, Younger voters.”Love Island merchandise and brands associated with it have proved to be highly lucrative for producers of the show, which has attracted millions of loyal younger viewers who tend to ignore traditional TV channels.

However, the law is vague, and councils have been able to reduce youth services amid wider cuts due to austerity.Earlier research, carried out by the Unison union, said that from 2012 to 2016 more than 600 youth centres closed across the UK, a loss of 140,000 places for young people.Labour said that with knife offences rising, access to good quality youth centres and other activities would form “part of a public health approach to tackling violent crime and to help young people fulfil their potential”.Cat Smith, the shadow Cabinet Office minister for youth affairs, said cuts had “left youth services across the country devastated”.She said: “With youth services targeted for budget cuts, the Tories have created the conditions in which crime can thrive, leaving young people vulnerable to violence and denied the opportunity to build a positive future.”Khan said: “As violent crime continues to rise across the country, it’s more vital than ever that we get tough on the causes of crime, as well as crime. Labour in power will deliver a properly funded youth service that will not only help young people turn away from criminal activity, but will give them the chance to fulfil their potential.”The idea of treating knife crime and other serious violent offences, especially among young people, as something meriting early intervention rather than just a policing response, is becoming increasingly common.Such an approach had been particularly effective in Scotland, where the “proactive policies” with young people and gangs have helped, coupled with laws to make jail terms the norm for carrying a knife, to significantly reduce knife offences.On Monday, the government said it was doubling funding for an early intervention scheme tackling violence among young people, from £11m to £22m over two years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495ecc52932e0a53dd6cb513f9a973934b965504/0_170_4316_2589/master/4316.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f01eb6b2e092c6e9d378b76a2a059273","title":"england india test cricket","story":"Swaths of empty seats could prove a troubling backdrop during the opening exchanges of England’s first Test against India, with Edgbaston reporting low ticket sales for what is meant to be the highlight of the cricketing summer.Warwickshire fear there could be up to 10,000 tickets unsold on both days one and two of England’s 1,000th men’s Test. Officials at the club have put what could be a disappointing turnout down to a Wednesday start that means the ground will not likely be filled up until Friday and Saturday.While ticket sales for the Ashes series next summer will doubtless be strong, figures for this week at the 25,000-capacity Edgbaston demonstrate the challenge of marketing midweek Test cricket outside London a Saturday start for the third Test in Nottingham could also throw up a similar concern later in that match.India, meanwhile, have shrugged off suggestions that they are going into the series undercooked. Ajinkya Rahane, their vice-captain, claims the true challenge over five Tests will be their mindset given the two sides should be evenly matched.The tourists cut short their one-off warm-up in Chelmsford by one day – much to the chagrin of Essex, who had to refund 2,000 tickets – in order to travel to Birmingham and begin preparations, only for rain on Sunday to delay their practice by 24 hours.Despite the opener Shikhar Dhawan registering a pair in that tour match, and the No 3 Cheteshwar Pujara averaging a meagre 14 across 12 innings in the County Championship during a spell with Yorkshire this summer, Rahane was bullish about their build-up.India are also without the injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah for the start of the series – two of the seamers behind Virat Kolhi’s side claiming 60 wickets across three Tests in South Africa this year – but Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma are expected to demonstrate the depth of Kohli’s pace attack.Rahane said: “We have an attack that can disrupt opponents.

It is the latest in a series of statement footbridges around the world. Cau Vang (meaning gold bridge) opened in June, is 150 metres long and 1,400 metres above sea level, with views across the green mountainscape. It took just under a year to construct, with initial designs by TA Landscape Architecture.The Ba Na hills mountain retreat was a favourite holiday location for the ruling French authorities in the early 20th century but fell into ruin after the revolution against colonial rule in 1945. The area is now home to a replica French village and gardens, along with a 5.8km cable car track – once the world’s longest and highest – as well as a cavernous concrete amusement complex, hidden beneath the kitsch-looking village. Remnants of the original villas have been spotted by travellers riding the cable car.Cau Vang follows in a line of unusual footbridges, seen everywhere from Iowa to India: structures that are noteworthy as architectural statements in themselves, rather than accessories for an already popular location.In 2014, the Fan Bridge was unveiled in Paddington Basin in London. It currently only operates Wednesdays and Fridays at noon and Saturdays at 2pm, leaving it somewhere between the practical and the artistic. The hydraulic structure, designed by Knight Architects, positions its five steel beams 20 metres across the water, rising in a similar way to a traditional Japanese fan.The nearby Rolling Bridge (operating Wednesdays and Fridays at noon and 4pm) unfolds its octagonal structure on one side of the canal towpath to form a walkway 12 metres across the water. It was created by Heatherwick Studio and installed in 2004 as a “sculptural object”.At the opposite end of the technology scale are the sustainable footbridges made by the Khasi people from living, natural resources in the gorges of Meghalaya, north-west India. The living root bridges are deep in the tropical forest, close to village of Mawsynram, the wettest place on earth. The most famous, the Umshiang Double Decker Living Root Bridge, took 15 years to craft into its current form. The practice itself is thought to be 180 years old, with the bridges built from rubber tree roots nurtured for years to hold human weight. This material is a preferable alternative to wood here, which decays during the monsoon season.Parting the sea might sound like an impossible act but how about building a permanent pathway through water? The Moses Bridge in the village of Halsteren, in North Brabant, Netherlands, acts like a dam under the waterline, holding the moat on either side. The “sunken” bridge, crafted from pre-treated, rot-resistant wood, was designed by Ro \u0026amp Ad Architects to provide access to a 17th-century Dutch fort.Decades of lovers have transformed a once relatively unremarkable-looking bridge in Serbia, now known as Most Ljubavi – one of the earliest versions of a love bridge. Legend has it that Nada, a teacher, would meet her army officer lover Relja on the bridge to pledge their love – but he left her during the first world war and she subsequently died of a broken heart. It is thought to have become famous thanks to a poem, Prayer for Love, written by Desanka Maksimović in the 1990s. Couples now visit the “Bridge of Love” to attach inscribed padlocks to it. The practice for good luck in love now takes place on bridges around the world.The modern, tubular Webb Bridge connects in Melbourne’s South Wharf with the Docklands area, and was designed by sculptor Robert Owen and engineered in 2003 by Arup – the company behind the Sydney Opera House. Also by Arup, the Helix Bridge in Singapore is a spiralling 300-metre DNA-inspired design from Cox architects, which completed the Marina Bay walkway in 2010.Best visited after dark to see its glowworm appearance, Henderson Waves, undulates through Singapore, connecting Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park. The 274-metre snake-like structure is made up of Balau wood and curved steel “ribs” which form shelters in its upward curves.Another delight for dusk, is the High Trestle Trail Bridge in Iowa, which runs half a mile over the Des Moines River Valley. As part of a “rails to trails” project, it helps connect the 25-mile trail from Woodward to Ankeny. The illuminated steel beams represent a view through a mine shaft, reflecting the coal mining history of the local area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c549b3ba446283c23b7dca951b28ff4879b687e9/37_0_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b56d41d6230044a37cf1f48923fec5d","title":"whoever heard of a black artist britains hidden art history","story":"Here’s an astonishing fact. Buried in cold storage at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery in Bradford is a collection of art you have never seen, by a bunch of major British artists you’ve never heard of. This small gallery contains a hundred more works by British artists of African and Asian descent than the Tate’s national collection. Without it, the story of British art is a whitewash.“If these works are not captured in public collections there’s going to be a serious distortion of history,” is how Cartwright Hall’s senior curator, Nima Poovaya-Smith, puts it in Whoever Heard of a Black Artist? Britain’s Hidden Art History (BBC Four), and it is worth noting that it took a curator of colour to make it happen. This fascinating, moving film (it made me cry, which is not something that can often be said of BBC Four art documentaries) is a powerful reminder of how easily history can be erased. It sets out to fix the distortion, the result of what artist Sonia Boyce describes as “a mass systemic amnesia” in the art establishment. Racism, to be clear.Presenter Brenda Emmanus follows Boyce as she prepares to launch an exhibition of black and Asian modernist art at Manchester Art Gallery. The film opens with archive footage of a group of artists in the 1980s discussing the denial of their very existence. “I was told by my lecturers that there was no such thing as black art” “Black people don’t make pictures” “Whoever heard of a black artist?”. All of which reminded me of what I was told, both explicitly and implicitly, growing up in those years when being arty and brown-skinned at the same time was unthinkable and then, on the rare occasions when it did happen, unmentionable. The short answer to the question of whoever heard of a black artist is “no one”. Not even those of us who might have wanted to be one.Yet, when Boyce spent three years scouring public archives she found more than 2,000 works in 30 collections. The first wave came from the Windrush generation, arriving “with a huge sense of optimism”. We don’t need history to remind us how that worked out: we are seeing how they are being treated now. Emmanus meets Althea McNish, the first successful black female artist in Britain. A grand dame who lives in Tottenham, north London, she is as fabulous as her mid-century textiles, which were snapped up by Liberty, Balenciaga and Dior. She recalls visiting wheat fields for her signature piece, Golden Harvest (1959), inspired by the sugar cane fields of her native Trinidad. “The whole place excited me,” she says.Or what about Frank Bowling, initially shown alongside David Hockney as a British pop artist before being deemed a bit too, well, Caribbean. Or Rasheed Araeen, a conceptual artist who is only now, in his 80s, getting his first comprehensive retrospective at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead. Heard of him? Me neither. Or Anwar Jalal Shemza, whose work obsessively examined the point where the square meets the circle, and who ended up as an A-level art teacher in Stafford. On Art UK, the public collections database, while Lucian Freud is richly described as British, English and German, Shemza is listed as Pakistani.Boyce and Emmanus travel to a rural Cumbrian farmhouse where Li Yuan-chia, now recognised as the father of Chinese abstraction, lived and worked in the 70s. With zero support or recognition, he created an avant-garde museum in the middle of nowhere. The LYC Museum, which showed artists including Barbara Hepworth, is now a ruin, all cracked windows and warped LYC signage lying in the rubble. There is a point at which neglect goes beyond making you angry it makes you sad. “It’s stunning … but really remote,” says Boyce, beginning to cry.By the 90s, the overtly political work of the Black Arts Movement was out and artists such as Chris Ofili, Anish Kapoor and Steve McQueen were in: mainstream, commercial and not necessarily, or solely, framing themselves as black or Asian. This opened up a space for artists of colour, but it was also a time when it became unfashionable to mention race at all when success meant assimilation, and being congratulated for not seeming black or Asian was an actual thing. A painful and insidious thing.Last year, Lubaina Himid, who came up through the Black Arts Movement, became the first black woman to win the Turner prize. “It’s difficult for me to say the white art world is racist,” she says in footage from 1986. “I can’t look at it like that. I have to look at it as something that can be changed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5d4d90a8b098aadb2a7e199fda45c182667333f/0_67_3552_2131/master/3552.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60a62b025fdf551aee34b4d8df3f6313","title":"love island 2018 the final follow all the action live","story":"Favourites Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer triumph over second place couple Paul Knops and Laura Anderson to be crowned king and queen of the villa Weirdly, my most indelible memory is the lacy trousers Rosie wore when when leaving the villa.

But recent satellite images and photos taken from helicopters show the population has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science.Why the colony on Île aux Cochons has been so decimated remains a mystery.“It is completely unexpected, and particularly significant since this colony represented nearly one third of the king penguins in the world,” said lead author Henri Weimerskirch, an ecologist at the Centre for Biological Studies in Chize, France, who first set eyes on the colony in 1982.Climate change may play a role. In 1997, a particularly strong El Niño weather event warmed the southern Indian Ocean, temporarily pushing the fish and squid on which king penguins depend south, beyond their foraging range.“This resulted in population decline and poor breeding success for all the king penguin colonies in the region,” Weimerskirch said.El Niño events are cyclical events that occur every two to seven years, but they can be amplified by global warming, which itself produces many of the same results, albeit on a longer timescale. Indeed, Weimerskirch and colleagues showed in an earlier study that climate change, on its current trajectory, will probably make the Crozet islands – the archipelago that contains Île aux Cochons – unviable for king penguins by mid-century.Migration is not an option because there are no other suitable islands within striking range.Other factors may be contributing to the decline of the Île aux Cochons colony, including overcrowding. “The larger the population, the fiercer the competition between iniduals,” noted a statement from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, which funded the study. “The repercussions of lack of food are thus amplified and can trigger an unprecedented rapid and drastic drop in numbers.”But this so-called “density-dependent effect” can also be made worse by climate change, the study notes.Another possible culprit is avian cholera, which has affected seabirds on nearby Marion and Amsterdam Islands, including some king penguins. But until Weimerskirch and other researchers return to Île aux Cochons – hopefully, he said, in early 2019 – they won’t know for sure.It is also possible that invasive species such as rats, mice or cats, have found their way on to the island. The Red List of Threatened Species conservation status for king penguins is currently “least concern,” but the new data may prompt a reevaluation.King penguins are the second-largest penguin species after the Emperor. They do not make a nest, but rather lay one egg at a time and carry it around on their feet covered with a flap of abdominal skin, called a brood patch. Parents take turns incubating the egg, switching every couple of weeks over a two-month period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb69a66f0fb4d15dba02aa617e98c915b855ce10/0_0_3071_1843/master/3071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e98b0bc86f5e91c69d6438b4538c3b","title":"zimbabwe votes first post mugabe election pictures","story":" Voters are casting their ballots in the country’s first election since the authoritarian leader was ousted last year.

File photograph: The While other airlines are making headlines for all the wrong reasons of late our readers have been more concerned with the goings on at Aer Lingus. A reader by the name of Donnchadh had two separate negative experiences with Aer Lingus which prompted him to ask us for help. First off a flight he was supposed to take from London to Dublin was cancelled on March 18th and – he says – passengers were left to fend for themselves after the cancellation was confirmed with the service desk in the airport closing swiftly once they saw the crowd of disgruntled passengers approach He said it was snowing on the day but the pilot was explicit in telling his would-be passengers that the cancellation was due to Aer Lingus “getting the runaround from various third parties in their supply chain, like the de-icing firm. And then they reached the end of their legal flying time so couldn’t fly us,” says our reader. So Donnchadh stayed overnight with a friend in London – saving Aer Lingus money in the process. But when he contacted the airline looking for compensation for his lost day, the claim was completely ignored.Fast forward to May and our reader went to London Heathrow on a Friday with the aim of returning to Dublin on the 1.30pm flight the following day to make the most of the good weather that had been forecast. The Saturday flight taxied but didn’t take off “due to some technical issue”.He says the plane and all its passengers sat on the runway until 4pm when “they announced it was cancelled.” He says that by that point he, along with many others, had been waiting with their fingers poised over the Aer Lingus app “sensing what was happening”.He was quick out of the app trap and booked himself a seat on the next available flight “to ensure I’d actually get home. I got on a 7.10pm flight – home at 9.30pm – day wasted. I’m now on the phone seeking my refund and compensation and was refunded the original flight rather than the more expensive one I had to buy – difference about €60. This is because I didn’t follow some procedure or others of theirs.”He says the reason he chose to look after himself and book on the app as opposed to with the airline in the airport is “because I wanted to get home and not have to queue and be given whatever I’d be given by what I assumed would be an understaffed helpdesk with over 100 angry people clamouring at it and because on my most recent experience with them when people went up to the desk in Gatwick to get their new flights and refunds etc, the Menzies customer service girl took one look at the crowd, shut up shop and fled. So everyone had to look after themselves anyway!” He says the “nice guy on customer service” apologised profusely, saying he “fully understands where I’m coming from, but telling me I won’t get a difference in the refund (for something not my fault) and his supervisor won’t speak to me”.Donnchadh also believes he is entitled to compensation. “They have given me a case number and sent it off to Guest Relations. Guest Relations has no phone number, no email address, no names of people and cannot be contacted. They give no timeframe re when they will get back. As far as I can see they do not like relating to guests.”He says that as when he went “through that process re March 18th (and had to submit a form by post!) I expressed my deep scepticism about anything happening re my compensation and unsurprisingly I have heard nothing from them in relation to that claim – not even an acknowledgement.”Next up was Aoife. “An Aer Lingus flight I was booked on from Lanzarote to Dublin in March was cancelled after we boarded due to a technical fault with the plane,” she writes. “We disembarked and eventually were told we would spend the night in Lanzarote and be on a flight the following evening. I’m a chef on an hourly rate and lost a day’s work and pay as a result of the cancellation.” She was glad to discover EU Regulation 2612004 which provides compensation for passengers subject to delays and cancellations and she contacted the airline to ask if there was a form or procedure to follow. She points out that Ryanair, for example, has a dedicated form on its website. “I heard nothing back within the 30 days during which the customer service department says it will respond.” She says she followed up with “five courteous queries but have heard nothing back. I understand that the next course of action is to contact the aviation authority in the country of departure and tried to find relevant contact page on the Spanish ministry for transport but it was a dead end of Spanish-only websites and missing web links.” She asks if there is another way to pursue this “or am I wasting my time? It seems that Aer Lingus simply have a policy of ignoring any correspondence related to this regulation.”So we got in touch with the airline and a spokeswoman sent us the following statements. In connection with the second story, she said the Guest Relations team had now made contact with our reader “to arrange the necessary compensation for her cancelled flight”. She said storm Emma disrupted over 28,000 passengers at the start of March and thus created a backlog of guest queries. In response, Aer Lingus has hired and trained extra staff to deal with these queries and we have made considerable improvements to our online forum. We apologise for the delayed response and for the inconvenience caused.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3581269.1532980867!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"negligence a factor in vast vast majority of 221 cervicalcheck cases says solicitor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan is seeking a meeting with Leo Varadkar this week. “I want the Taoiseach to step up and do something to protect these women. It is inhumane to watch.” Photograph: CourtPixThe “vast, vast majority” of the 221 women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy had their screenings misread through negligence, a solicitor for some of the women has said.Cian O’Carroll represents Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhathúna and Ruth Morrissey – all of whom have taken cases against the HSE and the laboratories used by the screening programme.The solicitor was responding to comments from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that litigation might be required in some cases as not all false negatives were a result of negligence.Mr O’Carroll said the Taoiseach was being “irresponsible” and trying to “muddy the issue” by making this point. “Of course not all false positives are negligence. I myself have made that point. In fact the vast majority of false negatives are not negligent,” he told The .However he said the 221 women identified by CervicalCheck were specifically selected because “their tests were misread to a significant degree and it had resulted in a delay to their diagnosis and treatment”.He said he could not say negligence was a factor in all the cases but the indications are the vast majority fall into this category. Mr O’Carroll said experts recruited to analyse the 221 cases have so far processed about 40 of them. “They feel that all of those so far involve a breach of duty of care,” he said. “So the indications are that the vast majority will be a breach of duty.” Mr O’Carroll said it was not the women who are forcing these matters to court but the HSE and the labs who are acting together. Promises by the State to settle with the women and then go after the labs for compensation have not been fulfilled, he said.“I believe the Taoiseach and the Department of Health have it within their remit to make that happen,” solicitor Caoimhe Haughey, who is representing some of the affected families, told RTÉ’s Six One News. “Spare these victims going to court.”Meanwhile, Ms Phelan said she was seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Varadkar this week. “I want the Taoiseach to step up and do something to protect these women. It is inhumane to watch.”Ms Phelan said settling the cases would be more expedient for the State, rather than paying huge legal fees."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s first trans pride parade takes place in dublin","story":"  July 28, 2018Participants call for improved healthcare and criticise Dublin Pride as \u0026lsquomarketing tool\u0026rsquo "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Legal \u0026lsquoaggression\u0026rsquo by laboratories in recent weeks has caused surpriseGarda letter to families had suggested no inquest because trial had heard evidenceGovernment stands accused of breaking promise that no woman would have to face courtRemains were dismembered by chisel, with face, hands, teeth and organs still missingLuke Wilson from Ballyfermot admits plotting with others to kill Gary Hanley last yearFiachra \u0026Oacute Ceallaigh became the first Franciscan to serve as a bishop in Ireland for over 170 yearsGarda\u0026iacute have asked for help to locate 25-year-old Simon QuinnCalls for Red and Green Lines link between Red Cow in west Dublin and CarrickminesTricolour nailed to structure and wreaths scattered at memorial to infamous atrocityAdministration of Leader programme cost \u0026euro4.4m for first half of 2018, while just \u0026euro2.7m was paid outUK researchers say parents with depression more anxious about their children\u0026rsquos healthcareNo-deal Brexit would see \u0026ldquorestrictions importing medicines from UK, Varadkar saysChild in swimming pool at villa on Marbella\u0026rsquos Golden Mile when the fatality occurredDamages of up to \u0026euro360,000 claimed by six people in collisionCian O\u0026rsquoCarroll accuses Taoiseach of being \u0026lsquoirresponsible and of \u0026lsquomudding the issue\u0026rsquoBelmont Mill in Co Offaly offers a lot to craft workers and artists \u0026ndash but no real internetAnnouncement of preferred bidder on track for September, Varadkar saysCompany owned by Independent Kerry TD wants to raise level of field near KilgarvanProperty Services Regulatory Authority dealt with 403 complaints of property agents operating without a licenceTCD researchers carry out comprehensive review into worldwide increase in procedure"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3581144.1532972120!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"now not the time for border poll on unity says mcdonald","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar restated his view that it is the wrong time for a Border poll. A poll on Irish unity should not be held while uncertainty around Brexit remains, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said.The Sinn Féin leader said she disagreed with those who argued that a hard or chaotic Brexit should be the trigger for a referendum on unification.“The obvious thing would be to say, ‘well, have the Border poll and remove the Border. If the Border is the problem, simply take it away’. And there is a certain logic to that,” she said.“I am very, very conscious that you can’t come at this issue in that simplistic way. It’s very important when we come to addressing the issue of partition we do it in the best possible climate and we do it in a way that maximises consent.“It is not my preferred option or our preferred option that we deal with the issue of Irish unity in a climate that is unsteady or unstable or chaotic, in other words in the context of a crash Brexit or a very hard Brexit.”Ms McDonald said the Border poll question should be put to one side until the “dangers” posed by Brexit are mitigated.“I would prefer . . . that we have sequencing that firstly delivers a level of economic and social certainty, in as much we can be certain, and stability and from that base we then continue the conversation about Irish unity,” she said.Ms McDonald also said unionists who failed to countenance the possibility of a united Ireland in the future were burying their heads in the sand.She was reacting to the fallout from remarks by former Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson. He said unionists should prepare for what would happen if they were to lose a future Border poll.Mr Robinson’s party colleague, Sammy Wilson, was among several prominent unionists to criticise the former first minister’s comments. Mr Wilson accused him of giving encouragement to the republican narrative.Ms McDonald said it was “common sense” to look at possible constitutional changes, even if you did not support them.“Peter Robinson certainly is not raising a banner for Irish republicanism or for a united Ireland. But I think it’s good to hear a senior unionist talk in terms that are simply grounded in realism.”Reflecting on what accommodations might be made for unionists if a united Ireland was to come to pass, the Sinn Féin president also indicated she would be prepared to accept a different flag and national anthem. “I, as with every other person who argues for a new united Ireland, will honour the flag of that island, will honour the dawning of that new opportunity and I would be proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with my fellow citizens, irrespective of religious creed, political background cultural background, irrespective of everything that has gone before. And I would proudly sing the anthem or anthems of that Ireland.”Ms McDonald has urged the Orange Order to think again after it snubbed her offer of a meeting. “At this stage, in the year 2018, the notion that you are not going to talk to your neighbour, the notion that you are not going to talk to somebody in political leadership, that you are not going to tease out contentious issues, is simply not a runner.”Earlier on Monday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar restated his view that it is the wrong time for a Border poll.“I think it’s not helpful to be talking about a Border poll in Northern Ireland,” he said. “We are in a situation whereby there is huge uncertainty in Northern Ireland because people don’t know what’s going to happen in terms of Brexit, but also the Northern Ireland parties haven’t been able to come together and form an executive. For me to start talking about a Border poll in that context wouldn’t be helpful.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3580695.1532959344!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk foreign secretary discusses potential free trade deal with china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChinese foreign minister Wang Yi, right, with UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt at a press briefing at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on Monday, July 30th, 2018. Photograph: Andy WongAPChina has offered to hold talks with Britain on a post-Brexit free trade deal during a visit by foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is in Beijing to try to rekindle the “Golden Era” of Sino-British co-operation.Mr Hunt, who succeeded Boris Johnson this month as foreign secretary, accidentally touched on tensions between Beijing and Tokyo over regional influence when he said his Chinese wife Lily Guo was Japanese.“My wife is Japanese – my wife is Chinese. That’s a terrible mistake to make,” he told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Mr Hunt speaks Japanese and lived there as an English teacher.The gaffe was laughed off as matters turned to the far trickier issue of trade, which will dominate Mr Hunt’s trip, his first as foreign secretary, as China is seeking allies in its trade war with the US.The conflict was started by the Trump government, which accuses China of stealing American intellectual property and discriminating against foreign firms. He wants China to address a $375 billion (€321 billion) trade surplus and has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports.Mr Hunt said Mr Wang had offered to open discussion on a possible free-trade deal between Britain and China, post-Brexit.“That’s something that we welcome and we said that we will explore,” Mr Hunt told a joint news conference, without elaborating.Britain is eager to secure a strong trade pact to help it offset the potential effects on the economy after it leaves the European Union.Prime minister Theresa May failed to secure a formal agreement for a trade deal during her visit to China this year. Trade links between Britain and China are worth about €78 billion.Chinese statements on Brexit have been supportive of Britain, but couched in broad terms without specifics.Ever-cautious Beijing is clearly waiting to see how the situation develops once the UK has formally left the European bloc. Formal talks on trade cannot begin until Britain leaves the EU next year.Mr Wang took the opportunity to criticise Washington’s trade stance but said China was open to negotiation to end the trade war.“The responsibility for the trade imbalance between China and the United States lies not with China,” he said. The global role of the US dollar, along with low American savings rates, huge levels of consumption and restrictions on high-tech exports were to blame for the imbalance.“China’s door to dialogue and negotiations is always open, but dialogue needs to be based on equality and mutual respect and on rules,” Mr Wang said. “Any unilateral threats and pressure will only have the opposite effect.”Mr Hunt will also be hoping to talk about Hong Kong’s semi-autonomy and growing concerns that Beijing is eroding the former crown colony’s civil liberties.Mr Wang said China remained committed to the “one country, two systems” governing framework in Hong Kong, introduced 21 years ago this week after the city reverted to Chinese rule, but he also took a firm line on what Beijing sees as none of Britain’s business.“Hong Kong affairs are the domestic affairs of China. We do not welcome nor do we accept other countries to interfere in China’s domestic affairs,” Mr Wang said.“But of course China will continue to support and will stay committed to one country, two systems,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576025.1532515721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sean spicer i became the story too often","story":"As US president Donald Trump celebrates 100 days in office, White House press secretary Sean Spicer marks his own 100 days of public prominence since he briefed the media on Trump\u0027s inauguration. Video: David Dunne\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSean Spicer in the Trump Hotel in  Washington:  set to embark on a month-long tour to promote his new book. Photograph: Mitchell LongIt has just turned noon on a weekday in Washington, and at the Trump International Hotel a black SUV glides into the side entrance. A ripple of anticipation passes through the small crowd as onlookers strain to see who is hiding behind the darkened windows, when out pops Sean Spicer.The boyish former White House press secretary is all smiles as he bounds up the steps to the hotel. Inside he is greeted like a prodigal son, shaking hands with the staff members and beaming as he walks through the lobby.We’re here to meet for lunch – at my suggestion. The Trump Hotel has become something of a mecca for Republican strategists and Trump officials since the election of the 45th president of the United States, bumping some of the city’s more established boltholes like the Willard Hotel down the list when it comes to go-to meeting spots and sparking outrage from ethics watchdogs.I ask him if he comes here often. “Not so much when I was in the administration – it was tricky – but much more now,” he says, as we make our way to the hotel restaurant, which overlooks a stunning atrium.Donald Trump has visited the restaurant several times since becoming president 18 months ago – one of the few times he has been spotted outside the White House or at official events since moving to Washington from Manhattan.We take our seats at a quiet table just next to the booth where the President, along with his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, had dinner with Nigel Farage a month after the election.Spicer takes a quick phonecall. It’s someone from the White House. They are trying to co-ordinate with Spicer’s assistant who is delivering copies of his book. “Just make sure Potus gets a copy before he gets on the plane,” he says, using the DC shorthand for the President of the United States. “And Flotus, I want her to have one too” he adds, referring to the First Lady. “Sorry about that,” as he turns to the task at hand.As we settle down with menus, Spicer recommends the bacon for starters – an elaborate process that involves the waiter searing raw bacon at the table. After that, it’s a healthy salad and still water for the former press secretary who is in full-on health mode as he embarks on a frenetic month-long tour to promote his new book.He’s just off the express train from New York, where he was taking part in TV interviews for the various network chatshows. Further readings and events around the eastern seaboard await.\u0026nbspSpicer may be hailed as a superstar in the Trump Hotel but elsewhere he remains a controversial figure. He was heckled at a book event in New York and has been lambasted by interviewers for his role in promulgating the notion of fake news.“It’s been a busy few months,” says Spicer, who explains the rationale behind writing the book. “It was a few months after I left the White House. I was giving speeches, interviews that I realised that in most cases people would say ‘I read a story that said you said this,’ or ‘I heard that you said that.’ I finally realised that I could either leave it up to all of these anonymous sources to talk about me, or I could tell my own story in my own words.”The result is The Briefing, a 250-page book released this week that recounts Spicer’s six months in the White House. Though the last year or so has witnessed a flurry of books on the Trump presidency – most notably Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury and James Comey’s A Higher Loyalty – this is the only memoir from someone who served in the Trump administration.Despite the huge churn of staff at the White House there have been no kiss-and-tells. Senior officials such as Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn and Hope Hicks have largely kept their counsel since serving and leaving the Trump administration.But Sean Spicer’s new book is unlikely to cause the President or his team too much concern – it is unfailingly positive about Donald Trump.One line from the book, which has been widely mocked, is his description of the President as “a unicorn, riding like a unicorn over a rainbow”. At other points Spicer is less fawning and more analytical about the President’s talents.“What made the Trump campaign so different was that eight times out of 10 they would break the rules and be proven right. We’d said you can’t do that, and they would do it anyways. And it would work,” he writes. It’s difficult to argue with.But the huge problems presented by Trump’s presidency – from his aggressive, anti-immigration stance to his incendiary language and attacks against the media – loom across the pages of the book, a constant elephant in the room.When we meet, it is just days after Trump’s widely-panned summit with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. What is his view on the President’s handling of the situation?Spicer pauses. “I’m glad they made it clear what his position was, in his statements in the days after, and his interviews.“Having been on the inside, I know that it’s easy to immediately cast judgment on things, without knowing some of the back and forth that happened behind the scenes. At the end of the day, the question is did you fix or make it clear what you were intending – I think it was made clear.”I ask if it is a turning-point for his supporters. “No. Like so many things that affect Trump, he has faced countless obstacles, but has come back. His critics have said this a hundred times before.” He points out that Newt Gingrich – a Trump ally who described the Russian meeting as the worst mistake of Trump’s presidency – is now “back on track” after the President’s claim that he does in fact believe US intelligence that Russia interfered in the election.Similarly, I ask him how he can stand over a president who has become the face of an immigration policy that separates children from their parents. Again, a short pause, before he effectively side steps the issue.“I think that part of being a Republican is standing for strong borders and strong national security. I think we need to do a better job of messaging that,” he says. “Are we doing immigration the right way, are we ensuring that people are coming in at the proper point of entry, are we ensuring that children are travelling with people who are their legal s or parents? There is a way that we can do this better, there’s no question about it,” he says, always the consummate PR professional.But if Spicer is consistently\u0026nbsployal to his former boss, he is more honest about himself and his own shortcomings as press secretary. “I became the story too often,” he says candidly, as he reflects on his time in the White House. Was he to blame for this, or was it an inevitable outcome of representing the most unconventional president in recent history when the daily White House press briefings became must-see viewing? “Some of it was timing, but some of it was me. There are a lot of things I would have loved to do over again.”Spicer’s infamous claim about the crowd sizes at Trump’s inauguration are explored in the book, as are his tense first press briefing when he stormed out of the room without taking questions.“Yes, sometimes. Anyone who doesn’t acknowledge some degree of personal pain is lying. There were plenty of times I would have liked to do something again, but it’s not just how it works.”Spicer is full of praise for his successor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “The job is to represent the President. She does that, and has successfully managed not to be the story.”Nonetheless, Spicer shares many of his former boss’s views on the media. In his book he criticises the White House press corps “pack mentality”.“The inability of any journalist in the briefing room to call out the bad or misleading reporting or antics of another reporter for fear of retribution is a problem,” he writes. He also says the media is “obsessed with palace intrigue instead of issues of substance, prioritising the number of clicks, viewers, and subscriptions”.But what about the President’s relentless attacks on the free press?He backtracks slightly: “Look, I think we shouldn’t paint anything with a broad brush – be it the media, Republicans, conservatives, what have you. It’s a much more effective strategy to highlight particular instances of concern. You don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are good reporters, good stories – but what we want to do is to make sure that we call out bad stories, bad narratives.”On one issue though he is consistent – he still contends (as he has said before) that there has been too much focus by the media on the Russia investigation. This is difficult territory for the former press secretary. Like many current and former Trump officials, Spicer is widely believed to have been interviewed by the Robert Mueller team as part of the Russia investigation. He declines to discuss it.But on the wider issue of the Russian investigation he wants to set the record straight.“Do I think we should be doing every single thing we can to be ensuring integrity in our voting systems? Yes. Do I think we should be doing every single thing to stop Russia or any other entity from meddling in our voting? Yes. Should we condemn it? Yes. Let’s be 100 per cent crystal clear on that, and the more the White House can clarify that the better. The other issue with which I think the President is rightly frustrated is this focus on – two years later – a narrative about collusion with Russia.”Spicer’s lengthy description of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his central role in the Trump campaign in the book has also raised eyebrows. Manafort, who worked on Trump’s campaign for five months, is currently in jail awaiting trial. On this point, Spicer is unapologetic. He points out that Manafort is in jail for failure to register as a foreign agent for clients he\u0026nbsphad years ago – “nothing that happened in the campaign”. He says that Manafort was brought into the campaign to focus on delegates at the convention. “Manafort had worked for Ford, Dole, Reagan. He’s been involved in delegate counting and conventions going back to the 1970s. There is no question that for that task at that time he was the right man.”Some of the most interesting passages of The Briefing are those which deal with his time at the Republican National Committee (RNC). (Though it also reveals that in his younger years, he worked for democratic Senator George Mitchell, who would later become Northern Ireland envoy.) Spicer worked for the Republican party organisation for six years, both as communications director, and chief strategist, working closely with Reince Priebus, who was tapped by Trump to become chief of staff, before being replaced by John Kelly.He was at the heart of the organisation when Donald Trump emerged as an unlikely contender for the presidential nomination, and eventually as the Republican candidate, a relationship he charts in the book.Eighteen months after the election, how does Spicer assess relations between establishment Republicans and Donald Trump now? Trump has publicly sparred with congressional leaders like Mitch McConnell, while respected Republicans such as John McCain and Lindsey Graham have openly criticised the President. But in recent months, most Republicans in Congress have rowed in behind him. Has Trumpism become the new Republicanism?“To an extent, I think that the sitting president always defines the party. In the same way, there were conversations about the direction of the Democratic Party in 1992 under Bill Clinton, there was discussion of whether Obama was bringing the party further to the left, I think the president will always reflect the party which has the White House.”He continues: “Look, the rank and file of the Republican party support Trump. That is why the party is supporting him. They’re not just following him willy-nilly. They’re following him because of the support he has. He’s got the second-highest approval among Republicans in modern history, second after George W Bush following 911, so you can make the case that there are a lot of elites within Washington DC that are unsure, but if you look at the rank and file of the party, they’re with him.”As for his own future, he has set up a consultancy firm in DC and is a regular contributor to conservative channels such as Fox News. He lives in Alexandria Virginia, just outside Washington, with his wife Rebecca, a well-known public affairs professional in DC, and their two children.Significantly Spicer has joined America First, the political action committee established to forward the Trump-Pence agenda, prompting speculation that he could be heavily involved in Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. Trump jnr and Jason Miller attended Sean Spicer’s lavish book launch party at the Trump Hotel earlier this week. If there is any residual split in the Republican party since the election of the firebrand Donald Trump, it is clear whose side Spicer is on.He says he believes that President Trump will run again in 2020. But will he win? “Right now, if the election was held, yes,” he says, pointing to his huge support among the Republican base outside DC.I ask him if he misses the job. “No,” he says emphatically. “I miss the people, I’m glad I did, I was honoured to do it, but it was unbelievably intense. This was after six years at the RNC which was also intense.”There is one job he hasn’t ruled out though. Rumours surfaced a year ago, that he could be in the running to become the US ambassador to Ireland. Two candidates who were under consideration for the job have dropped out, with the result that Ireland is one of only a handful of European countries without a US ambassador.Spicer is a proud Irish-American, who in the past has spoken fondly of his Irish heritage and of William Spicer, his great-grandfather, who he said emigrated from Kinsale. He told The  that the Corkman won a medal of honour “for extraordinary heroism” sweeping mines for the US navy in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, during the Spanish-American War in 1898.Still, Spicer is coy when asked if he would be interested in the post of US ambassador to Ireland. “Right now, my focus is on the book tour, and my work here, but the idea of public service, serving my country is something that appeals to me. I would never rule anything out.”He visited the US ambassador’s residence in Dublin\u0027s\u0026nbspPhoenix Park during a recent trip to Ireland, and is due to visit the city\u0026nbspagain this month. Among the anecdotes in the book, he describes how he loaned\u0026nbspPresident Trump a green tie for Enda Kenny’s visit. Whether “Ambassador” Sean Spicer is next on the agenda will ultimately be the decision for the President.As we finish lunch and make our way back to the lobby, people start pointing and taking photographs. “I’m used to it,” he says with his trademark smile. “I was checking out of my hotel in New York this morning, this guy said to me . . . ‘Do you know who you remind me of?’” It happens all the time.”With that, he waves goodbye and walks\u0026nbspout the hotel door, head held high, ready for the next adventure.The Briefing by Sean Spicer, is out now (Biteback Publishers)"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Paul Manafort earned more than $60 million from Ukraine, Robert Mueller says ahead of trialWho Is America? episode 3 review: Sacha Baron Cohen\u0026#39s uninspired satire misses the targetShirley Ballas\u0026#39s Who Do You Think You Are? shone a light on ordinary people forgotten by history – reviewJohn \u0026#39Goldfinger\u0026#39 Palmer\u0026#39s widow: There\u0026#39s more chance of finding Lord Lucan than catching my husband\u0026#39s killerCorbyn ally blames Labour\u0026#39s anti-Semitism row on \u0026#39Jewish Trump fanatics making up allegations\u0026#39Zimbabwe election: Nelson Chamisa claims foul play as historic poll closesSwiss lab that analysed Salisbury nerve agent says it was targeted by Russian hackersSmart meters will let companies change cost of electricity every 30 minutes under \u0026#39surge pricing\u0026#39 Al Sharpton backs Uber in battle for New York Citys of the Galaxy cast come out in support of fired director James GunnHarley-Davidson unveils new range of electric motorbikes and an electric bicycleLabour councillor suspended over anti-Semitism after claim Mossad trying to stop Jeremy CorbynFinancial adviser stole £15m from his clients to fund gambling addictionDuterte watches luxury vehicles destroyed in Philippines smuggling crackdownDestructive California fires could be \u0026#39the new normal\u0026#39Children should be taught in school about how to make marriage work, Prince of Wales’ orceEiffel Tower staff to strike over new ticketing system that causes \u0026#39monster queues\u0026#39Isil holds 30 women and girls captive after deadly assault on southern SyriaComment: The polar bear shooting tells us everything that\u0026#39s wrong with selfie-driven wildlife tourismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The drought has struck 20 provinces, with the worst affected in the north and west.More than 50,000 have already been driven off the land to the city of Herat.Families fleeing the drought last week told the  the crisis was likely to drive more Afghans abroad to seek a better life.The drought comes on top of worsening violence in the country\u0027s long-running conflict and a struggling economy.Large numbers of livestock have died and families have little to eat, while the harvest is expected to fail totally in weeks.One farmer called Ghulam told the  he was facing catastrophe and would consider joining a militant group if it meant his son would not starve.“ I can assure you that some nights, none of these families have even bread to eat, and they go to sleep hungry.

So much of what we have been told by Essex Police has been hogwash.”Murder detectives quizzed two of Palmer\u0027s associates under caution, but have since admitted tens of thousands of people had reason to want him dead.John and Marnie Palmer in TenerifeMrs Palmer said: For the first time in his life, my husband had relaxed about all those threats against him. For years he had been so paranoid about assassination attempts. I was sleepless at times. But security had been scaled down dramatically at his homes over the last four years of life. His Rottweilers, always by his side, were all the security he needed.”In a new book, she chronicles Palmer\u0027s extraordinary rise from poverty, detailing how she saw some of the sparkling bars from Brink’s-Mat - then the hottest property in the world - arriving at her home, near Bath, to be melted down in Palmer’s homemade smelter.Marnie Palmer has criticised the police investigation into her husband\u0026#39s murderIn 1987, Palmer swaggered out of the Old Bailey after a shock not guilty jury verdict. Mrs Palmer still insist to anyone who asks that Palmer had no inkling it was loot from the so-called “crime of the century.By the 1990s, the couple were flying at will on Concorde, with private jets, helicopters and a yacht also at their disposal. The Sunday Times Rich List claimed he was worth £300m – making him richer than the Queen.However, police would eventually estimate that Palmer had duped at least 17,000 timeshare victims – mostly British pensioner. Investigators untangled a fraudulent network that stretched from dodgy Canary Islands resorts to numbered accounts in countless tax havens.John Palmer had a £300 million fortune including access to a private jetMrs Palmer says she still feels terrible for those that lost their hard-earned cash. but claimed the situation spiralled beyond even her husband\u0027s control.Palmer was convicted of fraud in 2001 and hit with one of the biggest bankruptcy orders in history.  His personal life became equally messy. He remained married to Marnie, but kept lovers in luxury for decades, and fathered children with the three of them.  When he was killed Palmer was living in Essex with his son James, and Christina Ketley, who played a key part in his shady business interests.John Palmer\u0026#39s hitman drilled a hole in his fence in order to stalk himPalmer\u0027s lone hitman was able to stalk him for hours on June 24, 2015, drilling a small hole made in the garden fence, before jumping over and firing six bullets from a .32 calibre silenced revolver.Marnie says rumours that Palmer had turned supergrass in a bid to escape another jail stint in Spain for fraud, firearm possession and money laundering were “nonsense”.But she adds: The scene of the murder was simply too convenient. John was found in the only spot where he had not installed CCTV. And where were his dogs? It was virtually unheard of for him to keep his Rottweilers inside.The police were watching his every move in the months before he died. They really should have known more about his activities, his associates and his potential enemies, yet officers are completely lost at sea.”John Palmer was acquitted of involvement in the Brink\u0026#39s Mat raidDespite his long-term affairs and violent outbursts, she says she is in little doubt that she remained his real love. He refused three attempts by Marnie to orce him. Her new book details one grim account of him putting a gun to her head and pulling the trigger. Fortunately the barrel was empty.\u0027What destroyed us was his drug-taking, womanising and violence. Our marriage veered from exciting and loving to, on any given day, deceitful, angry and terrifying.... I now know the affairs lasted from the early days of our marriage until the day he died.:: Goldfinger and Me: Bullets, Bullion and Betrayal, by Marnie Palmer and Tom Morgan, is published on August 3, with The History Press. £9.99 in paperback.

A quarter add sugar to their drink and 80 per cent take it with milk.Another of Orwell’s points remains just as salient today: “Tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country.”Please review our commenting policyPaul Manafort earned more than $60 million from Ukraine, Robert Mueller says ahead of trialWho Is America?

We immediately informed the conference invitees that the document was not ours, and pointed out the danger,” Kurt Münger of the office said. Personnel in protective suits remove an item from Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury in JulyIt was not clear if any participants had opened the document and been infected, but Mr Münger said the lab had “not registered any outflow of data”.The Moscow-based cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab found that the hackers had Russian language skills, according to the report. The Spiez lab confirmed that Sandworm, a group of hackers widely believed to be linked to Russia\u0027s GRU military intelligence agency, was suspected.The German publication Spiegel previously reported that Sandworm attacked two German public broadcasters along with the Swiss lab in June. Briton Dawn Sturgess died of exposure to Novichok near Salisbury in JulyCybersecurity experts have accused Sandworm of knocking out Ukrainian power grids in 2016.  Swiss intelligence has fingered the Russian government for previous cyberattacks on organisations in the country, including the International Olympic Committee and IT companies. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed in April that the Spiez lab had found the Western-made BZ nerve agent in the Salisbury samples, but the Swiss facility responded on Twitter that there was no doubt that the substance used was Novichok.The Department of Homeland Security said this month that the GRU military intelligence agency had infiltrated power plants across the United States.The Spiez lab focuses on chemical, biological and nuclear warfare and is part of the country\u0027s civil defence network.Please review our commenting policyPaul Manafort earned more than $60 million from Ukraine, Robert Mueller says ahead of trialWho Is America?

We really badly need change,” said a 61-year-old man who cast his ballot in the Harare suburb of Newlands. “But I don’t want to give you my name or say who I voted for because we don’t know what the repercussions will be afterwards. It would be easy to track me down.”Zanu-PF have ruled Zimbabwe for 38 years and Mr Mnangagwa\u0027s near total dominance in the media makes him the front runner in the election. He has sought to attract former opposition voters by publicly breaking with Mr Mugabe and promising a “New Dispensation” of democratic and economic reforms.Nelson Chamisa voted at the 2 Primary High School in Kuwadzana, HarareHowever, Mr Chamisa has made  significant inroads into former Zanu PF strongholds in rural areas and has attracted large crowds at his rallies.He has said he is certain of victory and that any other outcome could only be the result of vote-rigging by Zanu-PF. “I am moderately bullish,” said Terence Mukupe, the Zanu-PF candidate for the constituency of Harare East, before casting his vote. “The MDC vote is split, and the business community, the white community, and the middle classes who used to vote for the opposition have largely switched to ED,” he said, using Mr Mnangagwa’s initials.But as polls closed on Monday evening there were signs that Mr Chamisa had made inroads into Zanu-PF’s own traditional strongholds. One 71-year-old grandmother from a village 40 miles north of Harare said she did not vote for Zanu-PF for the first time because she said she now felt “safe” to support the opposition. Africa\u0026#039s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#039s economy reeling“We….my friends from church like sweet things, and so some of us grandmothers voted for Chamisa,” she laughed. The election has been dominated by the legacy of Mr Mugabe, with both candidates promising a break with the stagnation and political violence of his rule. The former dictator, 94, made a surprise intervention on the eve of the election, saying he would not vote for his own Zanu-PF party and hinting that he would back Mr Chamisa instead. He was cheered when he showed up to vote at his polling station in Highfield, a township on the southern outskirts of Harare, with his wife Grace. Mrs Mugabe was yesterday stripped of her diplomatic immunity by a court in South Africa, where she is facing allegations of assaulting model Gabriella Engels\u0027 with an electrical cord in when she discovered her in the company of her sons in a luxury Johannesburg hotel. Another observer in Harare who was in contact with groups in other parts of the country, said there had been isolated incidents of voter intimidation. “So far, and it is too early to make conclusions, there does not seem to have been any pattern or targeted bias. We have heard from colleagues in one or two rural areas - and this needs to be checked - there were some instances of intimidation, but not systemic or as ugly as in the past.”Mr Mnangagwa called the election a beautiful expression of freedom and democracy and called on candidates not to call the result before the electoral commission announces the official outcome.  In our millions, we voted in the spirit of tolerance, mutual respect \u0026amp peace, he wrote on Twitter after polling closed.Let us remember that no matter which way we voted, we are all brothers and sisters, and this land belongs to us all.Please review our commenting policyPaul Manafort earned more than $60 million from Ukraine, Robert Mueller says ahead of trialWho Is America? episode 3 review: Sacha Baron Cohen\u0026#39s uninspired satire misses the targetShirley Ballas\u0026#39s Who Do You Think You Are? shone a light on ordinary people forgotten by history – reviewJohn \u0026#39Goldfinger\u0026#39 Palmer\u0026#39s widow: There\u0026#39s more chance of finding Lord Lucan than catching my husband\u0026#39s killerCorbyn ally blames Labour\u0026#39s anti-Semitism row on \u0026#39Jewish Trump fanatics making up allegations\u0026#39Swiss lab that analysed Salisbury nerve agent says it was targeted by Russian hackersSmart meters will let companies change cost of electricity every 30 minutes under \u0026#39surge pricing\u0026#39 Al Sharpton backs Uber in battle for New York Citys of the Galaxy cast come out in support of fired director James GunnHarley-Davidson unveils new range of electric motorbikes and an electric bicycleLabour councillor suspended over anti-Semitism after claim Mossad trying to stop Jeremy CorbynFinancial adviser stole £15m from his clients to fund gambling addictionDuterte watches luxury vehicles destroyed in Philippines smuggling crackdownDestructive California fires could be \u0026#39the new normal\u0026#39Children should be taught in school about how to make marriage work, Prince of Wales’ orceEiffel Tower staff to strike over new ticketing system that causes \u0026#39monster queues\u0026#39Isil holds 30 women and girls captive after deadly assault on southern SyriaComment: The polar bear shooting tells us everything that\u0026#39s wrong with selfie-driven wildlife tourismGang of boys who threw flour at disabled woman \u0026#39put under police protection for their safety\u0026#39 We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1510  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/24/09/rtsdz5v.jpg","title":"deutsche bank brexit staff move jobs frankfurt london city euro clearing","story":"Created with Sketch.London has been regarded as a leader in the clearing market but European rivals now encroachingClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit: Deutsche Bank moves half of euro clearing business from London to FrankfurtDeutsche Bank has moved almost half of its euro clearing business from London to Frankfurt because of Brexit.

This has a huge impact on social mobility.”The\u0026nbsplatest statistics\u0026nbspfrom the Department for Education (DfE) showed\u0026nbsp28 per cent of four and five-year-olds lacked the early communication skills – such as being able to talk about events in the past or future – expected by the end of reception year.Mr Hinds will set out his plans to halve the number of children starting school without vital literacy skills by 2028.\u0026nbspAn awareness-raising campaign – similar to the “five-a-day”\u0026nbspcampaign that encouraged more people to eat fruit and vegetables – could be introduced to change busy parents’ behaviour.Mr Hinds will say: “It is a persistent scandal that we have children starting school not able to communicate in full sentences, not able to read simple words.\u0026nbspThis matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up. Your peers don’t wait, the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.”Mr Hinds will highlight that the vast majority of preschool children spend most of their time at home, adding that the government cannot afford to ignore “the home learning environment”.“I don’t have any interest in lecturing parents here, he will say.\u0026nbspI know it’s parents who bring up their children, who love them, who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children.\u0026nbspBut that doesn’t mean extra support and advice can’t be helpful.The coalition will hold a summit in the autumn to come up with practical ideas that boost parents’ confidence to\u0026nbspsupport\u0026nbsptheir child’s language and literacy from an early age.Children with poor vocabulary at age five are more than twice as likely to be unemployed aged 34 as children with good vocabulary.Mr Hinds will add there are “legitimate worries about screen time” but he hopes technology can be used to “build parents’ confidence” around early language development.Earlier this month, acclaimed author Philip Pullman said parents needed to get off their mobile phones and speak to young children to boost their vocabulary.Amanda Spielman, head of Ofsted, has also raised her concerns about the word gap. Following her speech to nursery leaders, early years experts suggested that the fact a lot of parents were spending time on their phones had contributed to poor language skills among young children.UK news in picturesForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt followed in the footsteps of his gaffe-prone predecessor Boris Johnson as he mistakenly referred to his Chinese wife as Japanese whilst on his first diplomatic mission to ChinaBritain\u0027s Geraint Thomas, left, wearing the overall leader\u0027s yellow jersey and Britain\u0027s Luke Rowe hold the flag of Wales during the 21st and last stage of the 105th edition of the Tour de France cycling race between Houilles and Paris Champs-Elysees.

making a pupil’s experience less of a lottery at the mercy of a particular teacher’s taste - critics of the curriculum argue that, in practice, repeating the same texts year after year can be a deadening business that does no one any favours.Just ask John Keats or the Metaphysical poets.With that in mind, here’s our round-up of the books most ill-used by English teachers and their classes alike.This American favourite from Harper Lee addressed themes of race and injustice still pertinent in US society today and unquestionably deserves it places in the classroom.Even students who do not pursue reading as a leisure activity after graduation remember Lee’s principled\u0026nbspAlabama attorney Atticus\u0026nbspFinch – seen through the eyes of his daughter Scout – as he comes to the aid of falsely accused black defendant Tom Robinson\u0026nbspin the courtroom.Memorably played on screen by Gregory Peck, the work is also earnest to a fault and, as propaganda for lawyers, deserves to be taken with more than just a pinch of salt.Lord of the Flies (1954)A novel with much to say about the innate barbarity of man, a subject with which its GCSE\u0026nbsplevel readership should already have firsthand experience, William Golding’s work is bleak indeed and something of a slog.But the tale of Ralph, Jack, Piggy and their classmates forming their own tribe on a desert island before\u0026nbsptearing themselves apart in a fury of self-destructive occult violence might be repurposed as a Brexit allegory, I suppose.Tennessee Williams’ operatic Southern Gothic melodrama\u0026nbspconcerns Blanche DuBois, an ageing and deeply delusional ex-belle, who arrives in New Orleans to stay with her tirelessly patient sister Stella, only to find herself at war with her brother-in-law, the brutish, resentful Stanley Kowalski.Agreeably dark and even lurid at times, Streetcar was a safe choice for students due to its brooding adult themes and copious stage directions from the author, making it readily comprehensible and a neat introduction to stagecraft.Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire\u0026nbsp(Rex )However, it was always utterly excruciating to read aloud from as a class exercise, putting already awkward adolescents under pressure to imitate Marlon Brando or Vivien Leigh and attempt a period Louisiana\u0026nbspaccent without looking ridiculous in front of their smirking contemporaries.Aaah have always depended on the kindness of strangers...JB Priestley’s play assumes the guise of an Agatha Christie-esque\u0026nbspparlour whodunit as a means through which\u0026nbspto explore Edwardian class prejudice and hypocrisy.The great public intellectual of his day, Priestley has fallen oddly out of fashion of late, kept alive primarily by this very text being handed out to Britain’s school kids on the syllabus.Fans of the twist ending may nevertheless still prefer The Usual Suspects (1995).The Return of the Native (1878)Thomas Hardy saw classical tragedy wherever he looked and this tale of the ill-fated marriage\u0026nbspbetween free-spirited Eustacia\u0026nbspVye and\u0026nbspidealistic schoolmaster Clem Yeobright\u0026nbspamid the wilds of Egdon\u0026nbspHeath is no exception.Shorter than much of Dickens, this is as fine an entry point to the Victorian novel as any other - and packed with breezy comedy\u0026nbspcompared with\u0026nbspJude the Obscure (1895).Many students are still put off by Hardy’s curious melding\u0026nbspof grandiosity with folk detail and rustic humour and by his penchant for\u0026nbspheavy symbolism and ornate literary references.Realistically, how many finish it in time for their exams without resorting to skipping long passages or even just guessing the ending?Another quintessential Victorian “monster”, Emily Bronte’s\u0026nbspGothic romance about the tortured love affair between Catherine Earnshaw and the untamable\u0026nbspHeathcliff\u0026nbspon the wild and windy moors must have been foisted on everybody at some point.Wuthering Heights from 2011An extraordinary product of its young author’s fevered imagination, especially given the secluded life she and her prolific siblings led, Wuthering\u0026nbspHeights’ themes are sufficiently ghoulish to retain the interest but it\u0027s an unattractive group of villains on show to be sure.Kate Bush may or may not be a helpful teaching aid.Conventional wisdom insists that Shakespeare must be put before young teenagers to improve their minds but surely more are alienated by the difficulties of the language at that age than are turned on to his totemic histories, tragedies, comedies and sonnets.The idea that the Bard should be held for maturity like fine whiskey and cigars never seems to cut any ice though and so the same old hump through Romeo and Juliet (1597) and\u0026nbspMacbeth (1606) to the melancholy Prince of Denmark continues unabated.Hamlet is at least a malcontent and a wit and what interestingly gloomy teen has not practiced his famous soliloquy in front of the bathroom mirror?Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/16/mosque-1.jpg","title":"seyran ates islam mosque religon germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women\u0027s rights activist, could not find a mosque where she felt at home. So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s.

Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano transferred from Corinthians, but the Brazilian club had not actually owned them. A consortium of mysterious companies held the economic rights to the players, causing complications with contracts that eventually resulted in West Ham being fined a record £5.5 million.The saga resulted in the Premier League abolishing third-party ownership of players in 2008.\u0026nbspBut that same year, a paper was published describing a revolutionary technology that held the potential to transform the way assets are owned, traded and sold. It was called the blockchain.A decade after Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper was published, thousands of applications have already been built using blockchain technology, including the first and most famous cryptocurrency: bitcoin. The decentralised online ledger Nakamoto described allows assets, such as a digital currency, to be ided into digital tokens and traded through a smart contract system that is both transparent and permanent.Famous footballers have already been jumping on the blockchain bandwagon. Earlier this year Michael Owen launched his own cryptocurrency and Lionel Messi recently endorsed a blockchain smartphone. But what if players were actually on the blockchain itself? This is the idea of some payments experts, who believe the technology could one day transform the football transfer market.“The ledger entry for a single player could be ided into multiple shares, each capable of being sold inidually to create a fractional ownership scheme,” Lu Zurawski, practice lead for retail banking at payments systems firm ACI Worldwide, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Depending on the type of ledger technology used, these shares would be tradable and could be bought and sold via exchanges – teal folding money being used in exchange for player tokens.”So while the rights for a player would remain with the club they play for, the creation of a secure, verifiable and immutable record of ownership in the form of a blockchain-based ledger would allow fans or investors to own a stake of the players. It would also facilitate greater trust and transparency for players, agents, clubs and authorities.“Given the murky reputation of football dealings at all levels of the game, such a system might be a great way of cleaning up tax evasion, money laundering and, potentially, modern day slavery,” Mr Zurawski explained, adding that the Premier League or football governing bodies like UEFA or FIFA would need to be onboard with such schemes before they achieve ubiquity.

Perhaps Real will decide to reinvest in other areas and instead promote Marco Asensio to a starring role. Premier League rules now state that third parties – essentially anyone or anything that isn’t a recognised football club – can trade players. Fifa, football’s world governing body, also banned the practice in 2015, though there are reasons to suggest that there are ways round bothFormer England football manager Sam Allardyce was notoriously sacked by the Football Association after he was secretly filmed by reporters claiming that there were ways\u0026nbspto “get around” the rules surrounding third-party ownership.So before any kind of tokenisation of players occurs, rules would need to be changed. Unlike the Tevez and Mascherano saga, however, tokenising footballers would make any issues surrounding the ownership of a player entirely transparent. Tokenisation is already being adopted in other sectors, including the art world. Last month, a multi-million pound work of art by Andy Warhol was auctioned as digital certificates, allowing investors to own a fraction of the iconic Fourteen Small Electric Chairs piece.The platform behind the sale said the first-of-its-kind auction was “democratising access to fine art,” as now “anyone can own a Warhol.” One of the most obvious areas that tokenisation could prove majorly beneficial is property. Property is one of the best investments currently available, but for many, especially large number of millennials looking to get themselves on the property ladder, it is unaffordable.Through tokenisation buyers will have the option to work with investors rather than banks, where the funds can be made more accessible and the approval periods can be much quicker and streamlined. Through tokenisation investors will also be able to ersify their capital by investing in portfolios not inidual properties which will spread the risk and allow for a wider variety of assets.One platform that is already allowing this is HiP, which puts properties on its platform and allows buyers to finance them through investors.Kai Peeters, founder and CEO of HiP Property, told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “Fractionalisation by tokenisation or other means will be particularly beneficial for the property market as it will enable unlocking currently tied up property wealth that owners are sitting on without selling their property or buying into equity release, refinance or bridge loaning products.“All of these things penalise the buyers unfairly by contracting them into increased interest payments or even compound interest loans in case of equity release.” Possibilities beyond football players, art and property are nearly endless. Almost any asset that holds any amount of value could be placed on the blockchain. Ross Peet, a managing partner at the London-based ideas agency Yes\u0026ampPepper says the technology could eliminate vast swathes of bureaucracy by cutting out the need for brokers and other middlemen - while also making transactions quicker, cheaper and more transparent.“The days of trading assets through complex paperwork and red tape could well be numbered as the world is gearing up to embrace blockchain. This introduces the possibility to conduct online transactions of any assets that can be digitised, whether that be a piece of music or deeds to a house, through a trusted, decentralised democratic system,” Mr Peet\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspThe Independent. “If you follow that chain of thought to its ultimate conclusion we could be entering Star Trek territory where the Tokenisation of Everything (TOE) will mean money becomes obsolete and we can exchange anything for anything.

The border guards kept saying ‘how do we know you’re not lying?’“They then said the visa had been denied in May, which we didn’t know. It seemed there was nothing I could say to convince them even though we had a letter from my father-in-law confirming we wouldn’t be claiming welfare.”Mr\u0026nbspBiancardi, an adjunct professor of political science in California, added: The\u0026nbspBorder Force\u0026nbspofficers said they had concerns and made us wait 45 minutes. They then put my wife through a torturous process, taking her into an office on her own, while I had to wait outside for two hours.”His mother had put in an “insane” amount of work into the wedding preparations, including a cake, £11,000 of catering, a photographer and booking the venue, amounting to £20,000, he said.\u0026nbspThe family would not have spent that had the Home Office informed them of the visa refusal decision, he\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspThe 90 guests include 15 friends who have flown over from California for the event.US-trained Mrs Biancardi has already sat a law conversion exam, allowing her to practise in Britain\u0026nbspand her husband is due to begin a master’s degree in sociology at Bristol in September. Now they believe their plans might have to be overturned.“We’re desperate to have the wedding but my biggest priority is not to disappoint my family so I’m thinking of still going there for it, she said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been feeling incredibly depressed.\u0026nbspHer fiance added\u0026nbspthat if there\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspstill no way of her\u0026nbspentering Britain before Sunday’s ceremony, one option is for his father to hold up an iPad with a Skype link on it to France while the groom walks down the aisle.“When we found out the spouse’s visa had been rejected it only left a few days to apply for a visitor’s visa but what are the chances of getting that in time?

(Local protest kept the brand out of the town in 2012.)It’s been called “the capital of New-Age chic”, “the most eccentric town in Britain”, a source of inspiration for artists, writers and therapists, and a cause of rage for at least one visiting rationalist who fulminated against a hotbed of “drop-in Tarot and meditation classes, art healing workshops and psycho-spiritual dance sessions”.And let us continue to pause, because the Totnes passports, which shall be issued to all who are willing to swear the Totnes Oath, are still at the printers.\u0026nbspSomeone spotted an error when they came off the press.This is a pity because Marian and Barry Skeffington have turned up in the hope of becoming the first senior citizens to have their own Totnes passports.Alerted by an early morning news item on Radio Devon, they hot-footed it to the Guildhall determined to be the first in the queue at the Totnes “passport office”\u0026nbsp(which in its current form is more bench than office).“I want mine to have the number one on it,” says Barry, a retired hotel general manager.\u0026nbsp“I have such pride in Totnes.”He and Marian are happy to wait.\u0026nbspWe have time to explain the roles of Brutus of Troy and Passport to Pimlico.Mr Cooper, 55, invites us to consider the Brutus Stone\u0026nbspin nearby Fore Street, and the writings of the monk Geoffrey of Monmouth in the far away 12th\u0026nbspcentury.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina

was, of course, the city state of Troy,” he begins.\u0026nbspAccording to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the wanderings of Brutus of Troy took him, after many adventures, to the River Dart, to a land inhabited only by abundant game and a small band of giants.Here Brutus stepped ashore and declared (while standing on the aforementioned stone): “Here I stand and here I rest, and this good town shall be called Totnes.”Brutus and his followers slew the giants, including their leader Gogmagog.\u0026nbspAnd on this now happy shore they created the second Troy that in due course became the nation named Britain, after Brutus.“We are the inheritors of Troy,” insists Mr Cooper, “and the marvellous thing about the EU is that it adopted our Trojan values\u0026nbsp(defined in the Totnes Oath as “compassion, endeavour, ingenuity, altruism, diligence, daring and a peace-loving commitment to the dignity of all sentient beings”).”But now, says Mr Cooper, Britain wishes to depart from Europe and its Trojan values, so to stay true to its roots, Totnes must remain in the EU by declaring its independence from the UK.And should Theresa May’s government refuse them their independence, the Totnesians will cite the precedent set by the 1949 film Passport to Pimlico, in which a plucky band of Londoners claimed to be in part of Burgundy, as granted by English King Edward IV to Duke Charles “The Rash”.There will be issues to resolve, none more vexing than question asked by Conservative district council leader John Tucker: “Will there be a soft border with Newton Abbot?”But Totnes is the town that slew the giants Gogmagog and Costa Coffee.With right, legal precedent and the spirit of British film comedy on their side, declares Mr Cooper, “Totnes will become a leading entity within the EU.\u0026nbspThe City State of Totnes will very quickly become a very prosperous world leader.”“How are we doing on the passports?” asks Barry hopefully.\u0026nbsp“Any word on the passports?”They’re still at the printers.In the Independent City State of Totnes, explains Mr Cooper, everyone will be listened to, not just the 37 per cent of the electorate\u0026nbspwho voted Leave (as opposed to backing Remain or abstaining).The town’s castle, adds his partner Kevin Childs, an art history lecturer, has the perfect circular shape for a people’s assembly.\u0026nbspThe Guildhall would become the headquarters of the executive.\u0026nbspThe town’s Conservative MP – and GP – Dr Sarah Wollaston, who has already called for a second EU referendum, will, they hope, accept their invitation to become the provisional government’s interim first minister,\u0026nbsp“so Totnes will also have the best healthcare system in the EU”.(When The Independent phoned, the woman in Dr Wollaston’s constituency office laughed.\u0026nbspThen she said the MP was in meetings.)The Totnes national anthem has yet to be composed, but will have “forward-looking” words.\u0026nbspThe city state’s flag has yet to be designed.\u0026nbspThey are also uncertain on whether to adopt the euro or keep the Totnes\u0026nbsppound\u0026nbsp(a local currency started by an eco-charity in 2007).But we know what the passports will look like because, hot off the adjusted presses, they have now arrived.\u0026nbspThey are, of course, in EU red and incorporate the image of Brutus of Troy, plus watermarks depicting a carrot\u0026nbsp(for organic farming), a computer – conceived of\u0026nbspby Totnesian Charles Babbage\u0026nbspin 1837 – and three healing crystals (obviously).\u0026nbspThe Totnes Oath is printed on the back cover.Clutching the first ever passports issued by the Independent City State of Totnes, Marian and Barry are delighted.“This is fun,” says Barry.\u0026nbsp“But I’m not particularly hot either way on Brexit.”Organic innkeeper Geetie Singh-Watson, next in the passport queue, is slightly more on message.“I want to stay in the EU,” says Ms Singh-Watson, of the Bull Inn, who is accompanied by her springer iel Artichoke.\u0026nbsp“This does seem an opportunity to question how we got to this point after a referendum full of false statements.“I swear allegiance to Europe.\u0026nbspAnd so does Artichoke!”There is similar enthusiasm on the high street, at Rhythm and Light (purveyor of “crystals, fossils, world music, instruments”).“I like the idea,” says Rhythm and Light owner Sandi Whale, “because of what it shows up – the lies and skulduggery that got us to Brexit.“It does rather highlight that the government is letting a right-wing cabal dictate to the rest of the country.“Totnes is so different,” she adds.\u0026nbsp“You feel you can do anything here.”But at Earth Food Love, Britain’s first zero-waste supermarket, a note of caution is sounded between the jars of organic puffed quinoa and the grind-your-own almond butter.“It’s amusing,” says Edward Judge, 21, the man behind the counter.\u0026nbsp“But there are not as many radicals here as you might think.”And if you really want to be over-serious, you could try quite a few objections to Mr Cooper’s City State of Totnes plan.For a start, Mr Cooper isn’t just any old lawyer.\u0026nbspHe is a human rights specialist with particular expertise in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.In Brexiteer demonology, that probably places Mr Cooper in first class on “the Brussels gravy train”, clutching a CV slightly worse than Satan’s.Although Mr Cooper doesn’t see it that way.“It is a fiction that lawyers get rich by exploiting EU human rights law,” he says.\u0026nbsp“In fact, if Britain left the EU, I would be richer, because there would be so many complications flowing from Brexit that I would get much more work.“The overwhelming majority of human rights barristers do large amounts of pro bono work,” he adds, “because we represent people who are not wealthy, but who genuinely need legal protection.”The so-called Thatcherite\u0026nbspeconomic miracle, he suggests, was more of an EU miracle resulting from Britain joining a single market now populated by 500 million people: “It only became controversial when they realised they couldn’t have the business model without the social justice model and protections for workers.”But enough about Mr Cooper.\u0026nbspWhat about Geoffrey of Monmouth?\u0026nbspHe didn’t just invent Brutus of Troy.\u0026nbspHe promoted the myth of King Arthur.\u0026nbspGeoffrey of Monmouth could plausibly be described as more fake news than Boris of Battlebus.Mr Cooper bristles, albeit not altogether seriously.“Where do we get the name Britain, if not from Brutus?\u0026nbspIf they are going to stoop to the level of challenging Geoffrey of Monmouth … We have got the Brutus Stone.\u0026nbspWhat more evidence do you need?”It is with some hesitation that The Independent reminds Mr Cooper that the town’s reputation for “crystal waving” – as one jaded local put it – has spawned the oft-repeated joke that Totnes is twinned with Narnia.“The only fantasy land is Brexit,” insists Mr Cooper.Totnes is twinned with Vire, France.\u0026nbspNot Narnia.\u0026nbspIt is accessed via the A38, not a wardrobe.Yet it has to be said that the key problem in establishing the Independent City State of Totnes may prove to be the independent minds of the citizens of Totnes.Visit for example, the fully immersive art installation that is Totnes’s internationally acclaimed Timehouse.\u0026nbspLie on the “flying carpet”\u0026nbspin the Cloud Nine room while watching a projection of Plan 9 from Outer Space.Then listen to Timehouse owner and creator Julie Lafferty.\u0026nbsp“It is fun to have an independent city state,” she says. “When we first created the Timehouse, I wanted to declare this slice of land the Territory of Aeons.“But when it comes to Brexit, I’m neutral.\u0026nbspI think of myself as Switzerland.”There is even more iniduality back on the high street, in the heavily bearded form of Sky, a 41-year-old “gravedigger and one-to-one enabler in mental health”.Women to lose ‘fundamental rights’ because of Brexit, warns reportGovernment admits plan to stockpile medicines if no-deal BrexitThe British people must be given a final say on the Brexit dealLeave, Remain, EU, UK, Independent City State of Totnes: whichever political form you choose, to Sky you are just “deciding what shape you want your chocolate teapot”.The whole debate, he suggests, is a ersion: “It’s all couched in capital, and anything couched in capital is slave to the banks.”But the faith of Mr Cooper remains unshakeable.“And Totnes will be leading the way.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to

This vote must include an option for an exit from Brexit.Vote Leave chief leaks \u0027fake news\u0027 report on misuse of dataOdds on second referendum and no-deal Brexit tumbleThis is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“I congratulate The Independent for joining this campaign. It’s both a brave and correct move.”Labour MP David Lammy, who has called for a second referendum since 2016, said: “The Independent’s new push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal sits, with other similar campaigns, on the right side of history.“Allowing the public to choose whether we remain in the EU – or indeed choose, in full knowledge, to become poorer, less sovereign and diplomatically neutered – is the only democratic solution to this political nightmare.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, campaigner Gina Miller and ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell have also backed the campaign.Theresa May has urged voters not to worry about Brexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March.But as a no-deal Brexit began to look more likely, Mr Blair took to Twitter to give his support to the campaign.He said: “33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines.

Come what may in the months ahead, we maintain our commitment to our readers to retain balance and present many different points of view. But on this subject we believe a referendum on the final deal is right.We believe there are three reasons:1. The people, on both sides of the debate, are losing faith with the current process. From Theresa May to parliament as a whole, a chaotic approach has delivered infighting, resignations and party politics, but little progress on the key issues that people care about.2. The people on both sides should have the chance to finish what they started. With reality coming into focus, it’s only natural to check this future is what people really want. After years of negotiations behind closed doors, the people must not be shut out of the final decision.3. The people – on both sides – know so much more now than we did in 2016. The campaigns – again, on both sides – were flawed and clouded by misinformation. Many myths have been exposed. Now we must check there is support for the facts of Brexit.A full account of The Independent’s view is available here.In 2016, the people were given their say on the principle of whether to stay in the EU or leave. Now the facts are becoming clearer, it’s time for the people to have the final say on the real deal – before it’s too late.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are

beis","story":"Created with Sketch.Committee refuses to rule out protected areas as future sites for UK\u0027s most toxic radioactive materialsClick to followIndy PoliticsThe Lake District has previously been suggested as a potential site for dumping nuclear wasteNuclear waste could be stored in vaults deep underneath national parks after MPs approved a new plan for the UK’s most toxic radioactive materials.The move means protected areas including\u0026nbspnational parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs) would be potential sites for the construction of waste disposal facilities.Getting rid of radioactive waste is a tricky business, and some of the wilder suggestions in the past have included dumping it in the sea and blasting it into space.After efforts to find a home for the UK’s nuclear waste stalled, the government launched a new strategy that has since undergone scrutiny by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee.After hearing evidence from key stakeholders, the committee has released a report in which they refuse to rule out protected areas as potential dumping sites.Environmental groups have reacted with horror to the decision, pointing to the damage such facilities could cause to areas of pristine landscape.\u0026nbspBut the report’s authors concluded that given the incredibly dangerous nature of the material in question “it is right for safety matters to prevail over environmental concerns in this case”.Hood Hill and Roulston Scar as seen from Sutton Bank1323 Valley of Rocks, ExmoorMt Tryfan and the Ogwen

FachThurne Mill on a misty afternoonWhile giving evidence to the committee, energy minister Richard Harrington compared the idea to a proposed potash mine near Whitby in North Yorkshire, which is within a national park.“I am not saying we should have them on national parks, but it would be very wrong to exclude them at the moment in this big policy statement,” he said.Nuclear reactors generate around a fifth of the UK’s electricity, but almost half of the current infrastructure will no longer be in use by 2025 as old plants are decommissioned.Government advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, have made it clear that nuclear power plants will be a key component in meeting carbon emission targets,\u0026nbspand major new plants are in development.However, ministers have struggled to find communities willing to play host to nuclear waste facilities.Cumbria was a prime candidate, with some suggesting the radioactive materials could end up in the Lake District, but these efforts stalled in 2013.This led to the government laying out a draft national policy statement in January detailing its approach to geological disposal infrastructure (GDI) – the systems of vaults and tunnels required to store the most toxic radioactive material that cannot be stored above ground.The committee said they supported the government’s view “that it is conceivable for a GDI to be designed in a way that would be acceptable to communities, preserve the socioeconomic benefits that national parks and AONBs currently bring them and avoid any intrusive surface facility in conservation areas”.However, environmental groups said they hoped the government would reconsider this position.No-deal Brexit could see \u0027electricity generators on barges in sea\u0027UK

National Parks, gave evidence to the committee in July, and said it was “completely wrong” to use the Yorkshire potash development as justification.“The proposed nuclear storage facility is completely contrary to the purposes of national parks and we are extremely disappointed that the committee has failed to recognise this,” she said.“Excluding national parks and AONBs as possible locations would support the Government’s ambitions for these areas as set out in the 25 year environment plan.”Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, said the thought of burying nuclear waste in national parks was “outrageous” and said it was evidence the government should not invest in further nuclear infrastructure.“The future is in clean, renewable energy like wind and solar, she said.BEIS did not

Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In Balochisan, BAP won 13 seats out of the 65 while Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) was in second place with nine. Who will eventually form the government in Balochistan is unclear as the BNP, BNP-Awami, Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) have won six, three and two seats respectively, while PTI has won four.In Punjab, Pakistan\u0027s largest province, the Muslim Leaque took 129 out of 295 seats with the PTI close behind with 123, while 28 independent assembly members will play a potentially vital role in forming the government.\u0026nbspWe will definitely form our government in Punjab as we are in contact with 21 independent candidates, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhary saidThe poll has been marred by long delays in counting and complaints of rigging by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.The party’s spokesman, Muhammad Mehndi, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe majority” of the elected members were “in favour of boycotting the oath of the assembly” and backed agitating against the election. There is no other opinion except that election is rigged,\u0026nbsphe said.Some of the smaller religious parties are threatening street protests if the poll is not re-run.We have decided to organise a movement to press for fresh elections, as the \u0027manipulated\u0027 results are not acceptable to us, MMA president Fazlur Rehman said.PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he was outraged by the killing of a party member in the northern city of Mansehra and that demanding a recount was a party\u0027s legal right. He did not specify when the party member was killed.PML-N is a peaceful national political party and fear \u0026amp intimidation can\u0027t suppress our rights, Mr Sharif tweeted.Mr Khan has offered to investigate any claims of irregularities in the wake of Wednesday\u0027s poll, which Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N and several other parties allege was skewed in favour of the former cricket hero by Pakistan\u0027s powerful military.European Union observers were critical of the political climate in the run up to the vote, saying that some parties had been disadvantaged. In their preliminary findings, the observers said the electoral process was not as good as the 2013 election and campaign week featured a lack of equality that meant it was not a level playing field for all parties.\u0026nbspThe US voiced similar concerns.We have concluded there was a lack of equality of opportunity, German MEP Michael Gahler said.A number of violent attacks, targeting political parties, party leaders, candidates and election officials, affected the campaign environment.“Most interlocutors acknowledged a systematic effort to undermine the former ruling party through cases of corruption, contempt of court and terrorist charges against its leaders and candidates.”Mr Khan\u0027s 116 seats put\u0026nbsphim short of the 137 required for an assembly majority, meaning he is likely to need a coalition with religious parties and independents to form a government.Two newly formed small parties are seen as being open to an alliance with Mr Khan\u0027s PTI.The GDA, a new alliance in Sindh province, has two seats.BAP, another new group formed by a number of seasoned political names from the southwesterly Baluchistan province, picked up four seats.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Saturday released results for 270 seats, with elections in two seats postponed. Several were being recounted.The coalition arithmetic is slightly complicated by the fact that a further 70 seats, most reserved for women and members of non-Muslim minorities, are allocated to parties on the basis of their performance in the contested constituencies. Once those seats are added in, any coalition will need at least 172 seats.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/secondary/Brexit-Ireland-1440029.jpg","title":"brexit news ireland irish border hard brexit stockpiling medicine","story":"If the UK quits the bloc without securing a deal with the EU it could lead to uncertainty over the supply of drugs, Leo Varadkar has warned.The Irish taoiseach (prime minister) said one year ago the situation was \u0026ldquoa low probability but the threat was now seen as a serious \u0026ldquoconcern.It is the latest attempt by the Irish leader to pressure Mrs May into agreeing to a Brexit deal with the EU - something hardline Brexiteers worry could tie the UK to the bloc and leave it a vassal state.He said: There is potentially a concern around medicines, both because a lot of our supply chains go through the United Kingdom.

They will go on whinging and whining and moaning all the way through this process.New Labours former EU trade commissioner Lord Mandelson has said a second referendum on memberships to the European bloc could strengthen Theresa Mays hand and allow her to stand up against Brextremists blackmail.He also dismissed the notion that what we lose in Europe we can easily pick up from the likes of India and China in any post-Brexit trade deal.He added: Of course, the Brextremists will call this undemocratic – that’s what they call anything that doesn’t help them get their own way.But the referendum two years ago instructed the government to start a negotiation for EU exit.“It didn’t give it the right to make a shambles of the whole process, to be taken hostage by the Brextremists and then dish up a completely unsatisfactory outcome and demand that the country accepts it, whatever the cost.”A poll carried out for Sky Data indicated the British public were losing faith in Theresa May administration in negotiating a Brexit deal.It found that two-thirds of the public, including a majority of Leave voters, think the outcome of negotiations with the EU will be bad for Britain.The poll also found that most people would like to see a referendum giving a choice of the governments proposed Chequers deal, no deal and remaining in the EU.The public also appeared to have little faith in the abilities of May, with 74 percent saying they were dissatisfied with her performance.Despite polls suggesting a majority of party members would back a second vote, Labour is not calling for one, though it has not ruled it out.Deputy Leader Tom Watson said that while calling for a public vote was still “highly unlikely” it couldn’t be ruled out.Mr Watson added the huge splits in the Tory Party meant it was now hard to see any majority in the Commons for any particular Brexit agreement.The first referendum on EU membership took place in 1975.Two-thirds of voters (67.23 per cent) backed the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a different version of EEC membership to get a better deal.Turnout was 64.62 per cent, compared to the 72.2 per cent in the most recent 2016 EU referendum.Only Shetland and the Western Isles voted against the EEC in the countrys first nationwide referendum.The result was later hailed by Prime Minister Harold Wilson a historic decision.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in 1993.In the summer of 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU after 17.4million people backed Leave comapred to 16.1million Remain voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Mrs May would not survive breaching her own red line on this.Going back on her word would spark more Brexit ministers resigning from Government, making her position untenable.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some of it is common sense.It makes no sense that ferry or rail passengers don’t have to give the same basic info to the Authorities as plane arrivals do.It should go without saying that failed asylum seekers should be sent home quickly, without endless costly judicial reviews at taxpayers’ expense.And to avoid another Windrush scandal we must give official papers to those who have been here for years — especially Ugandan Asians, who came in the ’70s and are most likely to be without. Other recommendations require a bit more thought.But at least Policy Exchange are doing some thinking about Britain’s future. On the other hand, the Government is turning drift into an art form.  Even the much-ballyhoed, super-charged no deal plans that were supposed to be released one-by-one this summer are being quietly shuffled away until one day in late August.Former Brexit Minister Steve Baker is right to be “alarmed and worried” .The PM’s Chequers fudge is a direct result of our lack of planning, and until we’re ready to go it alone, Brussels will force us to make more concessions.

Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

Did you lend the jacket to somebody else?” Baron Cohen asked.Moore angrily said he had been married for 33 years and had “never had an accusation of such things”.“Certainly, I’m not a paedophile,” he said. “Maybe Israeli technology hasn’t developed properly.”The judge then promptly stormed out of the interview.Moore is just the latest politician to fall victim to the pranksters actions.Last week a Georgia state representative resigned after being tricked into shouting the n-word and exposing his bum to turn a terrorist gay.Jason Spencer, 43, was ordered to go by senior members of both parties following the embarrassing display .Baron Cohen also takes aim at the media and political correctness.The comedian poses as a pony-tailed liberal radio reporter on a post-2016 election cycling tour, and a man in a disability scooter who purports to investigate fake news.In the first episode, Baron Cohens radio journalist persona is shown dining at the home of two Trump supporters in South Carolina and regaling them with lurid stories about his supposed family.It comes after Cohen was slammed by Sarah Palin, 54, when he apparently posed as a wounded military veteran to dupe her into taking part in the show.Palin, the former governor of Alaska, revealed she will feature in the satirical comedy series, while branding his humour “exploitive” and “sick”.In a scathing Facebook post she alleged Cohen pretended to be wheelchair-bound to convince her he was a wounded former serviceman.She wrote: Yup - we were duped.

This is potentially damaging. We have too much secrecy as it is.”Buerk also criticised judges for failing to take into account social media and the rise of fake news and called on Parliament to make privacy laws.He said: “ The world has changed, even if judges haven’t noticed. In the cacophony of social media everything is everywhere anyway, suspects would be named almost instantly, however much you bind the steam-age media limping along behind.“The line between privacy and freedom is one of the most important decisions a civilised society has to make. It’s time it was drawn by parliament and not left to be worked out piecemeal by judges on the basis of individual cases.”Buerk, who shot to fame with his reports from Ethiopia’s famine in 1984, he said he was pleased the BBC had reported the raid at Sir Cliff’s house because it showed “the juices were still flowing.”He said: “Journalism is not the priesthood, even at the BBC. I’m pleased that the juices are still flowing at an organisation that can often look flatulent, bureaucratic and complacent. Great that the newsroom can still “go bananas” over a “cracking story” – even if it wasn’t.”He also questioned whether police should spend so much time investigating when there was a knife, gun and violent crime epidemic. He said: “They’ve got better things to do.”The BBC has agreed to pay Sir Cliff Richard £850,000 towards his legal costs within 14 days, following his privacy case against the corporation.

Try watching BBC2’s Stewart Lee: Content Provider, which was recorded live at the town’sPalace Theatre, in April. You’ll be biting your own tail off within three minutes.For if you’re not familiar with him, “Stew,” as he affectionately calls himself, is another of those left-wing comedians who sincerely believes his material is driven by his own overwhelming compassion, despite the fact he seems obsessed with money and clearly hates everyone and almost everything.This includes other far more successful comedians, like Michael McIntyre, their audience, his own audience, the Daily Mail, Tories, “posh men”, Donald Trump and, of course, Brexit.The thing Stewart Lee clearly despises the most, however, is himself.’Cos he can hide behind a persona all he likes, he’s smart enough to know he is just another privately educated Oxbridge graduate telling the people what they should think.He’s also, technically, a very talented comedian, who made me howl with laughter for about as long as he was impersonating Russell Howard.All the cleverly ­inter-woven observations in the world, though, are meaningless if a comedian cannot disguise his own unpleasantness and opens the show, as Lee did, pushing the same foul-mouthed party line you could hear from a thousand other useless, BBC-approved stand-ups.“It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe . . . c***s did as well.

We have carried out seven simulator tests, flight simulators, three at high and four at low speed and we found the turn was made indeed under a manual, not autopilot.”Dr Kok said the investigators examined the history of the pilot and the first officer and were satisfied with their background, training and mental health.A 2017 report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau showed that pilot Zaharie had used his own flight simulator six weeks before the crash to fly a route which was initially similar to the one taken by MH370.However, Malaysian authorities concluded that the flight simulations were game-related and that there was was no unusual activities on the simulator.The final report today said that the co-pilots flight simulator was seized from his home but that nothing suspicious was found on it.Kok said his team “couldn’t find any flaws with the aircraft” and that “everything seemed OK” with it.He added that the cause of the disappearance cannot be determined until the plane and its black boxes are found, saying the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found.The report said there was no sign the plane was evading radar detection or that it was taken over by remote control.No irregularities were found in the on-board cargo, which included items like lithium batteries and about 2,500 kgs of mangosteen which is a tropical fruit.The independent investigation report highlighted shortcomings in the governments response.Dr Kok said the probe showed lapses by air traffic control, including a failure to swiftly initiate an emergency response and monitor radar continuously, relying too much on information from Malaysia Airlines and not getting in touch with the military for help.The plane is presumed to have crashed in the far southern Indian Ocean.However, the report said there was insufficient information to determine if the aircraft broke up in the air or during impact with the ocean.Scattered pieces of debris that washed ashore on African beaches and Indian Ocean islands indicated a distant remote stretch of the ocean where the plane likely crashed.But a government search by Australia, Malaysia and China failed to pinpoint a location.And a second, private search by US company Ocean Infinity that finished at the end of May also found no sign of the wreckage.Hard copies of the long-awaited and unedited report were distributed to families of those on-board the flight earlier today.Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said the team also briefed relatives of the victims on the report at the transport ministry.However, next of kin looked distraught after receiving the report while insisting the document offered them “no closure”,  reports.Many of the heartbroken relatives reportedly said some of the information contained in the report was incorrect.Others reported that while there were no major surprises the report contained more details as to the extent in which Air Traffic Control allegedly “messed up”.Captain Zaharies friend Peter Chong, who is also a pilot, said in a Facebook post that he feels disappointment over the report and the lack of closure for the grieving relatives.He wrote: I feel sad for the Next of Kin (NOK) of MH370. After all the hype and expectations, the Report released brings forth nothing new.They are no where near to closure.Just another round in the emotional rollercoaster ride.I am happy to note there is no blame apportioned to anyone.However, there is also no answers as to what happened to the flight.Earlier, Mr Loke told reporters that “every word recorded by the investigation team (has been) tabled in this report”.“It (was) tabled fully, without any editing, additions, or redactions,” he said.Grace Nathan, whose mother was on the flight, responded to the release of the report on Facebook. “Just because they call it a final report doesn’t mean it’s over for the next of kin,” she wrote today.“The search must go on. There can be no final report until MH370 is found.”On May 29, Malaysia called off a three-month search by Ocean Infinity, which spanned 43,243 sq miles in the southern Indian Ocean and ended with no significant findings.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with 239 people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at 12.14am on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH370 close to Phuket island, Thailand, in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around 1,000 miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Malaysian captain Zaharie Amad Shah was flying MH370 when it disappeared.Shah, born July 31, 1961, was described as a veteran pilot who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981.A father of three, passionate cook and keen fisherman, Shah lived with his wife in a luxury gated community where he was said to have built his own flight simulator.In the wake of the planes disappearance, rumours surfaced claiming his wife had moved out of their home.The co-pilot was Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was on his first flight on a 777 as a fully approved first officer.He had flown five times before with a check co-pilot overseeing him.But he had 2,763 hours experience flying other jets before moving to the larger aircraft.Fariq was reportedly planning to marry his girlfriend."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004193166301.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"foreign aid jobs perv magnets","story":"The International Development Committee said delivering aid to the most needy is an “attractive sector for people wishing to exploit others” in a damning analysis of the sector.MPs said charity aid bosses have “collectively failed” to tackle “the horror of sexual exploitation and abuse” over many years.

No matter how insurmountable this looks, solutions must be found. This horror must be confronted.”Last night International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said urgent action was needed from the sector ahead of an international summit in October.She said: “Until the sector is fully prepared to address the power imbalance, cultures, and behaviours that allow sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment to happen, we will never stamp it out.“Ensuring that survivors’ voices are heard and taken seriously is paramount.”MPs are calling for a global register for aid workers to help screen outknown sexual predators. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Number 10 did not roll the pitch for this compromise, by, for example, getting the PM to promise car or aviation workers that their jobs would be protected.The Clean or Hard Brexiteers feel the red lines that she herself announced have been betrayed.But having staked out a fairly hard line initially, the PM has not now persuaded Remain leaning voters to be thankful for her attempt at compromise.She has not sold Chequers.

It brought record-breaking viewing figures for ITV2, with the launch show in June attracting the channel\u0027s largest ever audience with 2.9 million viewers.That figure was topped just a few weeks into the run, with three million viewers tuning in mid-week.But why is it so successful? An idyllic location (Majorca), beautiful contestants and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week) certainly gave the show a boost from the start.BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling\u0027s quippy voiceover also helps to lubricate the on-screen action.Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University before going on to present children\u0027s TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore - who apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis.And she\u0027s not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance during last year\u0027s series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show.American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: \"@LoveIsland Jack \u0026 Dani are goals! 😍 #LoveIsland\". There\u0027s even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give the show a little star dust, with Danny Dyer\u0027s daughter Dani (yes, really) eventually justifying her status as favourite to win.Dani and pen salesman Jack Fincham have been coupled since the start, and say they plan to move in together now the show has come to an end.The popular pair have even received the thumbs up from The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thanks to Jack\u0027s penchant for bird watching during his time in the villa. Winning an A* for ingenuity, the show\u0027s producers even managed to wangle an appearance of sorts from Daddy Dyer over the weekend.The always awkward meeting of boyfriend and father was given an extra excruciating twist, with Jack meeting the EastEnders actor over Facetime.Luckily the soap star, who was speaking from his family holiday in Florida, said he \"approved\" of Fincham, telling him \"I think you\u0027re absolutely bang on\" and a \"proper geezer\".He also told him he had a bit of a belly using cockney rhyming slang - a classic Dyer move. Viewers were quick to share their love for Danny\u0027s appearance on social media, hailing it the best moment of the series so far.The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it is not just Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries.Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, the UK show even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show and paving the way for the current series\u0027 success.Thorpe Park has opened its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer.And more than one university student has written a dissertation on the reality show.Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right.The show even had its own underdog.Unlucky in love Alex, an A\u0026E doctor from Wales, won the hearts of the nation before being dumped from the villa just one day before the final. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: \"It\u0027s the first series I\u0027ve ever watched, but I\u0027m addicted. It\u0027s the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people\u0027s lives - into relationships which are normally secret.

And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day.\" The world, it seems, cannot get enough.With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas.A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night\u0027s antics - presented by Kem Cetinay, one half of last year\u0027s winning couple, and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year.A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: \"It\u0027s a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to - the uncertainty, the lust, the love.\"Last year\u0027s show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that\u0027s why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you\u0027re always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn\u0027t work out for some of them.\" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: \"It\u0027s really important that it\u0027s not a salacious show - that it isn\u0027t grubby.\"Stavri also puts its success down to \"not being full of conflict\" and the fact \"it doesn\u0027t feel exploitative\".When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don\u0027t cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension.Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show \"aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love\".However, Cowles goes on: \"If people don\u0027t like it they don\u0027t have to watch. We\u0027re not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that\u0027s a distraction from real life.\"Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island\u0027s launch night viewers were aged 16-34.Only Britain\u0027s Got Talent - shown on ITV\u0027s main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Arielle Free says the show\u0027s success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: \"I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It\u0027s such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible.\"It\u0027s also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen.If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-ryanair-frankfurt_4361649.jpg?20180714110856 ","title":"more ryanair cancellations loom as german pilots vote to strike","story":"Last week, the Irish carrier cancelled more than 600 flights, affecting more than 100,000 passengers, as it faced disputes by pilots and crews in Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Spain and Portugal.It also threatened to move aircraft and jobs out of Ireland after pilots walked out for the third day of strikes.Forsa, the union representing Irish pilots, responded by calling another strike on 3 April and warned more would follow.Chief operations officer Peter Bellew said: \"The 20 cancelled flights next Friday cannot be recovered even if this unnecessary (4th) strike is called off.\"\"We hope Forsa will accept our invitationg to meet either next Saturday (4th) or any day the following week, as long as no more strikes are called while we meet, and no Aer Lingus pilots are involved in these negotiations.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-philip-may_4375812.jpg?20180730133117 ","title":"theresa may dismisses calls for second brexit referendum in wake of sky data poll","story":"But Downing Street reiterated its opposition to any further public vote on Brexit.Asked about Lord Mandelson\u0027s comments on Monday, the prime minister\u0027s spokesman said there would be \"no second referendum in any circumstances\".

Local authority spending on youth services has fallen by 52% in real terms since 2012, according to Labour figures compiled by the House of Commons Library. Meanwhile, knife crime has increased by 19% in the last year alone. Labour say delivering solid youth services would give young people the support they need, and prevent them from being exploited by gangs and falling into a life of crime. Cat Smith said: “The Government has left youth services across the country devastated after eight years of unnecessary and unjustified austerity.  “With youth services targeted for budget cuts, the Tories have created the conditions in which crime can thrive, leaving young people vulnerable to violence and denied the opportunity to build a positive future. “Enough is enough. Today, we are launching our consultation on a statutory youth service which outlines a bold vision of what a Labour government will achieve. “I urge anyone who wants to improve the opportunities available to young people to get involved.

Four out of five medics quizzed in a poll fear for the future of the service once we leave the EU next year. There are concerns a brain drain of European NHS staff will deepen the recruitment crisis. An array of treatments, especially cancer care, could also be negatively affected. Imports of vital drugs such as insulin could be badly hit and investment in research and funding slashed. One medic said the London School of Hygiene and \u0026shyTropical \u0026shyMedicine survey results did not surprise him. Dr William Sapwell added: “My impression from the front line is everyone knows it’s going to be bad. It affects every little corner of the NHS. “We have recruitment and retention problems for doctors and if you put a barrier in front of seven to 10% of the \u0026shyworkforce, it will get far worse. “It’s going to massively affect our ability to treat and detect some types of cancer. That’s the scariest part.  “There is also a real risk we will run out of insulin.” Survey lead author Dr Kate \u0026shyMandeville said: “Doctors are among the best-placed people to understand the impact of political decisions on the NHS. “On Brexit their opinion is very clear: Brexit is bad for the nation’s health.” Labour MP Dr Paul Williams said: “Last week the Health Secretary admitted the NHS is s\u0026shytockpiling drugs, and we know if we leave the \u0026shyEuropean Medicines Agency we will join the back of the queue for new drugs.” The British Medical \u0026shyAssociation has called for the public to have a say on the terms of the final Brexit deal. Dr Andrew Dearden, of the BMA, said: “Doctors are worried Brexit could seriously undermine the healthcare.” The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, also found 79% of doctors voted Remain. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We have continued to work closely with the EU to ensure minimal disruption to the NHS.” Half of Brits want second vote... with choice to stay put Half of Britons yesterday said they would now support a second EU referendum. An online poll of 1,466 Sky customers found 50% wanted another vote with three options – supporting the final deal, leaving without a deal, or staying in the EU. But 45% voted against and No10 insisted there would be no referendum.  Best for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd said: “The public are tired of being spoken for. They don’t want a deal full of concessions, or a nightmare no deal. It’s crucial to have a people’s vote with the option to stay in the EU.” Tory infighting over Brexit continued yesterday. One Cabinet source said of Theresa May’s Chequers plan: “It is a kamikaze approach to no deal. It’s chaos.” The Tories yesterday denied claims the Army was on standby to hand out food if a doomsday no-deal Brexit happens. Lack of immigration policy risks creating a bad vaccum Theresa May’s failure to outline a post-Brexit immigration policy has created a dangerous vacuum, MPs warn today. The Commons Home Affairs Committee is urging the Government to set out plans for who will be allowed to come to the UK.

Sandy chip \u0026shybutties and a plastic beaker of warm, diluted orange squash in this gem of a resort were the long summer \u0026shyholidays of my salad days. We didn’t need to travel far – only a few miles on a bus – which was just as well when there was mam, dad and six kids, carrying bags galore stuffed with towels, rugs, flasks of tea and buttered bread, a windbreak, tent and football. I might not have fully appreciated it then, but we were fortunate to live in a friendly town on the glorious golden coast of North East England. And they’re still coming in their \u0026shythousands from near and far to enjoy their happy seaside outings in sunny South Shields. Just like the charabanc up the A19 from Middlesbrough, 50 miles to the south on Teesside. Back on the beaches with a bucket and spade, I bumped into a couple of coachloads of Smoggies from Newport Primary. Kids, parents and teachers from the school all on an annual jaunt to stunning South Shields.  “We love the seaside,” smiled head Tricia McGill, “and when the sun’s shining, you can’t beat it here.” The truth is, I hadn’t chosen the best day of a glorious summer to return to my childhood haunts for our series celebrating the Great British Seaside this week. Nor had Newport Primary, for the school’s regular excursion. “We picked the day for it,” Tricia smiled again, a little more forced this time. “We put up the gazebo and held it down for three hours before the wind defeated us. But, as you can see, everybody’s still having a great time.” And they were. Dozens of children with mams, dads, carers, relatives, and the school staff, who I found huddled in their coats on their chairs. Nobody looked as if they were having a better time of it than ice cream-licking five-year-old Priya Singh. What does she like best about Shields? “Playing in the fair,” she says. The huge fairground – with its dodgems, ghost train, waltzer, roller-coaster and amusement arcades, all a bucket of sand’s throw from the south beach – is a huge attraction.  Friends Harriet Frazer and Lizzie Campbell are sitting in their fold-up chairs on the beach. “We come often to talk and look and listen,” says Harriet, 81, who lives nearby and worked in a jewellery shop before retirement. Lizzie, 65, a vicar in Jarrow before she retired, adds: “I love being by the sea. The place puts things in perspective. And I like to swim.” “Oooh, not me,” jumps in Harriet. “I’ll watch her. But I do like to get my feet wet, so I have a plodge.” [That’s paddling to those of you not brought up in the North East.] South Shields might not be as famous as grand Scarborough down the coast, or as \u0026shycelebrated as Whitby with its wonderful Dracula myth, but it’s one of the great British seaside’s sparkling jewels. The town is in the middle of a \u0026pound100million regeneration, which has already seen the building of National Centre for the Written Word, and the revamp of the market square to host food, craft and farmers’ stalls. The second stage will see a new transport hub, as well as more shops and leisure facilities. The local authority calculates that \u0026pound80million of public and private investment has improved the resort over the past 10 years, with more still to be spent. As youngsters, we’d go to the beach or a park most weekends in the summer holidays. There was my dad John, a miner and mam Jennie, a Wright’s Biscuits factory worker and cleaner. My older siblings, Christine and Lynn, my younger brothers, David and Stephen, and my little sister, Julie.  The locals are known as Sandancers or Sandies. According to one account, it’s after folk who danced on the sand after rescuing crews and goods from ships that ran aground in storms. The two Blue Flag sandy beaches – separated by a mile-long pier guarding the southern mouth of the River Tyne – and the fair are just for starters. There’s also a new indoor swimming pool, a steam train, a boating lake, and Arbeia – a Roman fort guarding the sea route to Hadrian’s Wall. Then there are miles of stunning cliffs, and The Leas – a glorious green haven the council had the foresight to gift to the National Trust, to prevent Tory governments in London trying to sell it off for housing. You’d need to travel a long way to buy a tastier ice cream than the cones at Minchella’s, an Italianate parlour. Or to find better fish and chips than those at the renowned Colmans, with its pictures of famous visitors on the walls, including Tony Blair. The same is true of the curry houses down Ocean Road, which opened when most of Britain thought tinned spaghetti hoops were exotic. Shields’ most famous visitor ever was Muhammad Ali. In 1977, history’s greatest boxer pulled in bigger crowds than the Queen on her Silver Jubilee tour, when he had a marriage blessing in the Laygate mosque. The town’s century-old Yemeni community dates from when the port was filled with steamers, and the coal mines and \u0026shyshipyards provided work for tens of thousands. The pits are gone, and shipbuilding too, but \u0026shymanufacturing remains a bedrock of the local economy.

But he was fuming when they turned up more than an hour-and-a-half late and did not apologise. The chef, originally from Middlesbrough, playfully arranged the two scoops of ice cream together and then squirted on the chocolate sauce in a sausage shape - creating a phallic shape for those looking carefully. Despite his cheeky stunt being spotted by colleagues while serving, it appeared to go unnoticed by the customers who ate it without complaint.  Anton, who has been head chef at the unnamed venue for seven months, said: A large party of 60 people were booked in. When such a large group are booked in we can\u0027t serve food to anyone else so had to close to the general public. We only have a tiny kitchen and there was only myself in there so three courses for 60 people is a massive job for one person. But they turned up an hour and a half late and offered no apologies or anything like that and they were a bit of a nightmare. So I decided to have a bit of fun. They had asked for ice cream and stipulated that they wanted it in a big bowl rather than the small tubs we traditionally serve them in. But in a big bowl there is a lot of space left and obviously they also wanted chocolate sauce on it.

Siobhan Blackhurst and Damon Gilbert were still feeling the effects of a heavy party at their home the night before and decided to go out to drink it off. Dad-of-five Gilbert, 31, pushed the 16-month-old child home in a pram after a five-hour drinking spree in a beer garden, but was so intoxicated he was staggering and could barely open his eyes. The youngster, who almost fell out of the pushchair, was filthy, hadn\u0027t had a nappy change and was was taken off Gilbert by neighbours, who called the cops.  Police found the child\u0027s mum Blackhurst, 29, still drinking two hours after Gilbert left the pub. The pair\u0027s house in nearby Colne reeked of alcohol and was littered with bottles, the court heard. Gilbert said he had downed lager and Sambuca the night before and told a probation officer he had still been drunk. Magistrates in Burnley heard Blackhurst, who claimed the child had been properly looked after throughout the day, put the tot\u0027s state down to the fact the infant had been eating Wotsits and was covered in them. The couple, who are both jobless, on benefits, and have alcohol problems, were spared jail after the Bench said they needed support. Gilbert and Blackhurst, who have been together six years, were said to have stopped drinking since the incident and had referred themselves for treatment. Philippa White, prosecuting, told the hearing the defendants were pushing the child past the Market Tavern, on Market Street, Colne, at around 11am, when the landlady was opening up the premises.  She heard Gilbert say: Should we go in here for one?  The prosecutor said: They went in the premises and remained there the rest of the afternoon, until around 4pm. They were drinking most of that time in the beer garden. The child was with them at all times. Mrs White said about 4pm, the landlady was concerned about how drunk Gilbert was and suggested he should go home. He left in a highly intoxicated state with the child in a pram and Blackhurst stayed in the pub. Gilbert made his way back to their home and knocked on some neighbours\u0027 door.

The shocking life expectancy gap in Stockton-on-Tees, in County Durham, is laid bare in a BBC documentary highlighting the desperation of those facing ill health and death from a comparatively early age. According to Public Health England, Stockton is the town with the country\u0027s largest gap in health and life expectancy.  A man can expect to live to 64, the same age as a man in Ethiopia. Rob Hill, a father of eight, tells interviewers that he is preparing for death at 46 after being diagnosed with numerous health problems. He suffers from emphysema, lymphedema and type 2 diabetes - among other health conditions.  Rob claims poor life choices, including an unhealthy diet and a lifetime of smoking, has left him with a bleak future. Speaking to BBC\u0027s Panorama , Rob said: I\u0027ve made a few bad choices. Smoking - the worst choice I ever made in my life. Seeing my kids cry, that\u0027s horrible. Seeing them sitting there and crying and listening to my children turn around and say, \u0027my dad is going to die soon and I\u0027m not going to play with him any more\u0027. Rob\u0027s eight-year-old son Harvey told the investigative programme: When dad comes into the kitchen, I just see him coughing all the time.  And then I just end up going away. I don\u0027t stay in the kitchen. I don\u0027t know, like no-one ever knows when he\u0027s going to be gone. No one does, not even the doctor. Rob goes on to describe how his younger children are used to playing with him while he is hooked up to breathing apparatus at home. In his hometown, those living in wealthier areas can live 18 years longer than those living in poorer parts of the town, according to national statistics. While nationwide, a boy born in a wealthy part of England could expect to live over eight years longer than a boy born in a more deprived part of the country.

Alessandro Iembo, 28, Martin Neil and Franco-Lorenzo, 40, allegedly paid \u0026pound128,500 in cash to hire a private jet as they pretended to be cryptocurrency leaders on their way to meet the singer in Colombia last December. The three men, alongside Neil\u0027s brother Stephen Neil, 53 and Jose Ramon Miguelez-Botas, 56, are charged with prohibition in relation to a class A controlled drug after border force agents stopped them on a second flight from Bogota in January. When booking the private jet for the earlier trip, the woman who paid the man who ran Diamonte Jets - a chartered jet service provider - gave him \u0026pound128,500 in cash for three passengers. Prosecuting Kerry Maylin told jurors: She said they were leaders in the field of cryptocurrency, they were involved in the music industry and that her clients would be meeting Bruno Mars in Colombia. Subsequent checks revealed the singer had been in the South American country at that time.  As part of the booking, it was also asked that a luxury chauffeur driven Rolls-Royce Phantom car collect the men upon their return to Farnborough. It was to take them to an address in Bromley, south east London. Jurors heard when the three men returned to the UK on December 11, they landed with a number of suitcases but it cannot be said for certain what was in the luggage as they were not stopped. Prosecutors claim the group hid drugs in a suitcase underneath dirty children\u0027s clothes when they were caught.  They were arrested in January at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire after allegedly flying in from the South American country\u0027s capital of Bogota. In the dock at Woolwich Crown Court are brothers Stephen Neil, 53, and Martin Neil, 49, both from Poole, Dorset. They deny one count of fraudulent evasion of a prohibition in relation to a class A controlled drug, between October 30 2017 and January 30 2018.

Liz Marsh, 28, became of the one of the youngest patients in the UK to be diagnosed with mouth cancer after the ulcer on her tongue tripled in size in the space of four weeks. She underwent urgent life-saving surgery to remove the growth and surgeons also had to cut off a third of her tongue. During the same 14-hour operation they used skin, muscle arteries and veins taken from her arm to rebuild the muscular organ.  Brave Liz, is now cancer free but has had to learn to talk, eat and smile again. She said: “I was shocked when surgeons explained that skin, muscle, veins and nerves from my arm would rebuild my tongue. “When I first spotted the ulcer in my mouth I thought nothing of it. “But when it started to become painful and grew, I raised my concerns to my dentist.  “They told me to come back in four weeks and after visiting my doctor, it was dismissed as being a harmless ulcer. “My son, Charlie, now two, had undergone heart surgery at the time and we all thought it was stress related. “But my dentist referred me for tests and a few weeks later I had a biopsy. “I was told just over a week later that I had mouth cancer, by which point the ulcer had turned black.  “Thankfully my consultant at Princess Royal Hospital in Telford was amazing and he reassured me that I could be fixed. “I had a lot of muscle and veins removed from my arm so they could help rebuild my tongue. “It was a complex surgery but I was out of hospital 11 days later. I had been fed through a tube for the entire time I was in hospital and I had to try and relearn to eat once I left.  “For months after my surgery I struggled to smile as my mouth felt numb but now I’m embracing my imperfections. “I also needed speech and language therapy. It was really swollen for a long time but eventually I started to enjoy eating again.” Liz, from Shrewsbury, Shrops, was initially diagnosed in October 2016 but underwent further surgery in May. She added: “My new tongue was quite bulky so I needed it to be trimmed back once all the swelling had settled.  “I hope being open with my story helps others seek help, if it saves one person’s life then it’s worthwhile. “If you have an ulcer, white patches or a lump in your mouth then make sure you get it checked.” “Doctors were shocked when I was diagnosed as I was so young but it shows it can happen to anyone. “Due to my age I have recovered well from surgery and hopefully I will remain cancer free for the next few years so I’m given the all clear. “I currently have check-ups every eight weeks but this will be extended the longer I’m in remission.

His heartbroken dad wrote on Facebook that Corrie was last tracked to near a landfill site and is now somewhere in the Suffolk waste disposal system. The police investigation into his disappearance was shelved by detectives in March. But for many, the mystery of what happened to the 23-year-old is anything but solved. His family accept he was probably crushed and his body left in landfill after climbing into a recycling bin which was later collected by a Biffa lorry. But they blasted the “glaring errors, mistruths and downright lies” reported as fact which plagued the police operation.  Dad Martin, 49, said: “I’ve nothing but praise for the officers who’ve searched tirelessly for Corrie. But the investigation has been plagued with problems. Now I’ll never find exactly what happened to my beloved son.” Mum Nicola has also campaigned tirelessly since Corrie vanished in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk aged 23 in September 2016. Det Supt Katie Elliott said: “It’s extremely disappointing we haven’t been able to find him.” A cold-case unit will take over, as revealed in the Daily Mirror when we also told how Martin feared his son may have taken his own life. Here are the points left unresolved after the \u0026pound2.15million, 18-month probe. The Biffa lorry blunder  Corrie was seen on CCTV eating some takeaway food at 1.20am before falling asleep in a doorway for two hours. He then woke up and staggered 110 yards to the back of an industrial “horseshoe” area at 3.25am and was never seen again. It is believed he most likely crawled into a large recycling bin before being tragically crushed to death when a Biffa truck collected the cargo 50 minutes later and dropped the contents to a trading depot. Early on in the investigation, a false reading of the load of the bin was given. The contents were recorded as weighing 11kilos, or 1st 10lbs, when it was actually 116 kilos, or 15st 7lbs – a difference of nearly 14st. The false reading led police initially to discount the theory that Corrie was in the bin before the company came forward to correct the error. An independent report has agreed with Suffolk police’s conclusion that Corrie’s remains lie in the landfill site where the rubbish load on the Biffa lorry was taken. The landfill site  The independent report concluded Corrie’s remains lie in the 120-acre landfill site in Milton, Cambs – 30 miles from where Corrie was last seen. Detectives believe the most likely scenario is that the gunner, based at nearby RAF Honington, got into a recycling bin that was scooped up by a Biffa bin lorry from a horseshoe-shaped storage area and taken to the landfill site. Officers last year sifted through nearly 10,000 tonnes of rubbish in 27 weeks of searching at the site, but found no sign of his body. However, police yesterday made the astonishing admission that two separate searches they carried out there may have been in the wrong area of the site. Suffolk police said: “The records relied upon are not comprehensive and lack the detail required to identify precise search areas. Investigative enquiries identified the landfill site areas where Corrie was most likely to be. “This does not rule out the possibility of him being elsewhere within that site, or indeed at another landfill site. “The areas where Corrie could be now, are vast – many times bigger than the area of landfill already searched. “It would take years to complete. The environmental and legal impact of digging up such deep and wide areas of landfill is significant and prohibitive.” Did Corrie McKeague kill himself?      Corrie\u0027s dad Martin McKeague claimed the RAF man believed girlfriend April Oliver was \u0026shypregnant before he vanished. He feared this would have “a profound effect” on his son’s mental health. His dad couldn\u0027t rule out the possibility of suicide, saying in March: “I just can’t help thinking this would have weighed on him heavily and he may have actually chosen to get in that bin that night knowing what would happen. “It’s as probable as anything else and it makes it no less heartbreaking.” Private eye and the missing \u0026pound53,000  Campaigners blamed police for “lacking basic resources” to handle calls from the public. A JustGiving site set up by local campaigner Cheryl Hickman said: “The police investigation team, through a combination of lack of resources, intransigence and incompetence, have failed to capture and process vital evidence and still lack the basic resources to efficiently process a tiny number of phone calls per week.” Suffolk police categorically denied this but failed to correct continued public statements by campaigners that the police were struggling. More than 5,000 well-wishers raised \u0026pound53,000 – but so far no public accounts have been published, despite promises on the JustGiving site. The money was allegedly used to fund private investigators. But Suffolk police said the private probe created no new lines of enquiry. The private eyes provided a single disk of information relating to the FindCorrie Facebook page. Corrie’s dad Martin said: “I feel sorry for the well-wishers who donated their hard-earned money.” Campaigners’ posters gave five mobile phone numbers “answered by Corrie’s family and friends” instead of the official police hotline. Det Supt Elliott said: “Naturally we’d have wanted the information to come into the investigation team but it wasn’t within our remit to stipulate exactly how that should happen.” The Mirror has attempted to contact Ms Hickman for a comment. The deleted social media accounts including Grindr  Corrie was leading a double life, trawling the internet in search of casual sex with strangers. The 23-year-old gunner had an account on dating website Plenty of Fish. The serviceman described himself as “a princess” who was looking for a relationship. He also had an account on the gay dating app Grindr, set up when he was aged 21, two years before he disappeared. The account carried the username “BiLad21”. Corrie and his girlfriend April Oliver also joined an online swingers’ club. The airman created a profile on the Fab Swingers website in 2014, saying he was looking for straight and lesbian couples as well as for single women aged 18 to 60. It stated: “We are a young couple, but we know what we want.” Corrie’s family believe there could have been vital information in the social media accounts. However, they were deleted before the police were able to contact all relevant parties who may have come into contact with the serviceman. The Mirror can reveal “advice and assistance was offered to Corrie’s mother Nicola, above, around social media” from Suffolk police after it emerged she was responsible for deleting social media profiles.

Police have opened an investigation after the three people fell ill at a house in Skelmanthorpe, Huddersfield. Emergency services were called shortly after 7pm and a 40-year-old woman, 40, along with two boys aged 14 and 16, were found unresponsive at the scene. All three were taken to hospital where they continued to be treated today. Cops said they may have unknowingly come into contact with a potential illegal substance in the household. Neighbours said two teenage boys were unconscious in the driveway before police were called to the property.  The two boys looked like they had been beaten up as they lay slumped outside the three-bed semi-detached home on Sunday evening.

Then all this today comes out as if they had taken some type of drugs or substance. This is a nice area, but anything goes on nowadays.  The neighbour said the community had been left shocked following the heavy emergency service presence last night. One police car remains at the property with forensics combing the home for evidence. I just couldn\u0027t believe - you don\u0027t normally see six ambulance vehicles at one property, added the neighbour. Dean Jackson, 49, who lives on a street close by, said: I came past the house going home just as a paramedic car, a Skoda Octavia, put its lights on behind me.

In a scene familiar to thousands of parents who have taken their kids to the seaside over the heatwave, dozens of children frolic in the surf. Only two of them are identical twins, which should make them easy to spot. But in the chaos of ice creams, footballs, buckets and spades and starfish, it’s not as easy as it may seem at first glance.  The puzzle was concocted by parenting experts ChannelMum , whose spokesman, Siobhan Freegard, said: “Every parent will know what it’s like to look at a sea of other kids and wonder exactly where their child is.   “And for those with twins, it’s double trouble – which is exactly the case in this fiendish puzzle. “One clue we can offer is that although the twins are indeed identical, they don’t look exactly alike – you’ll see why when you spot them.” Answer below...

Young girls, for example, are often being told that they shouldn\u0027t play certain games, or should act more feminine - and many simply do as instructed. However one Girl Scout from a small town in Ohio refused to let a sexist comment slide. Julianne Speyer had been taking part in the Chesterland 4th of July parade with fellow Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. All had been going well until the person announcing the parade informed the crowd that the Boy Scouts were the future leaders of America and that the Girl Scouts were  just having fun.  The 12-year-old was really bothered by this comment, so she decided to take action and wrote a letter to the editor of her local paper, the Geauga Maple Leaf, to highlight the issue. Her letter, which has gone viral on social media, said: My name is Julianne Speyer. I am 12 years old and I would like to inform you of how offended and disappointed I am by the announcer of the Chesterland 4 July parade\u0027s comment about the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. Julianne wrote that she found the comment to be very sexist and patronising. She added: I would appreciate it if you would help me to let other people know how much this kind of thing happens and how bad it is.  I feel it is an insult to both girls and women of all ages. This kind of thing happens way too much and it is not OK at all. “I have always been taught that if you think something is unjust, change it. So this is how I am making a change. Thank you for listening to me and I hope you can help me.” People on Twitter went wild for her letter, with more than 17,000 people sharing it and 62,000 people liking it.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot. I’m pleased because I know how difficult it is going to Peterhead.

In some ways it felt like it was taking forever for us to get there. But she is a bit better now so we are really excited and hopeful.“She is still in a bit of pain but hopefully that is OK while we are in Germany.

It’s just been incredible how everyone rallied together to raise this amount of money so quickly.”The therapy at the clinic in the Black Forest offers immunotherapy, a new treatment that is said to have cured some cancer patients. The treatment uses the body’s own immune system to fight cancer by helping it to recognise and attack dangerous cells.Greg added: “I think the people of Dundee should be really proud of themselves.“It’s a testament to them and their generosity.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b5b449a1c82a.jpg ","title":"gulls mug pensioner for her tuna sandwich","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pensioner has spoken of her horror after she was “mugged” by a flock of gulls in the city centre.Patricia Simpson, 69, from Charleston, had been enjoying an afternoon of shopping with her daughter Hazel and grandchildren.The former chef described the incident as like something out of the Alfred Hitchcock horror film The Birds.Patricia was leaving the Overgate near Boots when as many as five gulls swooped on her to snatch her tuna sandwich.She said: “I thought I was being mugged.“One of the gulls drew blood from my right hand.“During the incident I actually thought someone was after my handbag.”Patricia added: “There was no warning – they literally came out of nowhere.“They were right in my face.

I’ve seen it myself.“They should be fined for deliberately dropping food or being spotted feeding them.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We know that gulls can often be a cause for considerable distress and annoyance and we continually pursue tried and tested as well as innovative solutions to the problems that arise from these birds.“We would also ask that people do not feed seagulls as this exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures dundee united take on 100 young arabs at open day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United players took on 100 young Arabs at Tannadice yesterday with many more fans getting a chance to meet the players.The Tangerines held their annual open day giving supporters the chance to meet the squad aiming to get their side back in to the Premiership."},{"url":null,"title":"ten minutes each game has cost us says dundee united boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo believes 10 minutes per game has been the difference between success and failure in Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign.That’s why the Tangerines are heading for Elgin on Saturday for what is a dead rubber.However, he’s seen enough from his team in the other 240 minutes of their group games to remain confident a successful league campaign lies ahead.“Unfortunately, a football match is 90 minutes. If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes. Paul is more of a winger and we cannot give him high balls and expect him to win headers.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"van driver was more than twice speed limit near dundee

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

community","story":"\u0026nbspTHE length of time being taken to start work on the fire-ravaged former Eastgate Hostel in Inverness city centre is \"unacceptable\", a senior Highland Council official has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact the owners have to make the right decision for their own interest but we have to make sure we represent the public interest and that it is protected as far as the law will allow us to do that.\"Agent for the site owners, Gary Johnston, said they would not comment at this time.The last public announcement made by two of them \u0026ndash Mr Ali and Mr Cheng \u0026ndash came in a statement last month where they claimed \"a new way forward\" was being investigated, but would not elaborate on what that entailed.No more details were forthcoming when the Courier contacted Mr Johnston more recently.Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It looks like the people of Inverness don\u0026rsquot care.\"Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice lies just beyond the former hostel in Stephens Brae, branded the ongoing situation \"a complete disgrace\", and repeated his previous calls for the council to compulsorily purchase the building.\"It has been \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo since day one,\" he said.\"Mr Haas has been trying to keep everyone happy and now no-one is happy.\"Mr Haas insisted a lot of work is continuing \"behind the scenes\", including council officers working with the owners to provide the appropriate information to enable planning officials to provide, in return, the right advice regarding the outstanding planning application.\"We need facts and once we have the facts we can move forward,\" he said.\"We absolutely have the public interest at heart.

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 1:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116840.jpg","title":"New team aims to make changes easier","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW team of health and social care professionals has been established to support disabled people transition from children to adult services.People aged between 14 and 25 were traditionally supported by Highland Council\u0027s children\u0027s services and NHS Highland\u0027s adult services.The new transitioning team will provide a consistent platform for young people, parents and carers at what can be a challenging time.Nicola Stewart, transitions team manager, said: \"The team has been set up in response to recognising that the transition period can be difficult for young people and their families and carers.\"There are a lot of changes in a young person\u0027s life during that period, such as leaving full-time education and starting employment, and we don\u0027t want the process of transitioning from one service to another to exacerbate that.\"The overarching vision for the team is to take young people living in the Inner Moray Firth area through the process of transition and to support them in a more consistent way than has been possible in the past.\"Transitions team manager Stella Chisholm said: \"The establishment of the team will provide the opportunity for the one service to support an individual from 14 years of age all the way through to 25.\"This is a fantastic example of joint working.

A new hotel will play a key role in supporting the local economy\u0027 continued growth.\"Construction work is set to be undertaken by international firm Polcom Developments.Managing director Ross Morrow said: \"The proposed hotel, which will be branded by a well-known international hotel chain, will provide accommodation, meeting and fitness facilities for airport users, overseas visitors and local businesses.\"Polcom Developments has extensive experience in developing airport hotels, having recently been involved in the construction of a 250-bedroom hotel at Luton Airport.\"The firm also recently completed a 160-bedroom Marriott hotel on the Heriot Watt University campus, just a few miles from Edinburgh Airport.A design and access statement submitted to council planners places the hotel within the context of a wider masterplan for the development of the business park which Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stewart Nicol previously said was \"more slow burn than anybody would want\".It had secured just two tenants between 2011 and last year, before the Co-op also confirmed construction of a new distribution facility there.The site planned for the hotel is currently unoccupied but was previously used for agricultural grazing.Said to be five minutes\u0026rsquo walk from the airport, a new access road will have to be created as part of any development.Inverness economist Tony Mackay previously queried the viability of a hotel at the airport after Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) tendered for a similar development at its Inverness Campus.This week he acknowledged that the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote was continuing to fuel a tourist boom in the Highlands.\"There have been plans for a hotel at Inverness airport for many years but none of them has gone ahead yet,\" he said.\"I think that most of the hotel operators prefer locations in or close to the city centre rather than out at the airport.\"However, it seems that IABP have now found a hotel operator willing to take the risk of the airport location.\"Inverness Airport has done very well in recent years and the hotel investment and jobs should be an excellent addition to the facilities there.\"Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister also welcomed the plans.\"I think it will be good for tourists and those from further north who need to catch a late or early flight,\" she said.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 1:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116838.jpg","title":"Positive buildings discussions","story":"\u0026nbspTALKS with Highland Council about possible changes to the regime of building inspections have been \"very positive\" an MSP has said.Labour Highland member David Stewart is pushing for a change in the law to require building owners to regularly survey their properties.He is being backed by former Inverness provost Jimmy Gray as both raised concerns after incidents across the city including masonry falling from a building in Church Street during strong winds and glass panels shattering above retail park walkways.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027s more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Cllr Gray added: \"It has been obvious to most people involved in building conservation and maintenance and also the wider public that the present legislation is completely inadequate and has created a situation whereby some of our buildings are in a dangerous condition, exposing the public to unacceptable risks.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun sweat and stunts at the mayds sports day","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/07/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) Sports Day Not on the Green kicked off on Friday June 29 to sun and sports.The sun didn’t deter the many athletes filling the fields at Lochgilphead joint campus, with rugby, football and golf just a few of the many activities enjoyed.The annual sporting event celebrated their anniversary 10 years of healthy attitude and fun with a portable skate park set up in the car park and even Wonder Woman stuntman, Dom Kinnaird, demonstrating moves for taking down bad guys.With the help of the Year of Young People National Lottery Fund, the event was organised by MAYDS themselves and featured music and stalls with temporary tattoos, face painting, hot dogs and ice cream, with swimming also held at the MACPool.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites.

At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And, of course, the youngsters enjoyed being pictured with Ayr’s own sporty star Michael, who brought along the League 1 trophy.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Lawyer Ian Gillies pleaded guilty on Cooper’s behalf to a break-in charge against her. He said he was unable to explain her absence from court. The charge admitted by the duo says they broke into the home of a man, then aged 66, in Prestwick’s Adamton Road South, on October 10 last year.  Graham admitted an additional charge of breaking into the home of a 93-old man in Ayr’s Elba Court, also on October 10 last year. This charge states that she stole around \u0026pound400 in cash from the man. The court heard that Graham, formerly of an address in Ayr’s Russell Drive, now lives in Prestwick. Coopers’ address was given as Murray Gardens in Maybole. The case was adjourned until August 16, when the pair are expected to appear together for sentence.

according to the Central Bank of Ireland, as it urged businesses to prepare for all scenarios.\nAccording to the bank\u0026rsquos third quarterly bulletin of 2018, published on Monday,\u0026nbsp the Irish economy is growing at a robust pace, with domestic demand expected to grow by 4.4% this year and 4.1% next year.\nHowever potential risks include potential trade war in the US and Britain\u0026rsquos exit from the European Union.\nMark Cassidy, the Bank\u0026rsquos director of economics and statistics welcomed the robust economic growth and employment but says external factors could create problems.\n\u0026ldquoThere are economic risks facing Ireland from several fronts that cannot be ignored.\n\u0026ldquoIt is clear that a \u0026lsquohard\u0026rsquo or disruptive Brexit remains a material risk, while the threat of potential trade wars and changes to international taxation have not abated.\nThe Irish border in the village of Bridgend, Co Donegal (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\u0026ldquoWe have put into the public domain what we think the impact of a hard Brexit with no trade deal at all would be, over the medium term, our estimate is that it would have a negative impact on output of 3.2% over 10 years, with around 40,000 fewer jobs over that same period.\n\u0026ldquoIf its a sudden Brexit, we will expect more of the effects in the first few years.\n\u0026ldquoWe need everyone in all parts of the economy to prepare for all scenarios in relation to Brexit.\nHe added that those hit most by Brexit will be firms reliant on exports to the UK, like the Agri-food sector.\nThe last quarter\u0026rsquos robust economy is supported by the strength of domestic activity and favourable international growth, however as the economy moves towards full capacity, the bank say there is a risk that continued expansion could give rise to overheating pressures.\nThe unemployment rate is forecast to average 5.4% in 2018, revised down from 5.6% in the April bulletin, and 4.8% next year.\nAs unemployment has come down quicker than expected, and the outlook is strong for the next two years, the bank say there is scope for more ambitious fiscal targets.\nMr Cassidy added: \u0026ldquoNewer targets would increase financial buffers and help avoid a situation where government policy itself would contribute to overheating pressures within the economy which could damage economic competitiveness.\nInflation is expected to remain moderate at 0.7% this year and 0.8% next year.\n\u0026ldquoThe continued growth in the economy, which is broadly balanced between domestic and export activity, is to be welcomed, Mr Cassidy said.\n\u0026ldquoSo too is the projected growth in employment, with our economy due to benefit from an additional 100,000 net new jobs by the end of 2019.\n\u0026ldquoDomestically, the strength of economic growth means our economy risks hitting full capacity, which gives rise to the risk of overheating or boom-bust cycles.\n\u0026ldquoThis underscores the importance of building fiscal buffers during the good times.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

to greater creativity and can spark original ideas, experts say.\nThe research, by an international team of psychologists, suggests the most creative people are those who are open to change and challenging themselves.\nIt also found such openness to new experiences can be fostered in everyone, helping to generate greater creative thinking across societies.\nIn the work, published in the Journal of Personality, researchers tested people\u0026rsquos predisposition for divergent thinking \u0026ndash the ability to generate new ideas that go beyond current thinking.\nAcross three studies, 798 participants completed a divergent thinking test where they were asked to generate as many different uses for a brick as possible in three minutes.\nA brick challenge was put to volunteers (PA)\nThese answers were then scored according to their fluency, flexibility and originality.\nIn the first two studies, the most creative participants were also open to new experiences and had high scores on a personality trait called \u0026ldquonovelty seeking.\nThe researchers asked whether novelty seeking, and therefore creativity, could be increased in everyone regardless of personality in the third study.\nParticipants were asked to consider how new experiences could benefit them, others were asked to perform a gap-filling exercise or do nothing at all.\nResults showed divergent thinking increased in the participants who considered the benefits of new experiences, meaning that novelty seeking can be temporarily increased.\nDr Gosia Goclowska, from the University of Bath\u0026rsquos Department of Psychology, said: \u0026ldquoOur study suggests that using the right set of instructions, one that encourages people to embrace novelty and challenge, can lead to increased creativity in nearly everyone.\n\u0026ldquoCreativity is not limited to geniuses or prodigies. In the right circumstances and with the right mindset most people can be very creative regardless of what personality they have.\n\u0026ldquoOne way to do this is to cultivate a greater openness towards novelty \u0026ndash for instance by thinking of the benefits that novelty can bring to our life.\nHowever, Dr Goclowska said the application of the research depends for individuals, and what they might need in certain situations.\nOpening up to new experiences can be useful for people who want to generate new ideas but others may already have lots of ideas and need to focus on implementing them.\nPeople could also find opening up to novelty makes their lives more stressful and undermines performance, if they already have too much going on.\nDr Goclowska said some circumstances, such as having to move to a different city or country or learn a new skill, could not be avoided.\n\u0026ldquoIn those circumstances seeking support from others and taking care of our psychological health can increase our ability to cope with change, and can help cultivate a greater openness, she said.\n\u0026ldquoIn those instances, if we succeed at being open and positive about new experiences, they are likely to be a win-win when it comes to creativity.\nThe study, \u0026ldquoNovelty seeking is linked to openness and extraversion, and can lead to greater creative performance, is published in the Journal of Personality.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

They really enhance the town and let visitors see it at its best.Regrettably, others have been doing their utmost to show the town at its worst.Most evenings boy and girl racers are out speeding along Hall Street, their modified exhausts making as much racket as a Formula One racing car.They revv them up to make as much noise as possible as they accelerate then make a great din of banging and popping as they slow down.Parked at the ferry terminal, they think it\u0026#8217s smart to sound their horns constantly at each other and at other cars passing by.The folk in Pensioners Row, or in the nursing home, or Harbour View, must be driven demented by them, and I wouldn\u0026#8217t like to have paid more than £100 for a sea view room at the Royal to have that noise going on under my window.There are groups that sit in the evenings at the picnic benches along the prom, drinking publicly in contravention of the by-laws, passing interesting smoking materials from hand to hand and shouting at the tops of their voices, probably to make themselves heard above the music being played at full volume on their mobile phones.Their language would make a trooper blush.On Saturday evening last, some of them thought it would be a good idea to take the wheely bins that are placed along the prom and toss them into the sea, but not until they\u0026#8217d strewn half the contents \u0026#8211 food containers, empty bottles and bags of dog dirt   \u0026#8211 along the path.They smashed Buckfast bottles around the Jock\u0026#8217s Boat play area.Campbeltown at its best, and Campbeltown at its worst.Name and Address Supplied.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter the economics of dignity","story":"Auchinlee was a registered care home for 24 older people with dementia inspected by the Scottish Care Inspectorate to their standards (including staffing requirements).I understand that some of these residents were accommodated at Lorne Campbell Court when Auchinlee closed.Their re-assessments were made at the time the Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) were looking for £14 million cuts as highlighted on the Courier\u0026#8217s front page on March 9.I was incensed to read the HSCP communications manager’s letter clarifying that Lorne Campbell Court \u0026#8216Does not provide dementia care but it does provide an extra care housing service for individuals who are living independently but who require additional care and support, especially overnight.\u0026#8217 It is rubbing salt in the wound.Could his interest in semantics, pedantic attention to detail and requirement to correct the Courier be more to do with the re-definition of need to suit budgetary requirements and reduced scrutiny?Woe betide the HSCP if this new service is categorised as a residential home and the regulators come knocking at the door with their inspection criteria?Whilst there are different types, dementia is a progressive disease and as time goes by, sufferers require more help rather than less.I consider any reduction in care for these vulnerable individuals is irresponsible.I have the greatest respect for the extreme hard work of all the community staff working under very difficult circumstances, having been one myself, and I am not criticising Lorne Campbell Court.I am saddened at the ever diminishing resources available.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

León, as well as more modern performances featuring lasers and pyrotechnics.While some younger children weren\u0026#8217t too keen on the clowns, who interacted with the audience throughout much of the performance, others found them the most amusing, their slapstick capers eliciting some of the biggest laughs.The most heart-stopping moments came from aerial artiste, Alexandra, whose skills on an elevated hoop were astounding, and one of the Jackson Family, who balanced precariously atop a ladder.Other tense moments came from an entertainer who spun various items at the same time with her hands and feet, including a pole that was on fire at either end, the audience waiting to see if it would plummet into the stands.Even the more basic stunts, like juggling, had an added element of tension, with the objects, resembling yo-yos, launched many feet into the air by a rope.The animal-free circus continued its UK tour, leaving Campbeltown on Thursday morning heading for Arran, before

too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

Her dad Stan mounted the first major expedition to the caves, in the Andes Mountains in the east of the country, alongside astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1976.  Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Eileen, who was born in the country\u0026rsquos capital Quito, moved to Dunbar in 1997, with mum Janeth working in Cherrytrees Nursery.  A small display of Ecuadorian items has been created in BeGreen Dunbar\u0026rsquos shop window on High Street as part of the donation campaign to fund the trip.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

Weather forecasters have warned that the mercury is likely to hit 30C (86F) across the south of England by Friday, instead of being concentrated in the south east.  The thermometer will carry on climbing over the weekend reaching highs of 32C (89.6F)and possibly 33C (91.4F).  While the south shrivels, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.  A spokeswoman for the Met Office said: \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIn terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures haven\u0026rsquot reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so it\u0026rsquos already starting to warm up again.  \u0026ldquoOver the next few days there will be something of a north and south split \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather.  She warned: \u0026ldquoSouthern England and Wales are going to turn quite hot by Friday \u0026ndash temperatures will probably reach 30C (86F) by that point.  \u0026ldquoThis is likely to include quite a wide area across the southern part of the UK \u0026ndash it will widely hit 30C (86F) across southern England and Wales, and the very hot weather will return as we approach the weekend.  The north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect outbreaks of much-needed rain on Tuesday, Wednesday and in to Thursday.  The spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a more varied picture across the north but it\u0026rsquos an improving situation \u0026ndash sunshine with some showers and a similar story across the weekend.  \u0026ldquoBy Friday the temperatures could get into the mid 20s, so warming up, just not as hot as it is in the south.  The weather broke on Friday, treating the parched landscape to a deluge of rain.  It meant this July will be wetter than the blistering heatwave of July 1976.  An average 49.9mm of rain fell across the UK from July 1 to July 29, according to provisional figures from the Met Office, and with further rain expected this week, the final total could be higher.  The total for the whole of July 1976 was 43.3mm.  The UK suffered a long heatwave during the summer of 1976, which helped make July 1976 the joint ninth driest on record.  Currently, July this year is the 13th driest on record, the Met Office said.  The driest ever July was in 1955, when an average of 30.6mm rainfall was measured across the UK.  Comparable records for rainfall date back to 1910."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8139630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"central-bank-of-ireland-tells-businesses-to-prepare-for-all-brexit-scenarios","story":"  According to the bank\u0026rsquos third quarterly bulletin of 2018, published on Monday,\u0026nbsp the Irish economy is growing at a robust pace, with domestic demand expected to grow by 4.4% this year and 4.1% next year.  However potential risks include potential trade war in the US and Britain\u0026rsquos exit from the European Union.  Mark Cassidy, the Bank\u0026rsquos director of economics and statistics welcomed the robust economic growth and employment but says external factors could create problems.  \u0026ldquoThere are economic risks facing Ireland from several fronts that cannot be ignored.  \u0026ldquoIt is clear that a \u0026lsquohard\u0026rsquo or disruptive Brexit remains a material risk, while the threat of potential trade wars and changes to international taxation have not abated.  \u0026ldquoWe have put into the public domain what we think the impact of a hard Brexit with no trade deal at all would be, over the medium term, our estimate is that it would have a negative impact on output of 3.2% over 10 years, with around 40,000 fewer jobs over that same period.  \u0026ldquoIf its a sudden Brexit, we will expect more of the effects in the first few years.  \u0026ldquoWe need everyone in all parts of the economy to prepare for all scenarios in relation to Brexit.  He added that those hit most by Brexit will be firms reliant on exports to the UK, like the Agri-food sector.  The last quarter\u0026rsquos robust economy is supported by the strength of domestic activity and favourable international growth, however as the economy moves towards full capacity, the bank say there is a risk that continued expansion could give rise to overheating pressures.  The unemployment rate is forecast to average 5.4% in 2018, revised down from 5.6% in the April bulletin, and 4.8% next year.  As unemployment has come down quicker than expected, and the outlook is strong for the next two years, the bank say there is scope for more ambitious fiscal targets.  Mr Cassidy added: \u0026ldquoNewer targets would increase financial buffers and help avoid a situation where government policy itself would contribute to overheating pressures within the economy which could damage economic competitiveness.  Inflation is expected to remain moderate at 0.7% this year and 0.8% next year.  \u0026ldquoThe continued growth in the economy, which is broadly balanced between domestic and export activity, is to be welcomed, Mr Cassidy said.  \u0026ldquoSo too is the projected growth in employment, with our economy due to benefit from an additional 100,000 net new jobs by the end of 2019.  \u0026ldquoDomestically, the strength of economic growth means our economy risks hitting full capacity, which gives rise to the risk of overheating or boom-bust cycles.  \u0026ldquoThis underscores the importance of building fiscal buffers during the good times."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8139631.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"opening-up-to-new-experience-can-lead-to-light-bulb-moments-study","story":"  The research, by an international team of psychologists, suggests the most creative people are those who are open to change and challenging themselves.  It also found such openness to new experiences can be fostered in everyone, helping to generate greater creative thinking across societies.  In the work, published in the Journal of Personality, researchers tested people\u0026rsquos predisposition for divergent thinking \u0026ndash the ability to generate new ideas that go beyond current thinking.  Across three studies, 798 participants completed a divergent thinking test where they were asked to generate as many different uses for a brick as possible in three minutes.  These answers were then scored according to their fluency, flexibility and originality.  In the first two studies, the most creative participants were also open to new experiences and had high scores on a personality trait called \u0026ldquonovelty seeking.  The researchers asked whether novelty seeking, and therefore creativity, could be increased in everyone regardless of personality in the third study.  Participants were asked to consider how new experiences could benefit them, others were asked to perform a gap-filling exercise or do nothing at all.  Results showed divergent thinking increased in the participants who considered the benefits of new experiences, meaning that novelty seeking can be temporarily increased.  Dr Gosia Goclowska, from the University of Bath\u0026rsquos Department of Psychology, said: \u0026ldquoOur study suggests that using the right set of instructions, one that encourages people to embrace novelty and challenge, can lead to increased creativity in nearly everyone.  \u0026ldquoCreativity is not limited to geniuses or prodigies. In the right circumstances and with the right mindset most people can be very creative regardless of what personality they have.  \u0026ldquoOne way to do this is to cultivate a greater openness towards novelty \u0026ndash for instance by thinking of the benefits that novelty can bring to our life.  However, Dr Goclowska said the application of the research depends for individuals, and what they might need in certain situations.  Opening up to new experiences can be useful for people who want to generate new ideas but others may already have lots of ideas and need to focus on implementing them.  People could also find opening up to novelty makes their lives more stressful and undermines performance, if they already have too much going on.  Dr Goclowska said some circumstances, such as having to move to a different city or country or learn a new skill, could not be avoided.  \u0026ldquoIn those circumstances seeking support from others and taking care of our psychological health can increase our ability to cope with change, and can help cultivate a greater openness, she said.  \u0026ldquoIn those instances, if we succeed at being open and positive about new experiences, they are likely to be a win-win when it comes to creativity.  The study, \u0026ldquoNovelty seeking is linked to openness and extraversion, and can lead to greater creative performance, is published in the Journal of Personality."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7515319.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-the-papers-say-july-31","story":"  Several front pages also feature images of Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham after the couple won ITV\u0026rsquos Love Island.

It comes as farmers were also due to meet with Government officials for a \"drought summit\" to discuss the effect on the country\u0027s food supplies of the extensive heatwave that has scorched the UK.  The first half of the summer in the UK has been the driest since 1961 with Thursday and Friday\u0027s wet weather and storms the first rainfall in weeks.  Mr Gove said that firms \"have much more to do to tackle leakage\", adding: \"That is why I have repeatedly made clear that companies must improve and recently wrote to them to outline my expectations during this period of dry weather.  \"Next week I will ask the chief executives of the water companies that have failed to meet their leakage targets to a meeting at Defra to discuss how they are going to address this serious issue and improve their performance.\"  United Utilities has previously been accused of \"wasting\" 430 million litres of water every day from leakages.  The GMB union said earlier this month that its research showed that United Utilities was allowing 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u0027 worth of water to go \"down the plughole\" every day.  The company said at the time that \"reducing leaks is a top priority\".  Irrigation water shortages, a lack of fresh forage for animals and growing conditions for cereal crops are among issues that will be discussed at separate talks chaired by National Farmers\u0027 Union president Minette Batters.  She will sit down on Wednesday with officials from Defra and a wide array of rural agencies, plus figures from farming charities after a July that has seen England receive just 15% of its long-term average rainfall.  Ms Batters described the situation as \"hugely challenging\" for all sectors of farming, warning that the thunderstorms and showers some areas are receiving \"won\u0027t mitigate the many issues farmers are experiencing\".  She said: \"There could be serious concerns for many farmers if this extended spell of warmer, drier weather continues as the long-range forecast suggests.\"  Those due to attend the summit alongside Defra include the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and farming charities RABI and Farming Community Network, the NFU said.  Last week the Environment Agency said it had responded to 44 \"significant\" environmental incidents since the end of June, including moorland fires, algal blooms, dry boreholes, low river flows and fish rescues as the hot, dry weather continues to grip.  The last month of dry, hot weather followed the driest June since 1925, the Environment Agency said. It has seen the water level in many reservoirs fall dramatically.  While only one water company is currently planning a hosepipe ban, continued dry weather into the autumn could see a risk of further restrictions and impacts on the environment, the National Drought Group said.  Ms Batters added: \"This unprecedented spell of weather really should be a wake-up call for us all. It\u0027s a timely reminder that we shouldn\u0027t take food production for granted.  \"Farming is one of the most affected industries when it comes to managing volatility.\""},{"url":null,"title":"think-tank-in-windrush-call-on-post-brexit-id-system","story":"  Extending the documentation programme for the 3.6 million Europeans living here to everyone else is among a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system recommended in a new report to strengthen the UK border.  Britain leaving the EU is the perfect time to come up with new ways of controlling national borders, the paper published on Monday by Policy Exchange suggests.  The idea of a national ID system for British citizens has been controversial for some time, with many people opposing it on civil liberties grounds.  A \u0026pound5 billion national identity card scheme was introduced by the last Labour government in 2006 but a Bill to scrap it was the first legislation introduced by Theresa May when she became home secretary in 2010.  EU citizens already in the UK will have to pay \u0026pound65 and join a registration scheme if they wish to stay in Britain after the end of the transition period on December 31 2020 under changes announced by the current Home Secretary Sajid Javid.  In the report, David Goodhart, Policy Exchange\u0027s head of demography, immigration and integration, suggests that the scheme should be widened to Britons, initially on a voluntary basis.  He said: \"We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are.  \"A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims.\"  Among the other ideas in The Border Audit: A Post-Windrush Review, are:  - A more decisive removals process, that gets people out before they can judicially review their cases, plus reforms to allow applications for asylum from outside the UK and private sponsorship of them.  - An amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for 10 years or more  - More cash to pay illegal immigrants to leave and a joint scheme involving the Department for International Development to help them set up businesses in their countries of origin  - A British version of the US Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) that allows non-UK citizens to use e-gates at borders and made it quicker for \"low-risk groups\" to enter  - One single \"command\" responsible for sea borders, under one person based in Portsmouth  - Make rail and ferry operators provide more information about passengers and introduce more collaboration with Irish authorities to close down the Common Travel Area \"backdoor\"  - Reduce citizenship application fees from \u0026pound1,500 per person and almost \u0026pound5,000 for a family with two children to a level \"more closely aligned to public policy, not just revenue needs\"  - Higher overall investment, including better detection systems for lorries at Calais and Dover, more staff and more border patrol boats  Mr Goodhart added: \"Illegal immigration is not only unfair on legal immigrants who wait their turn in the queue and the employers and businesses who play (and pay) by the rules, it also fosters a twilight world of criminality, dependence and exploitation in which modern slavery flourishes.  \"While a general amnesty for the estimated 500,000 illegal residents here would send the wrong signal, some form of regularisation should also be considered for those who have been here for more than 10 years, who are now parts of their communities with ties to the UK and often become the focus of grassroots campaigns.\"  A Home Office spokesman said: \"We are pursuing an ambitious programme of reform at the border as well as investing in new capability to improve passenger experience.  \"Examples of this include e-Passport gates and motion detection technology which benefit passengers and improve security.  \"Border Force invested \u0026pound63.5 million in new technology and capability in 2017-18 and \u0026pound90.4 million in the two previous years combined.  \"Decisions on the future immigration system will be based on evidence.  \"This is why we have asked the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the economic and social impacts of the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and also on how the UK\u0027s immigration system should be aligned with a modern industrial strategy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"close-call-predicted-but-interest-rates-expected-to-rise","story":"  In what would mark another milestone for the economy in its recovery since the financial crisis, members of nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) are expected to increase rates from 0.5% to 0.75% on Thursday.  The move would see rates hit their highest level since March 2009, when they were slashed from 1% to 0.5% as the financial meltdown and recession wrought havoc.  Investec economist George Brown said he is \"fairly confident\" the Bank will move to raise rates and is pencilling in an 8-1 vote in favour, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only dissenter.  He believes the economy has performed in line with the Bank\u0027s last forecasts in May, when it backed off from a widely anticipated hike and said it wanted to wait and see how the economy recovered after a weather-hit start to the year.  The bank also edged a step closer to pressing the button in June when its chief economist Andy Haldane joined two fellow policymakers in calling for a rise.  Howard Young at the EY Item Club believes the vote may be less definitive, given that inflation figures recently came in lower than expected - unchanged at 2.4% in June, while wage growth has also been weak.  He said: \"It has recently become a closer call, but we believe that the odds still favour the Bank of England lifting interest rate from 0.50% to 0.75% on Thursday after the August MPC meeting - most likely following a split vote.\"  He added: \"With interest rates down at 0.50%, the Bank of England would clearly likely to gradually normalise monetary policy given that it is essentially an emergency low rate.  \"Furthermore, inflation remains above target and the labour market looks relatively tight with the MPC considering that there is little slack left in the economy.\"  The decision to raise rates would come as a blow to some borrowers on variable rate mortgages, but would offer relief to savers who have seen paltry returns on deposits since rates have languished at 0.5% or below since 2009.  It is thought the bank\u0027s latest set of forecasts in the accompanying inflation report will reinforce the case for a rise, with many economists expecting growth to have recovered to 0.4% in the second quarter after slowing to 0.2% in the previous three months.  The bank had already predicted in May that this would be the case and its latest set of forecasts are set to confirm its outlook for the year ahead.  But the bank is likely to increase its inflation forecasts, with a weaker pound and higher oil and energy prices pushing up the outlook and further justifying the need for a rise.  A rate rise in August would be the second hike in the past year, after the Bank voted for an increase from 0.25% to 0.5% in November - the first such move for more than 10 years and reversing the cut made in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  Mr Brown believes this will be the only increase in 2018, however, predicting a quarter point rise every six months until they reach 1.5% in 2020.  \"We think the bank wants to raise rates in a gradual way and that would be consistent with the next one in February,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"britains-longest-running-childrens-comic-the-beano-celebrates-its-80th-birthday","story":"  And although Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx still look as youthful as ever as you flick through the pages, the comic is celebrating its 80th birthday.  A series of events have been staged to mark the landmark anniversary and the comic\u0026rsquos editorial director has pledged it will continue to laugh at the world \u0026ldquovia a kid\u0026rsquos-eye view in the years ahead.  Created by DC Thomson in Dundee, the Beano hit stands on July 30, 1938 as a companion paper to The Dandy, which went on sale eight months earlier.  In an age free of modern technology, it built a loyal following, going on to sell almost two million copies weekly in the 1950s.  With a copy of the comic sold every 17 seconds in the UK now, it continues to endear itself to youngsters today as parents introduce their children to the characters they loved when they were young.  In Dundee, the McManus museum has been renamed McMenace for an exhibition on the comic, including original artwork, a first edition of the Beano, fan club memorabilia and a history of publishers DC Thomson, with visitors encouraged to dress up as their favourite characters.  Actor and children\u0026rsquos author David Walliams has guest edited a commemorative issue also marking the anniversary.  In his editor\u0026rsquos letter, Walliams said: \u0026ldquoWhat I always loved about the Beano was that it felt naughty. It was a comic that you should read under the duvet with a torchlight. I don\u0026rsquot think I\u0026rsquod have got into writing my books without Beano.  \u0026ldquoWhen coming up with characters for my TV shows and books, I\u0026rsquod imagine them all as larger than life characters, much like the ones in Beano. The comic is quintessentially British and as long as there are children who like to laugh there will always be a place for the Beano.  Most of the Beano\u0026rsquos best-known characters were introduced to the pages of the Beano in the years after its launch, with the first edition fronted by Big Eggo The Ostrich who kept his place there for a decade before being ousted by Biffo the Bear.  Very few first issues of the Beano remain in existence, with one selling for more than \u0026pound17,000 at auction in 2015. Dennis the Menace is the longest-running character to appear in the comic. He made his Beano debut on March 17, 1951, but the \u0026ldquoWorld\u0026rsquos Wildest Boy had to wait until May 5 of that year to be given his trademark black-and-red stripped jumper.  Beano has also diversified to target a new online audience, launching Beano in 2016, which has been visited by 2.5million children. Meanwhile, 1.86 million copies of Beano were sold in 2017, with latest figures showing a 7.9% year-on-year increase in sales, recording weekly sales figures of 37,542 copies.  To further mark the special birthday, Beano have relaunched the infamous Fan Club, offering free membership and printable club badges and certificates.  Mike Stirling, editorial director of Beano Studios, said: \u0026ldquoEverything about Beano has always evolved naturally, inspired by the kids we speak and listen to, every single day.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove ensured the situations our characters find themselves in are always relatable to every generation. It\u0026rsquos all underpinned by our philosophy of laughing at the world via a kid\u0026rsquos-eye view.  \u0026ldquoOur online hub, Beano - the fastest growing kids\u0026rsquo website in the UK - and No 1 smash-hit Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed animation series now mean more kids than ever before are enjoying Beano-inspired everyday rebellion."},{"url":null,"title":"britain-faces-green-transport-revolution-as-uk-ministers-consider-electric-delivery-vehicles-for-cities","story":"  Britain is facing a green \u0026ldquotransport revolution with the government determined to find ways of reducing congestion and cutting pollution.

The Department for Transport suggested travel around the UK could dramatically change with the \u0026ldquointroduction of flying vehicles or widespread use of self-driving cars, all while travel data would help to deliver better journeys.  It noted that the potential increased use of self-driving vehicles and shared travel could also transform how city centres look in years to come. For example, the majority of parking spaces could be removed, opening areas up for redevelopment and potentially hundreds of thousands of new urban homes.  The Government documents fire the starting gun on its Future of Mobility Grand Challenge, which aims to make the UK the world leader in the movement of goods, services and people.  The work is all part of the Conservative administration\u0026rsquos Industrial Strategy and, said the Department, it could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make travel safer, improve accessibility, and present enormous economic opportunities for the UK.  As part of this, the Government today also confirmed more than \u0026pound12m for six projects working on simulation and modelling to aid the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. The capability, it explained, would be essential for developing, testing and proving the safety of the vehicles.  Jesse Norman, the Transport Minister, said: \u0026ldquoThe UK has a long and proud history of leading the world in transport innovation and our Future of Mobility Grand Challenge is designed to ensure this continues.  \u0026ldquoWe are on the cusp of an exciting and profound change in how people, goods and services move around the country which is set to be driven by extraordinary innovation.  \u0026ldquoThis could bring significant benefits to people right across the country and presents enormous economic opportunities for the UK, with autonomous vehicles sales set to be worth up to \u0026pound52 billion by 2035.  \u0026ldquoThis call for evidence marks just one stage in our push to make the most of these inviting opportunities, he added.  Today\u0026rsquos publication precedes a full Future of Urban Mobility Strategy, which is due to be published by the end of the year.  It coincides with the announced of the appointment of Ian Robertson, the Chief Executive of BMW UK, as Business Champion to help advise, shape and develop the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge.  He said: \u0026ldquoA transport revolution in the way people and goods move around will see more changes in the next ten years than the previous hundred.  \u0026ldquoAs the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge Business Champion, I\u0026rsquom looking forward to working with the Government to help the UK build on its existing strengths and capitalise on that opportunity.  The Department pointed out how changes in society had already changed the way people were travelling such as people driving less overall, fewer workers commuting, a growing elderly population and the number of people living in urban areas increasing.  As a result, the Government has used its call for evidence to outline trends which could shape the future of transport in the UK. These include:  *Cleaner transport. The Government has already outlined its intention for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040. Falling battery prices, improvements in electric vehicle technology and the development of alternative fuels are not only reducing emissions from existing modes of transport but paving the way for the uptake of new creations.  *Automation. Improved sensors, increased computing power and the exciting potential of artificial intelligence are leading to increased automation in transport. The Government has already said it expected to see fully self-driving cars on UK roads by 2021 and the benefits of automated transport could include increased safety, improved accessibility and better use of urban space.  *Data and connectivity. Internet-connected vehicles can not only link with each other, helping to avert congestion on roads but also traffic lights and motorway signs. This could not only reduce traffic but also improve air quality.  *New modes. UK cities are already pioneering the use of drones to support emergency services and improve infrastructure inspections. But the introduction of aerial passenger vehicles could also appear in urban areas, while the lines between taxis and buses could blur, with more on demand transport.  *Shared mobility. More use of shared transport could reduce congestion and emissions and examples are likely to include commercial ride sharing, car rental services where users rent from one another and shared use bikes.  *Changing consumer attitudes. Technology is also changing the way people expect to be able to travel with more users expecting to be able to plan, book and pay for transport through their phones.  *New business models. New business models are beginning to emerge, such as Mobility as a Service. Maas can make payment easier, provide better real-time information and allow passengers to book multiple modes of transport with just one click."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-told-by-italys-matteo-salvini-to-be-tough-with-brussels-or-face-being-swindled","story":"  Right-wing populist Matteo Salvini insisted the Prime Minister should be prepared to walk away without a deal, saying: \"On some principles there is no need to be flexible and you should not go backwards.\"  Mr Salvini, a former MEP who has clashed with the EU since entering government earlier this year, spoke as Mrs May faced pressure from senior Conservative Party figures not to cede any more ground to Brussels.  Her Chequers Plan sparked the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary and David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and while party figures have supported it, some have warned it should be a line in the sand rather than a flexible starting point for negotiations.  Mr Salvini, leader of hardline anti-immigrant party the League, said there was \"no objectivity or good faith from the European side\", adding: \"My experience in the European Parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you.\"  His hardline comments to The Sunday Times came after the PM and senior ministers embarked on a series of visits to EU27 countries in an attempt to get backing for her Chequers Plan.  On Thursday, the Brexit blueprint was dealt a severe blow by Brussels when Michel Barnier, its chief negotiator, rejected the customs proposals that form a key plank of the UK Government\u0026rsquos White Paper.  On Friday, Mrs May received a welcome boost after Austria agreed that Brexit would be among topics for discussion at a forthcoming informal meeting of EU leaders.  Downing Street said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed that Britain\u0027s departure from the EU would be on the agenda for the European Council being hosted by his country - which currently holds the EU presidency - on September 20.  It means the PM has an extra gathering of leaders to try to convince them to support her Brexit plan after a week in which ministers have been deployed to various capitals to woo senior politicians.  The next meeting is a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels in October, by which time it is hoped a Brexit deal will have been hammered out.  Meanwhile, Mrs May has been backed by her local Conservative Association chairman.  Richard Kellaway said the Maidenhead branch \"fully supported\" her plan and he had been impressed by a briefing on it for association heads in Downing Street.  \"Most of us found it quite persuasive and convincing. We have received little criticism from our members. I\u0027m of the group of people who feel that it is not a great deal but it is not bad. We have to actually have a deal,\" he added.  However, Mr Kellaway was earlier quoted by The Sunday  as warning: \u0026ldquoIf it were to be diluted it would ultimately not be acceptable.  Elsewhere, Lawyers for Britain said that the Chequers Plan would mean UK courts would continue to be ruled by the EU.  Its Chairman, Martin Rowe, accused the PM of a \u0026ldquowholesale abandonment of her promises made in the Tory manifesto and in her Lancaster House speech.  \u0026ldquoWithin the common rulebook areas at least, it is quite clear that the interpretation of the laws applying within the UK will continue to be carried out by judges in Luxembourg with judges in the UK having only a subservient role, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-russell-signals-scots-government-considering-stockpiling-medicines-in-event-of-no-deal-brexit","story":"  The UK Government has already made clear that it is making contingency plans to maintain supplies of food and medicine in the event of a no-deal, stressing how the public should be comforted and reassured that it is doing so.

Sir Michael pointed out how, in terms of insulin: \"We import every drop of it.\"  It is believed that insulin is among the medicines the UK Government is now considering stockpiling.

Passengers had suffered the worst disruption on the network since services began in September 2014, the National Audit Office (NAO) reported.  A long-running dispute over driver-only trains between Southern and unions saw commuters in the South East of England endure years of misery with repeated strikes and disrupted services.  The NAO found that, while industrial action was a \u0026ldquomajor contributor to delays and cancellations, the Department for Transport (DfT) made decisions which \u0026ldquohave negatively impacted on passengers.  Govia Thameslink Railway was also hit by the overhaul of timetables in May.  -Fares  Mr Grayling was criticised for taking a trip to Qatar when the biggest rail fare rises for five years were announced in January.  He insisted he had not \u0026ldquoshirked the issuebut admitted they were \u0026ldquohigher than I would wish.  Labour said his travel abroad \u0026ldquosmacked of a man running scared as the cost of train tickets rose by an average of 3.4%.  \u0026ndash East Coast Main Line franchise  The line between London and Edinburgh was brought back under public control in May after an agreement with Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) ended five years early.  Mr Grayling said the parent companies of VTEC \u0026ndash Stagecoach and Virgin \u0026ndash had \u0026ldquogot their bid wrong in terms of the revenue from the franchise, which was originally due to run until 2023.  Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Mr Grayling had \u0026ldquogifted Stagecoach and Virgin, who took over in 2015, a \u0026ldquo\u0026pound2 billion bailout after they failed on the major route.  \u0026ndash Northern Rail  Mr Grayling faced a vote of no confidence \u0026ndash but survived \u0026ndash in the wake of Northern\u0026rsquos chaotic timetable collapse in June.  He had rejected calls for Northern to be renationalised, although he accepted the situation experienced by passengers was \u0026ldquounacceptable.  In a later appearance before the Commons Transport Select Committee, he raised eyebrows by insisting: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot run the railways.  he Transport Secretary told MPs he is \u0026ldquonot a specialist in rail matters and it would have been \u0026ldquoirresponsible for him to halt the introduction of new timetables.  He blamed Network Rail, the state-owned company responsible for Britain\u0026rsquos rail infrastructure, as the major source of the delays and cancellations experienced by people using the services.  \u0026ndash Airport expansion  Opponents of the Government\u0026rsquos backing of a third runway at Heathrow have been critical of the DfT\u0026rsquos handling of the long-running process that resulted in the west London airport being picked over contenders.

The Scottish Government has also indicated it is considering contingency plans should Britain face a cliff-edge Brexit.  However, Brexiteers have criticised the approach, insisting that, while preparations must be made to show Brussels that the UK could cope without a deal, the plans should not mark a return to the referendum campaign\u0027s \"Project Fear\".

She was reacting to the fallout from remarks by former Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson, who said unionists should prepare for what would happen if they were to lose a future border poll.  Mr Robinson\u0027s party colleague Sammy Wilson was among a number of unionists to criticise the former first minister\u0027s comments, accusing him of giving encouragement to the republican narrative.  Mrs McDonald said it was \"common sense\" to look at possible constitutional changes, even if you did not support them.

The report says devolution has \u0026ldquoarguably qualified Westminster\u0026rsquos sovereignty and changed the balance of powers across the UK.  But it notes: \u0026ldquoWhitehall still operates extensively on the basis of a structure and culture which take little account of the realities of devolution in the UK. This is inimical to the principles of devolution and good governance in the UK.  ANALYSIS:\u0026nbspYou\u0026rsquoll have had your devolution. Supreme Court hears that power devolved is power retained  It says it was \u0026ldquohighly regrettable that there was little consultation with the devolved governments over the EU Withdrawal Bill as more liaison could have avoided much of the acrimony that was generated.  In future, the committee suggests, draft legislation should be shared with the devolved governments to identify and work through issues in advance.  In recognition of the significance of devolution to the UK\u0026rsquos constitutional arrangements, MPs call on the UK Government to establish a \u0026ldquoDevolution Policy for the Union, including giving more consideration to England.  In a key section, the report says it is important Theresa May and her colleagues recognise the reserved powers model of devolution means \u0026ldquopowers are devolved by default and not conferred by the UK Parliament, suggesting that it agrees powers held by the EU should go straight to Holyrood post-Brexit.

It recommends in future clear statements of circumstances under which legislative consent is not required by the convention should be clearly set out.  The MPs also:  *say England should be better represented in the constitution, warning a failure to do so \u0026ldquorisks a sense of increasing disconnection of the English people from the political system  *express concern about the Government\u0026rsquos attitude towards the post-Brexit UK common frameworks, calling on it to publish a coherent policy  *say current inter-governmental relationship mechanisms are \u0026ldquonot fit for purpose and recommend a fresh structure be established along with a new system for inter-parliamentary scrutiny to hold the governments of the UK to account.  The report calls for a devolution review in the year following Brexit, covering how Whitehall is structured and how it relates to the devolved administrations.  \u0026ldquoThis review, it says, \u0026ldquoshould also consider whether the role of the territorial offices in Whitehall and corresponding Secretaries of State are still necessary and, if they are, whether they might be reformed to promote better relations across Whitehall with the devolved administrations.

Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoThe EU Withdrawal Act is a power-grab on the Scottish Parliament and this report demonstrates that fundamental change is required within the UK Government to ensure devolution is respected.

Mr Russell added: \u0026ldquoThere has been little meaningful engagement throughout this process and it is time the UK Government respected the views of the Scottish Parliament and abandoned its pursuit of a hard Brexit.  His SNP colleague, Ronnie Cowan, who sits on the committee, said: \u0026ldquo\u0026lsquoWhat we are witnessing is a blatant Westminster power-grab after twenty years of devolution.  \u0026ldquoIt is the arrogance of the Tories who think they can rip up the devolution settlement and transfer powers to Westminster.

Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting.

It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

The association was formed in 1888.She also holds the mixed tandem record with Andy \u0026ldquoIron Man Wilkinson.Meanwhile, Moray long-distance runner Don Ritchie, who held the record between John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Land\u0026rsquos End, has died at the age of 73. He did the run in 1989 in 10 days, 15 hours and 27 minutes.The feat was achieved in what were described as \u0026ldquochallenging conditions. Mr Ritchie developed bronchitis and endured stomach and chest pains as well as regular nosebleeds as he ran his way into the record books.Mr Mowat said: \u0026ldquoHe was also the last Scot to hold the record which stood until 1996 when it was broken with a time of 10 days, two hours and 25 minutes by Richard Brown.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116742.jpg","title":"Prince Charles to visit Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspThe prince \u0026ndash also known as the Duke of Rothesay \u0026ndash is a regular visitor to the region, and last visited in 2017 when he did an impromptu tour of the various marquees at the Mey Highland and Cultural Games.Earlier this year, the future king declared himself a fan of the Groat, namechecking it as one of three newspapers he has \u0026ldquoenjoyed keeping in touch with.On Friday, the duke will visit Kongsberg Maritime, an important employer in Wick started by local entrepreneurs who trained at Dounreay.The company manufactures underwater cameras and harsh environment CCTV systems for subsea applications within different markets ranging from oil and gas, remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) technology, civil engineering and aquaculture.It employs and trains local people in skilled engineering and IT positions and was recently acquired by Imenco, a Norwegian company established in 1979.His royal highness will meet staff and have an opportunity to view the production process and see examples of the technology to learn about its application across the world.The duke is also scheduled to attend the young entrepreneurs and businesses event at Mackay\u0026rsquos Hotel.The event, organised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce and part of a series of events that take place throughout the year, aims to celebrate young entrepreneurs in the county and provide a networking opportunity with mentors and the agencies responsible for assisting and promoting business start-ups and entrepreneurship.There, he will meet civic leaders, chamber representatives, young business attendees and support agencies.In May, Prince Charles stressed his support for local newspapers, saying they \u0026ldquoprovide a vital service which is as important now as it has ever been.\u0026ldquoThese papers, and hundreds like them around the country, highlight so many of the important aspects of local community life in a way that no other media could hope to do, he said in a letter to marketing service Local Media Works.\u0026ldquoThere are countless examples of local newspapers acting as powerful and effective champions for their communities, and very often it is the local media that are first to a story and who stay with it long after the national media have moved on.\u0026ldquoLocal journalism is about giving communities a voice and empowering people with the knowledge to make informed decisions.\"Sometimes, a good local newspaper communicates the aspirations or concerns of the local community to a wider audience, putting local issues on the national agenda.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116692.jpg","title":"Sutherland spaceport opens up amazing opportunity for Dounreay site","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat\u0026rsquos the view of managing director Phil Craig after the Moine near Melness in north Sutherland was confirmed as the location for the spaceport.The announcement is expected to lead to a \u0026pound20 million investment, creating or sustaining an estimated 400 jobs and result in the launch of six small rockets a year.Dounreay, which is being decommissioned, has the engineering, scientific and technical skills to play a role in the spaceport. Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Tuesday 31 Jul 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services. They will need some convincing therefore that their interests lie at the heart of these proposals.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong.

Is Edinburgh in danger of killing the golden goose by pricing artists out of appearing at the Edinburgh Fringe? £500 for an overnight hotel stay is an eye-watering sum. But prices are high right across Scotland. Even in June a popular booking site had no hotel or bed and breakfast availability in the Oban and Lorn area for the entire week. A trip to Eigg earlier this month found only a couple of B\u0026ampBs for £70-£100 in the Mallaig-Arisaig area and “No vacancy” signs outside every camp/caravan site. Luckily, I stayed with friends whose summer months are now busy and sociable with cost-cutting visits from friends and family. When they travel elsewhere in Scotland, they do the same. It’s a great way to live and travel – if you have a wheen of like-minded, far-flung acquaintances with plenty of space. But if you don’t, the novel combination of brilliant summer weather and high staycationing demand from the rest of Britain creates a problem. Put simply, Scotland is fast becoming an impossibly expensive holiday location for folk actually living here.            The collapse in sterling since Brexit means a £100 bed and breakfast is less daunting for Europeans who also plan ahead. But Scots, prompted to explore their own country at the last minute by prolonged good weather and the relatively higher costs of foreign travel, are finding day trips or wild camping are the only “holidays” they can afford.            It doesn’t have to be like this.Across northern Europe and the world’s wooded latitudes, wooden weekend huts have traditionally come to the rescue, removing locals from the commercial holiday market and offering the possibility of long, leisurely stays during the summer, extended family reunions at Easter and sanity-restoring breaks every weekend throughout the year. Norway has the world’s highest GDP and the highest rate of hut ownership, with one basic wooden hut for every ten Norwegians. In 2006, there were 429,093 holiday homes in Norway, of which the vast majority (398,884) were huts rather than converted farmhouses (30,209) in a population of 4.6 million. A further 55,000 holiday homes were owned by Norwegians abroad. That’s one hytte (hut) per 11 Norwegians (roughly one per extended family) for year-round relaxation, connection with nature, exercise, escape from city pressures and strengthening family ties. Few huts have running water (thanks to freezing winters) although some have electricity and most are custom-built with wood-burning stoves. They are close enough to reach every weekend (usually within 25 miles and one hour’s drive) and the hytte habit is a marker of wealth, not poverty. Norway is one of the world’s most equal societies, and since second homes are generally modest purpose-built huts, not family homes from the local housing stock, ownership isn’t regarded as elitist, greedy or wasteful. A smart system called boplikt has created two separate housing markets by designating huts as temporary and family homes as permanent dwellings. Houses in each category cannot have a change of use. Thus family houses in remote areas cannot be bought or used as second homes. In 1991 there was also one cabin per 12 Swedes, one per 18 Finns and one per 33 Danes, along with widespread cabin ownership in Russia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain plus America, Canada and New Zealand.Scotland has the lowest rate of hut ownership in northern Europe. In 2000 only 630 huts remained in Scotland – most without rights of tenancy or improvement. Since then hundreds have been evicted, although Carbeth hutters raised almost £2 million to achieve a land buyout in 2013.            Of course, not everyone wants a basic, back-to-nature, wooden hut. But thousands do. And unless working families find the land and encouragement to take up hutting, holidays here will continue to be a greater luxury than a package holiday abroad and unemployed Scots will remain walled up in city estates without hope of escape. Maybe that’s a bigger social problem than the prices facing artists at the Edinburgh Fringe?"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775976.1532978152!/image/image.jpg","title":"public to have a say on naming inverness airport after loch ness","story":"        The public is to be consulted on plans to rebrand Inverness Airport as \u0026#8220Loch Ness Airport\u0026#8221.                Bosses there have launched a Twitter consultation to gauge support for the proposal. They are asking: “Should we change our name to Inverness Loch Ness Airport?”             As of yesterday evening, around 400 votes had been cast with a large majority against the move.             The controversial name change suggestion has previously been mooted by \u2028local business and tourism chiefs. Willie Cameron, business development director for Cobbs Group, said he is “100 per cent behind” the name change and believes now is the right time for it, particularly given the growing market for travel in Scotland from the Far East. He said most bookings are done through smartphone and tablet devices and tourists will have a greater appreciation of the Loch Ness name, with a rebranding working better for search engine optimisation. Mr Cameron said: “I think the team at Inverness Airport is doing a great job by working hard to get more flights in there. They are also going to get the new train station coming in there as part of the future plans. “I would say expand the airport and runway.             “If it turns out that the public want them to change the name, it will enhance the number of international carriers coming into the airport.” He added that the Inverness name change was just as plausible as Liverpool changing its name to John Lennon Airport, which is iconic for that area. Stewart Nicol, Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive, said that his team have promoted the idea in the past, adding: “A name change immediately identifies the airport with one of the biggest draws to the region for tourism. Loch Ness is iconic across the globe.” A Highlands and Islands Airport Ltd spokesman said: “The idea of including Loch Ness in the name of Inverness Airport has been raised in the past and we thought it would be interesting to gauge the response from the public.             “As yet there are no plans to take the idea further.” It is understood that the idea would only be taken further through major backing from several tourism agencies, including the likes of VisitScotland.

He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn!

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"communities minister makes isles her first port of call ","story":"\nCabinet secretary Aileen Campbell pours soap mixture into a mould under the watchful eye of Louise Jamieson.

The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nTuesday 31 Jul 2018 1:37 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

They need to be clear as to whether they are prepared to defend a lack of integrity in public office,\" she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27426  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nJoint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference met today in London today for the first time in ten years. \nThe body involves ministers from both the British and Irish governments meeting to discuss a range of issues was created by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. \nThe conference has not met since 2007, shortly before the return of the political institutions in the north when Sinn Féin and the DUP agreed to share power. \nSinn Féin have been calling for a meeting of the conference to be convened ever since the DUP collapsed talks designed to reestablish an Executive in February. \nSinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill welcomed today\u0027s meeting, describing it as an \"important step\" towards power sharing. \n“Today’s conference of both the Irish and British Governments is an important step to help remove the obstacles to genuine power-sharing and for London and Dublin to fulfil their own obligations in respect to the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and other outstanding matters relating to citizens\u0027 rights, legacy matters and All-Ireland co-operation.\n“In the absence of the Assembly and Executive at this time, the choice is between the protection of the Good Friday Agreement which is under constant attack, by the hard Brexiteers within the DUP and Tory party, or its abandonment.\n“We have made clear that for Irish nationalism any return to British direct rule would represent its abandonment and is therefore unacceptable.\nMichelle O\u0027Neill said both the British and Irish governments have a responsibility to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented. \n“Together both governments have a clear duty under the Good Friday Agreement to make determined efforts to support the re-establishment of the institutions.\n“Joint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.\n“The conference allows both governments to co-operate at all levels on all matters and despite the fact they allowed it to lapse, having not met since 2007, we welcome today’s meeting and the fact the Governments themselves are getting back on board with this process,\" she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27427  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language - Declan Kearney\nAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough council is overwhelmingly unionist.\nThe Borough makes up the larger part of my South Antrim constituency.\nOn the 26th February last the council rejected a petition to support the provision of bilingual (English and Irish) streets/roads signage in the area.\nUnionist councillors then decided to go a step further and passed a motion committing Antrim and Newtownabbey council to an ‘English only’ policy.\n\nThat was a ridiculous and stupid stance to adopt.\nIt is also unlawful.\nThis new council policy is in breach of Article 11 of the Local Government Order 1995, and it violates the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.\nBut it is also an affront to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality enshrined within the Good Friday Agreement (GFA).\nThe decision taken was a deeply insulting message aimed directly at those who live and pay rates within Antrim and Newtownabbey who identify as Irish citizens, who cherish the Irish language, and Gaelic cultural traditions.\nIt does not matter in the narrow, blinkered world of those who control political unionism in Antrim and Newtownabbey council that the Irish language and cultural identity actually matters to a significant section of rate payers in the borough.\nThe Gaelic Athletic Association runs deep in this part of County Antrim. It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8584719.1532965107!/image/image.jpg","title":"getting red y for lurgan park run","story":"\nLocals are being urged to get their outfits \u0026#8216red-y\u0026#8217 and take part in the first Red Dress Run at Lurgan Park on August 19 in aid of Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke.\n\n                \nThe call comes from Gillian Abraham, Northern Ireland Chest Heart and Stroke’s Ambassador.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe is encouraging locals to attend the event which will see flamboyantly dressed men, women and children take part in a 5k or 10k walk or run. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe event aims to raise awareness of heart disease as well as raising funds to help combat this biggest single killer of men and women in Northern Ireland.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nGillian has NICHS close to her heart after losing her dad to a heart attack and her mum has had ongoing heart conditions as well as a mini stroke. \n\nShe said: “My aim is to get as many people as possible to take part in the Red Dress Run and raise money so NICHS can fund lifesaving research into heart disease.  \n\n“You never know when your family might be affected.”\n\nIt has also been announced that Lurgan personal trainer, Hayley Guiseley, also known as ‘Strong Maiden PT’ will be holding a warm up before the event kicks off at 11am so runners and walkers are advised to get there early to ensure they don’t miss out.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nRunners and walkers of all abilities will each receive a medal, goody bag and, above all, enjoy a fun morning out for a great cause.\n\nEntry is £10 online and £15 on the day.

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27.

A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
