He lost his children, his wife, and his international standing after Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the Family Division, found he had conducted a ‘campaign of fear and intimidation’ against Princess Haya, forcing her to flee to London with their two children last April.         Dubai\u0027s Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (right) and his wife Princess Haya bint Al Hussein arrive for the first day of the Royal Ascot race meeting June 16, 2009The judge also found the sheikh ‘ordered and orchestrated’ the kidnap of Princess Latifa, who was snatched from a boat in the Arabian Sea in 2018. She and Shamsa are still captive in Dubai.Sir Andrew said the sheikh’s actions, on balance of probabilities, ran ‘contrary to the criminal law of England and Wales, international law and internationally accepted human rights norms’. The sheikh, who did not attend court, denies any wrongdoing. He repeatedly tried to keep the findings secret but the case was ruled to be in the public interest.Mr Beck said he had never forgotten the plight of Princess Shamsa, who ran away at 19 because of her father’s oppressive treatment of women and girls.She fled his Surrey estate, but after weeks on the run she says that after visiting a pub in Cambridge she was grabbed by four of armed heavies, injected with sedatives and taken back to Dubai.         In mid-July 2000 the ‘headstrong’ then 19-year-old princess – reportedly angry her father wouldn’t let her go to university and disgusted by Dubai’s human rights record – evaded high-security at her father’s sprawling Longcross estate (pictured) in Surrey, where the family spent most summersYesterday, both Tony Blair, who was prime minister in 2000, and Jack Straw, who became foreign secretary in 2001, denied any knowledge of the case. And Number 10 sources insisted the Foreign Office had ‘no role in the investigation or outcome’. But Labour’s Shami Chakrabarti, shadow attorney general, said: ‘This is clearly a shocking judgment. She called for an urgent probe into ‘why a criminal inquiry into a kidnap in Cambridge appears to have been impeded’.Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke backed calls for a probe and Kate Allen of Amnesty International said: ‘No one is above the law.’ Announcing a review yesterday, Cambridgeshire Police said their investigations in 2001 and 2017, were called off due to ‘insufficient evidence’.The British Horseracing Authority faces calls to review the sheikh’s registration.

This is a theoretical method of transmission – poor sanitation caused many SARS infections – but there is no evidence yet that Covid-19 has been passed on like this.HOW DOES IT MAKE US ILL?By forcing the lung cells of the infected person to replicate its RNA, Covid-19 disrupts normal respiratory functioning. This includes the constant waving motion of cilia: tiny hair-like projections in the lungs which sweep out mucus and dirt or particles that have been breathed in from the air around us.With this vital defence mechanism impaired, the lungs are more vulnerable to potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.We know that our immune systems are strongest when we are younger, so it is not surprising that children appear to be the least vulnerable to developing the worst symptoms of coronavirus.The opposite is true of elderly people, especially if their lung function is already compromised – for example, by life-long smoking or conditions like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).       In people of all ages, the symptoms can be worsened when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive in its response to infection. White blood cells dispatched to fight the virus and reduce the inflammation in the lungs can damage healthy cells in the process.The fever experienced by many victims is another immune response, with the body raising its internal temperature to a level at which the virus can no longer operate.The majority of people infected with Covid-19 will experience symptoms so mild that they will not even know that they have had the disease.WHAT IS THE VIRUS’S ‘AGGRESSIVE’ STRAIN?Viruses mutate all the time and what the Chinese scientists have identified is a minor variation (known as L-type) to the existing Covid-19 (S-type) rather than a new and insidious new virus.The word ‘aggressive’ is being used to describe it but the facts are less alarming. The S-type which kicked off the epidemic in China appears to be milder and less infectious L-type seems to be more infectious – it currently accounts for 70 per cent of cases – but does not appear to be causing symptoms that are any worse.Bear in mind that new strains of influenza are evolving constantly. That is why our annual flu jabs contain two or three different vaccines which change year on year.Any future vaccine against Covid-19 will similarly take account of the different strains out there.WILL IT DIE DOWN OVER THE SUMMER?Respiratory infections are certainly more common in winter. There is no simple explanation for this, but one theory is that viruses can survive longer in colder weather when there is less UV radiation (which can kill microbes) from sunlight bearing down on the hard surfaces on which they linger.Or it may be that people get together in confined spaces more often in winter.Whatever the explanation, there is no way of knowing what warmer weather will bring for the coronavirus. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, UK cases peaked in July.CAN YOU COMPLETELY PROTECT YOURSELF?Short of wearing a spacesuit, or stopping the people around you from breathing, the answer is no.But public health control measures proved highly effective in eradicating SARS in 20022003.Even if we are not completely rid of Covid-19, it may eventually evolve into different strains of the common cold – a recurring winter infection which many of us build immunity to, having caught it once.That said, there is no room for complacency. And if we can draw anything positive from the spread of Covid-19, it’s as a reminder that we cannot skimp on funding if science is to keep pace with the ever-evolving threats to our health both now and in the future. "},{"url":null,"title":"Thirsty animals perfectly reflected watering hole South Africa","story":"Share this article          A white rhino, which is listed as near threatened by the IUCN, visits the watering hole.

Often given to self-reinvention, Paterson has always kept musical panache at the forefront of his multi-award-winning verse, be it in the laddish smarts of Nil Nil, the paternal meditations of Landing Light, or the metaphysical reach of Rain. This new book is not only his most seemingly confessional, but also a stylistic departure. Taking its cues from the first season of the TV classic The Twilight Zone, its often surreal, long-lined narratives jump from funny to sad to profound with a suppleness somewhere between Frank O’Hara and CK Williams. “I am trying hard not to be that guy,” sighs the speaker in one poem, “and while I can fall prey to bitterness, I refuse to sound like some middle-aged incel addicted to Jordan Peterson videos.” The poet’s cutting wit and acute awareness aside, the best poems here are the reimagined character portraits that bookend the collection: “Lazarus”, in which self-improvement meets the Orphic contemplation of the void and “Death”, in which a self-deceiving salesman tries to buy off the grim reaper.JO Morgan won the Aldeburgh first collection prize in 2009 for a book-length poem that recounted a childhood on the Isle of Skye. In his seventh volume, The Martian’s Regress (Cape, £10), he has quietly established himself as a gifted writer of the long poem. His previous book, Assurances, was an intimate presentation of his father’s involvement in maintaining Britain’s airborne nuclear deterrent. The Martian’s Regress is an imaginative leap, in its story of environmental collapse and a fragile humanity, though it mines not dissimilar terrain in conjuring familiar dystopias: “Waking from his nightmare  The pressing blackness of the air  Failed to hide the martian from himself.  The nightmare too had woken”. In portraying the variously hopeful, hopeless, comic and bleak ways of apparent aliens, Morgan brings us closer to ourselves.Numinous musicality remains a hallmark of the former violinist Fiona Sampson’s poetry. Come Down (Corsair, £10.99) traces the meeting points of our fleeting human lives and the shifting timelessness of the world that surrounds us, be it “cool stone” as “our voices  lick at space”, or words that “make a wavering  line in snow”. Free from punctuation except for the odd dash or question mark, Sampson’s poems refuse to stay still, intent on pursuing lines of inquiry into what it all means: “Wet stone smells  of lost meaning smells  of mysterious  wise intention  the unlived-in stonework  drawing back from us”. But Come Down also faces up to precise human hurt, most hauntingly in the sexual damage of “Old Man”, and the titular long poem, exploring place, memory and the chasms of history.David Harsent is the modern master of what could be called the poem noir. His formally adept work often draws a solitary character into disturbing, half-apprehended horrors, as the human psyche casts and conjures its shadows in an unforgiving world. In Loss (Faber, £14.99), we join an eerie narrative that begins at “00:00 and the full of night to come”, as visionary insomnia engulfs a man confronting personal and public losses. While unremittingly bleak, this book-length poetic sequence is powerful in its metaphorical reach: “Children in a pool of light, a pool of dust the way  images deceive, the way time shunts and stalls, a test  of what gathers and corrupts”. Like the best poets, Harsent reminds us what it is to lose sight of ourselves, as we might “meditate  on the effect of pain but never on its cause”.• Ben Wilkinson’s Way More Than Luck is published by Seren.

Her debut novel, After the Fire, a Still Small Voice (2009), won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize her next, All the Birds, Singing, was published in 2013, the year she was named one of Granta’s best young British novelists. Her new book, The Bass Rock, published later this month, tells the story of three interlinked women across several centuries and explores the ways that men seek to subjugate women and how women fight back. In the 1700s, Sarah is accused of being a witch after the second world war, Ruth marries a widower and becomes a mother to his sons and in the present day Viv is lost and mourning her father.How did the book’s structure come about?I had a newborn at the time I started writing it five years ago. I was writing when he was asleep. A couple of hours in the morning, an hour in the afternoon. I didn’t really have time to sit down and think, you know, what am I working on?So I ended up writing lots of different time frames and probably about two other novels underneath this one. I wasn’t even sure if it was all the same book. It was really when #MeToo happened that I saw I was writing about the same thing. The same problem, just a slightly different shape, I suppose.Where does the rage and anger expressed in the book come from?I think it’s the same anger and rage that every woman has deep down, squashed down somewhere. It probably comes from it being ingrained into us that we’re not supposed to be angry, or we aren’t angry, we’re “hysterical”, “difficult”. There are quite a few murders in the book and one of the things I was really interested in was how women historically are always told to ignore their sixth sense, the hairs going up on the back of their neck, that feeling of discomfort. Whether it’s as a child when you have to cuddle the uncle, or just that feeling that the worst thing in the world would be to be impolite. So when somebody comes up to you on the tube and asks you what you’re reading, and wants to butt into your life and you feel like if I say “please leave me alone”, what’s going to happen is this tirade of “I’m just trying to be friendly”. All the feeling that you don’t even register any more – every time somebody passes you on an empty street in the dark and you have this sort of countdown in your head and you’re like, “Nope, it’s all right, I don’t need the keys in the fist.” And the fact that that is just part of your life.Have you experienced any of the horrendous things that occur in the book?The thing that amazed me was that, when I started talking to my female friends about it, a huge number of them had it happen to them, and far worse. But it just wasn’t something they’d talk about... it’s the nature of the drug it affects the chemicals in your brain, you feel guilt and dread for a long time afterwards, so you just want to forget about it.Simon Armitage recently said that his writing is a conversation with all the writers he reads and admires – who would that be for you?When I was a kid I read so much Stephen King, and there are parts of his work that I always feel like I’m in conversation with – about what is frightening and why. That really interests me. I think his endings are always a bit of a letdown, because it’s like... showing the monster. I think I’m always interested in how to start off big and exciting and interesting and still have an ending that doesn’t disappoint, but doesn’t wrap things up neatly. Another one would be Tim Winton and his book The Riders.You live in south London and part-own a bookshop, Review, in Peckham. Do you still work there?I’m not behind the counter any more. I wander in and get in the way nowadays. The manager is a fantastic bookseller and I go in and offer a hand. I bring the wine.What was the last really great book you read?I’ve just read Megan Hunter’s forthcoming book, The Harpy, which is incredible Also, Lucy Fry’s Easier Ways to Say I Love You, a memoir about being in a polyamorous marriage.Do you know what your next book is about?No, I’m still really in the headspace of the last one, which hasn’t really happened before. Normally I’m desperate to get on with the next one.• The Bass Rock by Evie Wyld is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 020-3176 3837.

He added: “In places, at its worst, Noughts \u0026amp Crosses stoops to naked race-baiting, stirring up antipathy under the pretence of attacking racist attitudes.”Robinson’s comments have been supported by online commentators and on Saturday Blackman responded. “To those accusing me of being anti-white or stating I must hate white people to create such a story as Noughts \u0026amp Crosses, I’m not even going to dignify your absurd nonsense with a response. Go take a seat waaaay over there in the cold, dark and bitter haters’ corner,” she wrote.Her comment was retweeted by the actor Jack Rowan, who plays one of the drama’s star-crossed young lovers. “You tell ’em!” he encouraged the author, whose defence was supported and retweeted by a long line of fans.Blackman had already responded on Friday to the many viewers who told her they had enjoyed the first episode. She tweeted: “THANK YOU to all those who have sent me lovely messages … So many talented, wonderful people involved in bringing it to the screen – producers, scriptwriters, cast and crew. I see you. I appreciate you.”Robinson, who describes himself as mixed race, focused his attack on what he regarded as an exaggeration of the problem.“Of course there are serious issues in this country, stemming from multiculturalism, immigration and nationalism. I know a lot about them. But I didn’t see any of these real problems reflected in Noughts \u0026amp Crosses … All this will do is polarise viewers, encourage isiveness and drown out the real debate.”The actor Paterson Joseph, who stars in the series, last month predicted the drama would stir up strong feelings: “When you’re shooting, you know it’s significant because you know it’s going to upset some people, maybe a lot of people, on both sides of the ethnic lines.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95e7f8a691ad3e6af55d90504359b1e5dfc377f/0_1322_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11a949ca285ac0fae19f9eca4aa3b6c3","title":"recollections my non existence rebecca solnit review","story":"The acclaimed feminist writer on her formative years, feeling silenced and the first room of her own – a light-filled flat in San Francisco One Sunday in 1980, the 19-year-old Rebecca Solnit went to see the studio flat in San Francisco that would be her home for the next 26 years. She’d been living in hostels since she moved away from her parents a few years earlier, so this was the first room of her own. She found in the corner studio in Lyon Street, with its light-filled bay windows and golden oak floors, the beginnings of an adult identity. She filled the space with things collected on walks – lichen-covered twigs, birds’ nests, bones – and with old furniture and books. She didn’t yet know that she was a feminist or a writer but she knew that she was a reader and that she was outraged by the expectations of the men around her, whether it was the male poets seeking a muse or the men who followed her in the street, making her panic that she could end up as one of the women she read about in news reports: “beatnik girl slain by sailor looking for love”.Recollections of My Non-Existence announces itself as a memoir that will reveal how this skinny, friendless girl found her voice and her place in the world. There’s a lot of first person writing across Solnit’s books. She has always used her own experience, describing herself walking across cities and deserts, or evading the violence or speechifying of men. And her take on culture is original enough that it wouldn’t be surprising if her take on memoir was original too. But this book feels a little thin, because she’s not an introspective writer. She’s not curious about the relationship between thoughts and feelings or about her own ambivalence or contradictions. There is not here the plunge inwards, the giddying rush of embodied thinking, that we get in, say, Maggie Nelson’s The Argonauts.Solnit’s title is in part an acknowledgement of this, and some of the book’s most striking passages are about non-existence. “To be a young woman is to face your own annihilation in innumerable ways,” she writes at the start, “or to flee it or the knowledge of it, or all these things at once.” There’s a personal point here. She suggests that, partly because of her violent father, she became “expert at fading and slipping and sneaking away … dodging unwanted hugs and kisses and hands … at the art of non-existence, since existence was so perilous”. She associates this, intriguingly, with her love of reading, suggesting that when she read, she “ceased to be myself, and this non-existence I pursued and devoured like a drug”. And she describes how this desire to escape coexisted with fantasies of daring combat and a preoccupation with armour. As always with Solnit, though, this becomes part of a larger political point, because she thinks, rightly, that though male violence affected her “in profoundly personal ways” the cure wasn’t a personal one but rather the public sea-change brought about by feminism. This may be true, but it doesn’t tell us much about Solnit. In the absence of introspection or of a detailed account of her early life, Solnit tells the story of male violence. This is most powerful when it’s centred on her own youthful experiences. There’s a frightening passage where she describes walking home late at night after a party followed by a large man: “His shadow and mine swelled and shrank from streetlight to streetlight, and cars passed by and their headlights made all the shadows swirl and vanish.” This scene, together with the early accounts of friend-making and city life, reminded me of Siri Hustvedt’s recent autofictional novel Memories of the Future, which describes Hustvedt’s move to her first flat in New York in 1978. A striking amount of the material is similar, from the shabby flats in run-down neighbourhoods to the in-jokes with friends and the early attempts at writing. In both cases, there’s a feeling of being silenced by men (“over and over, I have spoken and not been heard”, Hustvedt writes) and in both cases there’s a reflective curiosity about the relationship between the sexagenarian narrator and the recollected girl. Here’s Hustvedt: “I hover above the self that met and then wrote about Wanda. I am somewhere near the cracked ceiling of the shabby, nearly empty apartment.” And here’s Solnit: “that long-ago girl was not exactly me, not like me at all in crucial ways, but me anyway, an awkward misfit, a daydreamer, a restless wanderer.”The comparison helps to clarify why Solnit’s book feels a little insubstantial. In Hustvedt’s, there’s not all that much introspection, but there’s a willingness to dwell with the flat itself, to turn it into the setting of a kind of Shandean play, where the furniture, the neighbours and the visiting friends and boyfriends come alive. This makes for a more satisfyingly abundant book and allows the violent scenes (“a girl who comes with me leaves with me”, her near-rapist tells her) to provoke a more lived shock in the reader.Solnit’s book has some great moments of observation and some very fine writing. Fans will be pleased with her defence of her own meandering voice against the Hemingwayesque terseness she was taught at journalism school: “I wanted to trace the lost patterns that came before the world was broken and find the new ones we could make out of the shards.” There’s a compelling passage on penetration, where she suggests that men who see sexual penetration as a way of gaining power over women and making themselves invulnerable would do well to remember that “everyone is interdependent. Everyone is vulnerable. Everyone is penetrable, and everyone is penetrated incessantly by the vibrations of sound travelling into the inner ear.”As always, she’s brilliant on art, appreciating male artists, and especially the gay men who helped her interrogate gender norms and find a voice, at the same time as seeing the sexism of the Beat poets and artists (“how do you make art when the art that’s all around you keeps telling you to shut up and do the dishes?”), among others. There is some terrific social description of the streets surrounding her Lyon Street flat, filled with places of worship, with shops doubling as museums (there’s a dry cleaner with a display of antique irons) and bordered by a 19th-century cemetery district not long cleared of its dead. With a writer of this stature, there’s a value, too, in the signposting of her career. She shows us how she began (the journalism course coinciding with a fortuitous student job at the Museum of Modern Art), and shows us in broad brushstrokes how her books emerged from her experiences and preoccupations, as she embraced in turn environmentalism, activism and feminism.But there isn’t the determined concentration of her Wanderlust, which manages to be both compendious and wilful as a guide to walking through the ages, and in which the more angrily personal passages speak easily to the more researched, distant material. And there isn’t the fiery lyricism of A Field Guide to Getting Lost, with its sustained meditation on desire and on our longing to reach the blue hills seen in the distance, even while knowing that close up they will always be brown or green. Perhaps there was a necessary non-existence in the writing in these books that is imperilled by a memoir perhaps Solnit is rightly concerned to protect herself from the dangers that inhabiting herself too fully might entail.• Lara Feigel’s Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing is published by Bloomsbury.

Rijneveld’s response to this early confrontation with the unthinkable was not to draw a veil over it, but to build two books around it. “I think it’s unfortunate for a family to have a writer born into it,” says the 28-year-old author, serenely.In the devoutly religious rural community among which the Rijneveld family still live, the exposure was sudden and extreme. When Calf’s Caul, a poetry collection, was published in 2015, its young author was heralded in the national media as a new star of Dutch literature. More challenging still for the family was the novel that arrived three years later, De avond is ongemak, which appears in English this week as The Discomfort of Evening (Faber, translated by Michelle Hutchison), and has just been longlisted for the International Booker prize. “All the shopkeepers and the hairdresser were talking about it, but my family are too frightened to read it,” says Rijneveld, who uses the pronouns theythem.In The Discomfort of Evening, Matthies dies in a skating accident, leaving his 10-year-old sister Jas fantasising about how to prevent the family from being destroyed in the aftermath. She keeps two toads in a box under her bed, thinking that if they can be persuaded to mate, her parents might too, and everything will be all right again. Meanwhile, left to cope with the emotional turbulence of adolescence without adult support, she plays games with her surviving brother and sister that become increasingly wild and dangerous.The novel is set over the two years in Jas’s life when hormones corral children into adult sexual identities. Rijneveld resists such categorisation, self‑describing not as trans but as “in between”. “As a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school.” Their middle name, Lucas, comes from an imaginary boyfriend they had as a young child. Elegantly dressed in trademark suit and braces, Rijneveld’s composure only breaks when they struggle to remember the name of the film star they aspire to be. It finally emerges in a burst of giggles: “Timothée Chalamet, star of Call Me by Your Name – I want to be a beautiful boy.”They have not yet decided whether to take hormone treatment, so when they read their work publicly it is in an unbroken voice, radiating an androgynous charm that has made them one of the poetry circuit’s rare breakout stars. “What a sweetheart,” wrote a commenter in response to a Dutch TV chatshow on the environment, in which Rijneveld signed up to the David Attenborough fan club, urged listeners to heed his warnings about the climate emergency and reported that they had never flown in a plane.Only their hands betray their other life as a one-day-a-week dairy farmer, with scrubbed nails that are bitten to the quick. “Farming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit.”This unglamorous side of farming slops through both the novel and the poems. Jas’s mother doses her children with worm medicine and slathers them with udder ointment to protect against the cold. One of the poems in Calf’s Caul is titled “Lice Mothers”. “People from the city get scared of these things that villagers think of as normal.” For example? “For example, torturing frogs – it’s not very nice but it happens and children will experiment with it.”Despite being published three years apart, the novel and poetry collection began in tandem, even sharing some lines. “The challenge was how to write them when I didn’t have many memories of my brother’s death. So I started with Matthies, and only during the writing arrived at the shape the novel has now. I saw Calf’s Caul as preparation for writing The Discomfort of Evening.”The collection, which has yet to be published in English, is full of the anxieties that Rijneveld’s chosen identity has created in a family who are god-fearing members of the Reformed church. “Papa has been searching for a daughter for years,” reads one poem. “It’s difficult for my parents to understand that I’m not the girl that they raised,” Rijneveld says. “It’s not in the Bible.”Whether the papa of the poems is any more Rijneveld’s own father than Jas’s papa in the novel is left open by a writer who admits that they regard their public identity as a performance, to be donned along with the braces. “Writing is playing with who you are. Being an author makes me feel more confident.”Rijneveld was born on 20 April 1991 on a farm in the north Brabant, a province in the south of the Netherlands. The date is significant, they disarmingly disclose, because it means they share a birthday with Adolf Hitler. “As a child I thought it was a funny idea to be born on the same day as such a monstrous man, but it made me wonder if I was a good or a bad person.” In the novel, Jas builds a fantasy about a Jewish family her mother has hidden away in the basement. She acts out her social alienation by making a Nazi salute at school and cracking a joke which was judged too offensive for the English edition of the novel.It’s part of a strand of black humour that is as dangerous in its way as the children’s games (one gruesome scene involves a dummy cow and an insemination gun). Asked why the novel pushes so hard at boundaries of what is acceptable, the author shrugs: “It is related by a child and children are naive. They say these things. They don’t know any better, so they can get away with an innocent joke.”At nine years old, Rijneveld says, “I had a very strong belief in God and was convinced he was living in the attic.” The novel is full of glimpses into what it was like growing up in a strict religious household. Jas’s father restricts their TV channels for fear of nudity, which he pronounces “as if a fruit fly had just flown into his mouth – he spat as he said it” her mother daringly watches a quiz show involving words that are not in the Bible. “She called them ‘blush words’ because some of them made your cheeks turn red.” When her children try out these words, she attempts “to wash them out of our mouths with a bar of green soap, like the grease stains from our good school clothes”.Of their own experience Rijneveld simply says: “Behind the book is such a strong force. After leaving school I didn’t know what to do. I started living in a room in a new city and I just knew I had to write it. In daily life it’s hard to be as strong as I am behind my laptop.” They now live in Utrecht, and work on a farm that is not their parents’.There are only two responses to the death of a child, Rijneveld says: either it draws a family closer or rips them apart. So what happened in their own family? “I have to think about the answer to that … ” Rijneveld says solemnly. “No, it hasn’t torn us apart, but all the relationships changed.” One brother and sister are now teachers, and a second brother is in the police. None of them has read the novel. “I hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud that they will understand it’s a novel, it’s not all about them. But it is probably too soon.”Meanwhile Rijneveld’s writing has gained them a new cultural family, which stretches beyond the Netherlands to Italy and Germany. Calf’s Caul has gone through 11 editions to date in Dutch while The Discomfort of Evening has sold 55,000 copies in the Netherlands it will be published in French in April and is currently being translated into Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Arabic. A second poetry collection is already out, and Rijneveld is working on a second novel. All of which bears out their fervent belief that “there’s always light in darkness, just as there’s always humour in gruesomeness. It’s just the way things work. There must always be something to laugh about.” Claire Armitstead• Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s The Discomfort of Evening, translated by Michelle Hutchison, is published by Faber in the UK and out now.As a young man travelling around Europe in the late 1990s, the Malmö-based writer Andrzej Tichý remembers telling friends about the conditions endured by marginalised groups in Sweden. “And they just would not believe me,” he recalls. “From the outside Sweden was this harmonious, social democratic paradise and people preferred to believe the folk hymn that here was a society that looked after everyone. But it was never actually true.” He cites historic state-sanctioned forced sterilisations of those deemed to be mentally or physically impaired, and discrimination against Jews, Roma and indigenous peoples. “And there has always been the day-to-day treatment of the poor and of immigrants, let alone the junkies and criminals,” he adds. “Of course there were places in the world that were worse, but Sweden was never perfect.”The poor and the immigrants, the junkies and the criminals, loom large in Tichý’s prize-winning novel Wretchedness (Eländet, translated by Nichola Smalley) which will be published in the UK in June by And Other Stories. It is his fifth novel, but the first to appear in English, and opens with a cellist on his way to a classical concert being asked for money by a drug addict on the street. The encounter summons a swirling sequence of flashbacks from the cellist’s own chaotic past. Graphic depictions of crime, racism, poverty, drug use and violence are rendered through paragraph-free slabs of text that propulsively veer between voices and minds, times and locations: “Suddenly my mouth is full of it again,” the musician declares, “of names and places, of events and movements, of memories and images.” The inescapable realisation is how easy it would have been for him to have become that junkie.Tichý was born in Prague in 1978 to a Czech father and Polish mother. His family moved to Sweden when he was three, and he was brought up on a Malmö housing estate with a large migrant population not unlike the one featured in Wretchedness. “I’m not interested in autobiography or autofiction, but I know there are always borderline areas between the writer and the subject and I am not a stranger to many of the things in the novel. Much comes from personal experience, although sometimes indirectly.”As well as the Swedish estates, the novel draws on Tichý’s experiences of living in Hamburg and London to paint a picture of a pan-European community of the excluded passing through squats, underground clubs, petty scams and cash-only employment.This internationalism is also reflected in the language he deploys. “A lot of it is written in a sort of slang encompassing many different languages. Some words have long been incorporated into standard Swedish, from Roma for example. But now there are also a lot of Arab words, Serbo-Croat, Polish, Spanish, Albanian. It’s all mixed together, but interestingly while one sentence can contain several different languages, people will know what you mean.”Tichý’s early creative life centered on music – playing guitar in the hardcore scene rather than classical cello – which led to him starting up fanzines for which he first wrote poetry and then prose. There is a sense of musicality inherent in the dense text of Wretchedness, as episodes from the composer’s past repeatedly return, with references ranging from Snoop Dogg and Mobb Deep’s hip-hop to the concert hall avant garde of Julius Eastman and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi’s atonal drones. (There is a coolly eclectic Spotify playlist that accompanies the book).Literary and philosophical influences include Simone Weil and Thomas Bernhard, and Tichý admits that his is a potentially demanding kind of literature. “I sometimes go out and talk to young people on the estates, people not really interested in books, and some of them find it hard. But they are interested in the themes, which is partly why rap lyrics have always been a huge influence on me. They can be complex and sophisticated yet can describe street stuff in a wonderfully direct and concise manner and so make art out of what is thought of as low life.“That is partly my project too. I’ve always wanted to depict lives and environments under-explored by literature. These lives not only deserve to be chronicled, they deserve to be elevated.” Nicholas Wroe• Andrzej Tichy’s Wretchedness, translated by Nichola Smalley, will be published by And Other Stories in the UK in June.It is no longer the curse of the Irish author to be compared to James Joyce: these days, if they happen to be sharp, socially conscious and writing about twentysomethings living now, they will be announced as the new Sally Rooney, and also as some kind of child prodigy, even when they are well into their 20s. Naoise Dolan, 27, finds this all hilarious. “In any other career, it is completely normal to get going in your 20s – we’ve just normalised the desperate state of affairs around writing,” she says. “And the idea that young women couldn’t ever have had an emotional or interesting life, or that it’s somehow cringeworthy to capture the present moment – both are ridiculous to me.”Despite the inevitable comparisons, Dolan’s debut, Exciting Times, published in April by Weidenfeld, is more caustic and cynical than Rooney’s writing, if just as clever. It follows Ava, a 22-year-old who had “been sad in Dublin, decided it was Dublin’s fault and thought Hong Kong would help”. There she meets 29-year-old banker Julian, an only child who went to Eton. (“These were the two least surprising facts anyone had ever told me about themselves,” Ava notes.) Their relationship is sexual, if carefully ambiguous, and is built mostly on their mutual enjoyment of acidic banter over any deeply-felt romance. Ava admires Julian’s cushions and willingness to give her his credit cards his highest praise for her is that she is “good company”: “Really it was amusing that we were having sex,” Ava muses. “He was attractive and confident, whereas I was willing to centre my emotional life around someone who treated me like a favoured armrest.” When Julian temporarily moves away, Ava meets Edith, a young and wealthy Hong Kong lawyer. It is here that Dolan’s novel feels most contemporaneous all the fretting over love and class could be compared to Austen or Wharton, but her light treatment of bisexuality and polyamory is utterly 2020. Ava, Julian and Edith are never really a love triangle but a hinge, with Ava in the middle of two people who benignly tolerate each other. The only drama in their arrangement lies in the choice Ava feels she must make, despite Julian’s indifference and Edith saying things like: “I have many opinions about the nexus between monogamy and patriarchy, opinions which are available on request should they interest you.”Dolan is less interested in sexuality than in relationships: “Sexuality only affects the ability to be attracted to someone – how that manifests is more about who that person is. As a queer person, I have no understanding how it might feel different to experience heterosexual attraction, though I’m quite interested in that. But there are plenty of novels about straight people already. And I think it is more interesting to write about relationships without the assumption that it has to be a monogamous one.” She suspects older readers will be baffled by the dynamic. “There is this expectation that you should write to people who are powerful in ways that you’re not, to explain to them why you’re different. I think it’s better to just throw it out there and if they don’t like it, fine. For people my age, the most important question is: are you treating your partners well or poorly?” When in conversation with older writers, she says, “I sometimes feel like I’m trying to prove that it’s OK to write stories about people who aren’t them. It’s not a gendered thing, there is a class element too. A lot of things that we call ‘the millennial experience’ were always part of a universal experience for some social groups – middle-class people are just upset that those things are happening to them now.”Dolan grew up in Dublin, studied English at Trinity College and was published in Stinging Fly magazine – by Rooney, who was editor until 2019. (This makes Dolan “such an Irish cliche”, she says.) She was always interested in literature, but never had any aspirations to write – “firstly because it’s not financially possible for most people, and secondly, I don’t stake a significant amount of my self-image in how I relate to the modes of production. It was a hobby, not a career goal. I have a limited amount of patience for the writer-as-personality thing – it is a very mechanical and somewhat distant thing for me. I just make things up. I don’t relate to accounts that people give of being struck by ideas or their characters taking over. Writing was always just kind of something that I plugged away at.”Dolan, who is autistic, “doesn’t like talking to people”, so to get away from colleagues and students at her teaching job, she spent five months hiding in coffeeshops on her lunch breaks. “I find it easier to relate to people by thinking about why they are the way they are. I aim to observe people rather than empathise with them,” she says. And her observations are brilliant, often simultaneously comic and bleak. “Julian often reminded me to eat. It made him feel better about liking that I was thin,” Ava notes. Or, at a party: “Ralph’s girlfriend Victoria was good at wearing clothes. She was so beautiful I couldn’t see why she was talking to me. Sometimes her eyes said: I don’t know why, either.”With the emergence of Rooney, Eimear McBride, Lisa McInerney, Nicole Flattery and others, Ireland has been held up for its almost mythic ability to cultivate brilliant women writers – but Dolan puts this down to Ireland being a more egalitarian playing field than the UK. “Ireland isn’t perfect, but we still have relatively good support for the arts so literary writing doesn’t have as much of a bourgeois connotation as it does in the UK. We have a better range of writers here. UK journalists always ask the oddest questions, like, ‘have you had a job before?’ I’m a normal person – yes I have.”Dolan stopped travelling by plane in September, after the fires in the Amazon moved her to reconsider her impact on the environment. “It might hold me back from promoting the book, but to be pumping all that CO2 into the air to push a novel just seems like such a ridiculous thing. If my novel doesn’t get promoted, someone else’s will. The literary world will be much unaffected.” Her decision, she thinks, comes back to her feelings about being a novelist. “I don’t think that I’m a special person who has an innate entitlement to exist writing novels while demanding other people do less pleasant things with their time. I’m lucky to, but there are a lot of things that I’m not willing to do to keep that situation going. Flying is just one of them.” Sian Cain• Naoise Dolan’s Exciting Times is published by Orion in the UK in April.“The thing I write best,” Hassan Blasim says, “is violence.” His acclaimed short-story collections, The Madman of Freedom Square and The Iraqi Christ, are fervent, unblinking depictions of post-invasion Iraq, the country of his birth, though their violence is focused through the lenses of surrealism, humour and poignancy. The former was longlisted for the Independent foreign fiction prize in 2010, and the latter won it in 2014, becoming the first title translated from Arabic to do so.In 2000, Blasim left Iraq, where he had been persecuted for his film-making and where his writing is still banned. He spent four years walking illegally across Europe, eventually settling in Finland. His debut novel, God 99 (translated by Jonathan Wright and published in July by Comma), draws on his experience: its protagonist (called Hassan) is an Iraqi refugee attempting to establish himself as a writer in Finland. But he stresses that “the book puts reality and fiction in dialogue. Autobiography is a fiction – we lie about things we misremember and misrepresent. So too fiction has truths. Luckily, I’m not famous enough for people to know my life, so I can still play with it.”God 99, he says, is “born of dialogue – always in conversation are death and life, war and peace”. In the novel, Hassan traverses Europe and interviews 99 refugees, examining the effect of war on their lives, and their impact on the countries they make home.Blasim is ambivalent about the label “European writer” – more ambivalent than he is about “debut novelist”, which he flatly rejects (“I just write. This shift to long-form is not important”). In his mind, his identity is simply “writer”. “In England,” he says, “and other parts of western and southern Europe, you have a history with immigrants. In Finland, it’s relatively new, and while some people embrace me as a Finnish writer, others resist.” Because he writes in Arabic, he is ineligible for Finnish literary prizes, and cannot join the Union of Writers.This context, combined with censorship of his work in the Middle East, means translation into English has been vital. But although Blasim attributes his success to translation, he stresses that it was never something he sought: “When I came to Europe, I didn’t know where to go. I had this romantic idea of reaching France, because of the literature. But you just go wherever you can. How can you think about the future, when life is like this? How can you think about succeeding as a writer? About reaching English-language readers?”Translating Blasim’s work – which is as experimental linguistically as it is formally – is no light task. The Arabic of God 99 is what Blasim calls “street Arabic”, and it’s another reason he’s reviled by some in Iraq: “They call me a ‘dirty writer’ – they say that I do not respect the language. Nobody can touch classical Arabic because it is a holy language. But nobody uses holy language on the street. And when I dream it is not in classical Arabic.”Does he still feel at risk? “Of course,” he says. He has returned to Iraq only once, secretly, and does not believe he will again. But his new home in Finland is not one of undiluted Scandinavian peace he is working on a project about the Finnish far right, and confides that he fears for his safety if he publishes it. “Maybe I’ll meet you in England, a refugee again,” he says. “As a refugee, you are always between two fires. Your first home, and your new one.” Will Forrester• Hassan Blasim’s God 99, translated by Jonathan Wright, will be published by Comma Press in July.A Russian writer of Armenian origin, Narine Abgaryan is already renowned as a children’s author and blogger in Russia. Her novel Three Apples Fell from the Sky has sold more than 160,000 copies since it was first published in 2015 and won Russia’s most prestigious literary award, the Yasnaya Polyana prize (founded by the Tolstoy estate). A magical realist story of friendship and feuds, published in English this month by Oneworld, the book is set in the remote Armenian mountain village of Maran, where the villagers pick mulberries and make baklava. An ancient telegraph wire and a perilous mountain path that even goats struggle to follow is their only connection to the outside world. Abgaryan cites One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez, set in the isolated fictional village of Macondo, as her favourite book. But she was haunted by the ending of Márquez’s multi-generational saga of the Buendía family, as all traces of Macondo’s existence are wiped away. In Three Apples Fell from the Sky (translated by Lisa C Hayden), she resolved to write a fable that did exactly the opposite. “I wanted to write a story that ends on a note of hope,” she says. “Humanity is in dire need of hope, of kind stories.”“We live such fast-paced lives, barely managing to speak to one another, to ask how things are going,” she says. “The thing that bothers me is how young people are leaving their elders behind.” Abgaryan, who now lives in Moscow, points to how the villagers in her novel spend their days “cultivating wine that nobody wants or needs”. “Globalisation has benefits, of course, but also negative side-effects, when national customs, the things which define people, are taken away.”Her work has already been translated into 12 languages, and with English being the 13th, she now calls this her lucky number. “When you’re published in English there’s a greater chance that your work will resonate more widely,” she says. “When your work is translated, you start to work with greater joy and hope. You start to believe in yourself more.” Jade Cuttle• Narine Abgaryan’s Three Apples Fell from the Sky, translated by Lisa C Hayden, is published by Oneworld and is out now.Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s first novel took the French literary world by surprise. She wrote it to get the story out of her head and then stuck it in a drawer. “I didn’t expect anyone would want to publish it.” A few months later, with her 30th birthday approaching, she decided she had nothing to lose by posting the manuscript to a few French publishers. “I told myself I would get a load of rejection letters and then I could stop dreaming and get on with my life.” When publishers began calling the following week, “I thought someone was playing a joke”. Delabroy-Allard eventually chose Les Éditions de Minuit, whose catalogue includes the writers she most admires, including Annie Ernaux and Marguerite Duras. “I signed the contract on my 30th birthday. That was a real party.”Ça raconte Sarah (All About Sarah) won a literary award even before it was published in 2018 to almost unanimous praise. The book was shortlisted for a the Prix Goncourt, the most prestigious literary award in France. Translated into English by Adriana Hunter and published this month by Harvill Secker, it is a story of desire and desolation. Its narrator is a bored secondary school teacher and single mother in Paris whose comfortable but humdrum life is upended when she falls in love with Sarah, a professional musician, who is loud and impetuous.The narrator and Sarah embark on an all-consuming, passionate relationship. The first part of the novel concludes when they separate and Sarah reveals she has breast cancer. In the second part, the narrator flees Sarah’s apartment, telling nobody and leaving her child behind. It is unclear whether Sarah has died or dumped the unnamed narrator, who descends into despair.Like the book’s narrator, Delabroy-Allard is a teacher, has a daughter and is in a relationship with a professional violinist called Sarah. But that is where the similarities end, she insists. “I’m not bothered if people think it’s me, but it isn’t. I find it difficult to invent things from nothing, so I use reality as a base. Once I have that base I can create the rest.”She says she left Paris to live in isolation in the countryside to complete the second part of the novel. “It was very hard being in her head – almost physically painful. I was happy to finish it.” She is now working on a second novel that she is racing to complete before she and her pregnant partner have a baby in July. The 31-year-old says she wanted to write about a passionate relationship between two women because there are so few “lesbian novels”. “But really this is a portrait of one woman, because everything we know of Sarah is through the narrator and in the second part there is no Sarah.”The novel ends leaving readers in limbo. “Several editors wanted me to rewrite it, but I didn’t want to change it. Everyone is free to imagine their own ending.” Kim Willsher• Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s All About Sarah, translated by Adriana Hunter, is published by Harvill Secker on 12 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2fce8a74b02475e1ff7977eba1a007894be782/1172_492_3966_2380/master/3966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e6c8e706a5bfd967b428b323949740d","title":"how repellent to damn minorities for not having the right politics","story":"The paradox of emancipation for the left is that the more victories it wins the less relevant it becomes. In theory, it should bank the victories and move on to the serious business it said it always wanted to concentrate on once it had swept aside irrational prejudices. In practice, it unwittingly shows that prejudice can flourish as easily on the left as the right.The presence of so many politicians of south Asian heritage in the front rank of Conservative politics, for instance, is a victory for anti-racism: proof that the party of Enoch Powell has changed beyond measure. You should be able to hold that thought in your head while acknowledging that Rishi Sunak is Boris Johnson’s useful idiot, and Priti Patel has more allegations stacking up against her than the top 10 on the FBI’s most wanted list.As with ethnicity, so with sexuality. “The aim of the LGBT+ movement is to abolish the need for an LGBT+ movement,” says the veteran activist Peter Tatchell. In other words, if it succeeds in minimising homophobia, there is no need for it. In the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher’s government passed homophobic laws, a gay man or lesbian could be conservative in their views on the economy, and in their respect for tradition and fear of socialism, but unable to vote for a party that seemed to hate them. Remove the hatred, as Tatchell had a hand in doing, turn the Conservatives into the party that legislated for gay marriage, and they should be free to regard their sexuality as politically irrelevant. That was the point.Except it has turned out not to be the point. Once caught in a cause championed by the left, you can never be free. That Pete Buttigieg could run as the first openly gay major candidate for the US presidency was not an advance if you believe the organisers of Queers against Pete. He was married and had had a conventionally successful career and conventionally establishment politics. This made him “an old politician in a young man’s body, a straight politician in a gay man’s body”, according to the New Yorker’s Masha Geeson. The only way he could be truly gay and, I guess, truly young was by fighting police violence, incarceration, unaffordable healthcare, homelessness, deportations and economic inequality.Freedom from homophobia turns out to be a demand that you commit yourself to a leftwing programme. Far from abolishing itself when its necessarily limited aims are met, an emancipatory movement acquires the permanence of a religion, and excommunication awaits those who fail to adhere to its dogmas. Asian Conservative politicians, meanwhile, are experiencing what liberal Muslims fighting Islamists have experienced for years. They’re “coconuts” – brown on the outside, white on the inside, in case the point of the slur escaped you – “native informants” working for the white colonial authorities when their racial destiny was to uphold the party line that all Tories are racists. Once again, freedom from prejudice comes with a hefty bill. The struggle against racism does not leave you free to be a Tory, if you choose. It confines you.Nor is there anything new in the outraged cries of “after all I have done for you”. Arguments that the working class betrayed itself are as old as the socialist movement. “They were the enemy,” the hero of Robert Tressell’s The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists cried at apathetic working men in 1914. They not only “submitted like so many cattle to the existing state of things, but defended it, and opposed and ridiculed any suggestion to alter it”. In the mid-20th century, leftish feminists had to come to terms with the fact that Labour would have won more elections if women had not been given the vote. But when all the excuses have been made the consequences remain repellent.Movements no more own their supporters than husbands own wives. Once made, accusations of betrayal make reconciliation impossible. No one damned as a coconut or a straight man in a gay man’s body forgives the presumption of the insult, not least because it echoes the hatreds of reactionaries. The rightwing US shock jock Rush Limbaugh said a gay man could not be a presidential contender because “America’s still not ready to elect a gay guy kissing his husband”. Buttigieg’s leftwing opponents said he should not be the Democratic candidate because he was the wrong type of gay.The attacks on the Tory descendants of east African Asians echo the attacks of white racists. Their ancestry remains their curse. They are no longer from refugee families, who were robbed of everything they owned by Idi Amin and the other African dictators of the 1970s but the tainted descendants of the British empire’s “subcolonial agents” in Africa. Who could be surprised that their bad blood turned them Tory?Across the west, the centre- and radical left are suffering endless defeats. I wait for the moment when their supporters ask what they are doing wrong. One item on a long list would be the notion that the left owns minorities. As morality, it is an affront to inidual liberty. As strategy, it is worse than useless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c244465b20f5b1f4956e77744071772f52b56d22/0_315_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a423f768e2d06f0c9f2fb81d9d46b7","title":"if you dont like the pussycat olls or lizzo you can always look away","story":"Sometimes it seems the sexistageistsizeist female Venn diagram of popular music will always be with us. The reformed Pussycat Dolls have been criticised for their “raunchy” dance routines (“little better than a strip act”). Elsewhere, rapper Lizzo complained about the social media platform TikTok censoring images of her in a bathing suit. TikTok says it objected to images of “sexual gratification” (Lizzo in her underwear), while she insists it was sizeism.Recently, Jennifer Lopez was triple-slammed for a Super Bowl pole-dancing performance – obviously relating to her role in the film Hustlers – first, for being overtly sexual second, for being overtly sexual as a 50-year-old (no, Jenny, no!) third, for making similarly aged women feel bad about their bodies. Not to forget Madonna – who always attracts turbo-strength ageism-cum-misogyny for her “over-sexytoo young” stage costumes, as though she should consider performing in hair rollers and a housecoat.What is it about successful female artists doing their thing, on stage or on social media, that drives certain sectors of society crazy? And why is the sexism so often merged with ageism or sizeism, as if that makes the abuse they’re meting out extra special and justified?Admittedly, one of the Pussycat Dolls’ performances was on breakfast television – but can’t people switch off, or over, without first activating the righteous-offence alarm? “Officer, women are wriggling suggestively on my TV screen, and the remote control is at least 3ft away on the kitchen table. Send help!” There’s always a choice. People are invited to enjoy what musicians are doing, listen to the songs, buy tickets, watch videos, but they’re also entitled to look away and say: “No thanks.”Of course there are many more examples (and levels) of sexism in the music industry, and all the artists I’ve mentioned bring much more than visuals. However, it’s interesting how berating women for being eye-catching and entertaining has almost become part of the pop-cultural consumer experience. It’s noteworthy how frequently we hear a variation of “Put it away, love!” aimed at accomplished female stars. When, by definition, they should not be putting anything away, because, if they’re not expressing themselves fully, what exactly is the point?Ultimately, objecting to an artist “bringing the visuals” is as nonsensical as objecting to other artists not bringing them enough – as in, how come Neil Young still gets to shamble on stage in jeans that look as though he’s been wearing them since 1979?Do some men still think of women as little more than sexual spittoons?In fairness, Clinton also says he feels regret and guilt about how it defined Lewinsky’s life. Nevertheless, his comments are grotesque and bizarre, as is the fact he’s happy to make them.The cliche is that men exchange love in return for sex, while women exchange sex for love, but, in reality, women are just as capable of adopting a more casual attitude to sex, of viewing it as recreational or a sport.None of this offends or terrifies women (sorry to disappoint some men). What angers women (well, anyone) is lack of honesty, respect and information – someone not being entirely straight with them about the kind of sex they’re having. This is what makes women feel like a masturbation aid, rather than an actual human being. This is how people end up feeling used and duped – not just exploited and humiliated sexually, but also emotionally.It amounts to sexual fraud. Lewinsky, a young intern at the time, had sex with Clinton because she was in love with him – if he had made it clear that she was mere stress relief, would she have bothered? The answer to that question is irrelevant. It only matters that Clinton didn’t give Lewinsky the chance to make an informed decision.Lewinsky was and is a human being, not the carnal equivalent of a round of golf for a high-status alpha. Clinton is right about one thing – she did deserve better.According to new research from Mintel, Britons will be spending more than £4bn on grabbing a coffee this year. Sales are up £1bn since 2015, and people are now getting their caffeine fix not just from coffee shops, but also in McDonald’s, or cafes in supermarkets or stores.Tea, while lagging behind coffee, is also enjoying a resurgence, with, tellingly, the most popular choice being builder’s tea – which, of course, is very strong English breakfast tea, no other definitions accepted, or even considered.I say “tellingly”, because you have to smile at how such developments are presented as fluctuations and surges in lifestyle choices. As if British people still harbour wistful delusions about emulating the cast of Friends, hanging out in groovy friendship groups, yakking about their lives, in ersatz versions of Central Perk incidentally, the most unrealistic coffee shop of all time because that big squishy seating area was always mysteriously free.Does this convivial, enriching coffee shop reverie hold any truth for the UK, or is it just a fantasy of coffee and tea purveyors?

Emma Cook unpacks the rich inner life of the ultimate accessoryI am running along the river, earbuds in, lungs burning, heart racing. No birdsong, thank you very much. Only curated noise and introspection. Then I see her. A woman walking towards me, her dog a little way ahead. We smile, briefly, and as we cross one another she pauses for a moment. I do, too, my eyes caught. The way it dangles from her shoulder, the double gold chain glinting in the sunlight. It is exactly like the one I have at home and yet… so not. Reflexively she flicks her bag back and it grazes her hip. I slow to a walk to get a better look. This version is newer and smaller. So much smaller than mine. It is shinier, too, infinitely covetable. Undeniably superior in every way. It speaks of lightness, of newfound freedom, of being out in the morning sunshine with few possessions (I calculate there’s no room in there for more than an iPhone and keys) except, of course, the possession itself. In comparison, my older and bigger version is grounded at home, bloated, out of time, a lumbering dinosaur. Old bag.How could I have got it so wrong? I speed up again, start to run in sync with my shuffle, but the moment has gone. The dark pull of material desire has intruded again. I try to switch off, but it is difficult not to notice. A tote here. A micro bag there. A crossbody bag everywhere. Handbag envy. Often it is admiration, sometimes, if I’m honest, there is pity. Michael Kors, Kurt Geiger. Really? But how swiftly admiration turns to envy when there is flawless gold hardware involved. Can I really be this shallow? Do I even need to ask? Lusting after something like this makes you a fool. An unfeminist fool.Last week in a toy shop with my eight-year-old daughter I saw a “My First Handbag for two-year-olds and up”. The packaging proclaimed, “Little ones will love taking this pretty pink handbag on a shopping trip and pretending to be just like Mum! Take a peek in the mirror and chat on the phone. Playing pretend will boost your child’s imagination and encourage them to talk and learn new words.” Like: “Mummy, buy me a Gucci!” But obsession is never this simple. I suspect my interest in handbags was more a small act of rebellion than social conditioning, a reaction against my mother’s infinitely sensible handbag choices: natural leather, functional, unembellished. Her modest choice of accessory was far more successful in fuelling my false need than any marketing campaign.But it took until my 50th birthday to really follow through and invest in the Only One. It is blingtastic. Italian. Intimate blush suede concealed beneath tooled black leather and, oh, the inimitable clunk of an expensive gold clasp as it snaps open and shut. Je ne regrette rien.I may look and yearn but, when I commit, it’s for life. It has to be for the price I paid. My husband is still appalled it will always be a purchase that baffles him. He likes to remind me that my bag cost more than his beloved bike (surely the Gucci of bikes, with a custom-steel Italian Dedacciai frame, he tells me) that gets him to work each day – as if this is a clear win in the battle for most functional possession.I explain, slowly and patiently, that mine is not just a thing of beauty, but a practical form of transportation, too, for my possessions my way of navigating the world and getting what matters most to me from A to B.You see, to truly appreciate a handbag, you have to look beyond its surface, challenging though this can be, to what’s inside and how that shapes and defines you.It is reassuring to see that the argument I hone for my husband is now the focus of a V\u0026ampA exhibition next month. Bags: Inside Out, from Margaret Thatcher’s Asprey to Carrie Bradshaw’s Fendi, will look at what we have chosen to carry with us down the centuries. “We normally see bags when they’re closed, but I want to see the insides,” says exhibition curator Dr Lucia Savi. While much attention is paid to the exterior – its design, status and, inevitably, its price tag, less scrutiny is paid to this rich and complex internal life and the tension between the two. “It’s only when you leave home that you decide what is important to you – those things you choose to carry with you define you,” she says.When a woman stepped out in the 1740s, her private belongings would have included a watch, a snuff box, money, jewellery and perhaps some food, according to Savi. These are what she chose to take from her domestic sphere into the world thanks to detachable pockets that were tied around the waist, accessible through openings in the seams of petticoats.By 1863, she may have included scissors, a purse, a thimble, a miniature notebook and a magnifying glass. These she would have worn in the form of a chatelaine: a series of small purses that were suspended from the waist and highly visible. “It was symbolic of status,” says Savi. “Along with that there were reports of pickpockets who would cut the ribbons and steal them. It’s the first signs we see of the attention paid to women carrying belongings.”What many women carry in their bags some three centuries later is remarkably unchanged. One friend lists the contents of her bag at this moment as: “A book, cosmetics, phone, keys, reading glasses, spare contact lenses and eye drops, ‘emergency’ vegan kit (banana, vitamin supplements and, sometimes, a small vial of soya milk), paracetamol, umbrella, purse, stamps, bank and membership cards, miniature sewing kit andor lingerie tape, spare tightssocks, perfume.”“The content is so crucial,” says Savi. “As bank notes came in, handbags had to be compatible, at least bigger than a £5 note.” Now we carry cards, it is the phone that dictates design. “No one will create a bag that doesn’t fit the largest phone on the market.” Hard currency has shaped bags more than any other single possession, epitomised in 2018 by the appearance of the micro bag. There was no more potent symbol of a cashless society than the shrinking bag, although Savi is unconvinced by this connection. “It’s nothing new. The frog purse, dating back to the 1600s and intricately made in silk and glass beads, is the same size as your hand. It’s really the micro bag of today.”More surprising, she says, is how the most ordinary of bags can communicate something about us. “It’s a blank canvas that can tell us all sorts of things: your status, your beliefs.” One of her favourite pieces on show is an “anti-slavery reticule” produced in 1825 by the Female Society for Birmingham. It is white silk with an image of a black woman breastfeeding while still a slave – displayed on a bag it was a powerful and very public way for a woman to convey her political beliefs at that time. “That tells you so much how women were proclaiming their beliefs and it carries on with examples like Anya Hindmarch’s I Am Not A Plastic Bag.”Savi is keen that the exhibition embraces bags in all their glory, not just the female handbag. Which is why Churchill’s despatch box is on show, as well as other bags used by men. Baggage began with men, says Savi, and was mainly for the train. “Louis Vuitton started with luxury travel, transferring their leather-making skills from horses to trains and then aeroplanes. Hermès started with saddlery and they still use those techniques in their stitching.”Now we’re going full circle. According to Mintel, a quarter of men aged 16-24 buy manbags. But even if the manbag achieves parity, it is difficult to imagine it will be quite as iconic, as rich in metaphor, as its female equivalent. Will the tension between public and private space, that Savi explores, ever apply to men in quite the same way?As Dr Alison Bancroft, fashion theorist and author of Fashion and Psychoanalysis, says: “The very fact that we have to prefix it with ‘man’ means it’s not the same. It is something different.” She tells me how a male friend of hers recently asked for a paracetamol and when she told him it was in her handbag, he wouldn’t look inside. “Instead he brought the whole bag to me. The handbag is about a degree of intimacy not everyone feels comfortable with.”A handbag can establish boundaries and respect, but the flip side is less savoury. Bancroft recalls seeing the aftermath of a mugging in her local park and the remnants of an emptied handbag on the path. “That’s when you see it as a real violation, an act of violence against a person.”I think back to the fleeting, primal panic, when my brain calibrates an absence, a lack of weight in what I’m carrying – I have left my handbag somewhere. In those moments I feel unmoored, as if I have lost part of myself. As Bancroft says: “How many times have you heard a woman say, ‘It is part of me. My life is in there?’” Maybe that is too much power to invest in a single object. Wouldn’t we feel freer relying on pockets, or just carrying less? But then Savi tells me about another highlight in the exhibition – a beautiful, battered Louis Vuitton trunk from the 1900s that belonged to Emilie Busbey Grigsby, an American socialite. Her trunk was a symbol of freedom, covered in travel labels of the places she, and it, had spent a lifetime visiting.A bag can be whatever you want it to be. It can offer the promise of a sleek, well-ordered better version of yourself, a superior mini-you or, like Emilie, a wonderful souvenir of your travels. As my friend, who never knowingly underpacks, says: “A bag isn’t a burden but rather a ticket to ride.”Bags: Inside Out, sponsored by Mulberry, is at the V\u0026ampA, 25 April-31 January.

Director Nick Rowland adapted the film from a short story by County Mayo writer Colin Barrett, and when it toured the festival circuit, many critics labelled it an extraordinary debut for the film-maker and a breakout performance for Jarvis, who plays Arm, a former boxer turned gangland enforcer, with heartbreaking complexity.Arm works at the behest of nasty small‑town crooks on the west coast of Ireland. In private, they refer to him as “the halfwit”, and on screen, he is a hulking presence, looming tall and wide over the men unfortunate enough to cross his path. Jarvis had to bulk up to play him. “Luckily they just wanted it to look like he was once in shape,” he says. He ate a lot, drank milkshakes and lifted weights to get the presence he needed. Arm is as naive as he is vicious, and a slow-moving, lumbering menace, while Jarvis is febrile and fidgety, vibrating with a quicker energy. You suspect he would rather not sit still if he could help it.This is apt, considering the shape of his career. Now 30, he started out making no-budget films with his mates when he was a teenager in Devon, while also plying his trade as a musician, putting his folk-ish songs on MySpace and releasing five albums. Eventually, he put the music on hold to focus on acting. In 2016, he appeared in William Oldroyd’s masterful Lady Macbeth alongside Florence Pugh, playing Sebastian, the brooding workman with whom Pugh’s Katherine has a macabre and doomed affair.He considers that he got going in 2012, when he made a film with his brother and his friends called The Naughty Room, about a 20-year-old who has been locked in the family bathroom since childhood by his abusive mother. That got him some attention. “But I didn’t really know how one got into acting properly, because I was never connected, and I quit school really early.” He met his first agent through the film. “I thought, I might as well just start knocking,” he recalls. “It was a slow burn from there. Years of nothing, and then eventually getting a few little jobs, TV jobs, and keep on chipping away.”Jarvis was born in the US, in New Jersey, to an Armenian-American mother and an English father. They moved to Plymouth when he was a baby, and eventually, he says, “worked up the train tracks”, landing in and around Totnes. “Me and my brother had a lot of independence as youngsters. Not like, you know, the bashing up old ladies kind, but just…” He fades out. He is still very close to his younger brother (“though he hates it when I call him younger”), who also works in film, in the art department.In Calm With Horses, he plays an Irishman amid an almost entirely Irish cast, including Barry Keoghan (Dunkirk and The Killing of a Sacred Deer), who plays Arm’s best friend and handler Dympna. Jarvis stayed in accent from the second he arrived in the country. “We were staying in places with local populations who didn’t really give a shit about the film. You’d just be down the pub, and you’d chat with anybody, so all of the resources that I needed were there.” He pulled it off so convincingly that Niamh Algar, who plays his ex-girlfriend Ursula, was surprised to get a voice message from him in his own English accent. “It was the only way I knew how to do it,” he says. “With film, you come in, you blow everything you’ve got, and it’s a short amount of time. You’re getting a good wage to do a creative craft, so you might as well just go all the way out.”The film is as bloody as it is beautiful. Was the violence of it in any way familiar to him? “I mean, not at that level,” he says. “I’ve never smashed someone through a coffee table. I used to box at school. Got suspended for it a couple of times.” He was suspended for other stuff as well, he says, but that’s not why he left school early. “Oh no. I just wasn’t learning anything, and at the time I was working as a musician, so I chose to start working then, on the road, then trying to tour with my band.”Despite some success - his 2011 single Gay Pirates was a cult hit, and has more than 2m views on YouTube – he says he has finished with music for now. “If I’m going to try and get any sort of credibility as an actor, I don’t want to have a foot dipping in anything else. It was quite good to leave all that behind, because I think music sort of... nearly killed me.” Did it really? “Sort of, sort of,” he smiles. He doesn’t want to sound bitter, he says. “It was just a young man’s game.”When it comes to making his way in the acting world, Jarvis seems too candid to be much of a schmoozer. “Unfortunately, a lot of the time, it is to do with networking and knowing people and presentation and all of that,” he says. Is he any good at it? He smiles. “Not really, no. I still get baffled by the smoke and mirrors stuff, but I totally understand why it’s there, and I’m not going to try and go against any grain, because there’s no point. I’m 30 now.”His agent also told him that he was not allowed to “artist myself to death”, as he puts it. So while he’s starring in a number of buzzy independent films – it’s hard to look at the lineup for a film festival without seeing him attached to at least one entry – he’s also appearing in Raised By Wolves, HBO’s new sci-fi show, executive-produced by Ridley Scott, about which he can tell me absolutely nothing. He seems content to not sit still. “There will probably come a time where I have to get a house or pay for a kid,” he reasons, “but at the minute, I’m really happy with what I’ve done, so far.”Calm With Horses is in cinemas on Friday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3e25af530a738cf91ac8a45950a9a5166bf9d9/0_854_3475_2085/master/3475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bc5553edba9049f7afab5771c6cbf88","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe polenta balsamic radicchio mushrooms","story":"A well-balanced dish of soft polenta, bitter leaves, sweet agave and tart balsamic all rounded out by earthy mushroomsRadicchio, in its many varieties and hues of pink, is nature’s most outrageous flirt.The castelfranco is big and blowsy, like a giant rose that’s almost too good to eat. The trevisano is torpedo-shaped, contained and very secretive. The most commonly available here, chioggia, looks like red cabbage except for its white veins like snow-covered trees. And taro has tendrils like Medusa’s hair that stay robust and firm when cooked. Whichever type you find (and you can use any in this dish), they all have a very special bitterness that makes them a perfect partner for sweet-and-sour balsamic vinegar and the earthy richness of mushrooms and polenta.Once, these special leaves were the preserve of upmarket Italian restaurants only, but these days they make regular cameos in farmers’ markets and even some supermarkets. If you can’t find them, use red ene (chicory) instead, but because bitterness varies between the different breeds, so add the agave syrup to taste.1 litre vegetable stock180g instant polentaFine sea saltOlive oil, for cooking1 large head radicchio taro (around 500g), cut into 1cm shredsBalsamic vinegar2 tbsp agave syrup (or to taste)1 tbsp lemon juice12 sage leaves500g chestnut mushrooms, sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled and mincedExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishPut the stock in a saucepan for which you have a lid and bring it to a rolling boil. Pour in the polenta in a thin, steady stream, whisking as you do so, then keep whisking for another minute. The polenta will quickly thicken to a paste, and the moment it starts bubbling like molten lava, turn off the heat (if you let it bubble too much, it will get too thick). Stir in half a teaspoon of salt and cover the pan with the lid.Heat three tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan and, once it’s hot, add the shredded radicchio. At first it will look like it will never wilt, but six minutes later, the radicchio will be soft and tender. Add two and a half tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, agave syrup to taste, lemon juice and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Cook for another two minutes, transfer the radicchio and all the pan juices to a bowl, then wipe out the pan.Line a small plate with a couple of pieces of kitchen paper(or a clean cloth). Heat three tablespoons of oil in the same pan over a medium-high heat and, when hot, add the sage leaves. Cook until the sage crisps up in the pan (around three minutes), then transfer with a slotted spoon to the paper-lined plate to drain. Add half the mushrooms and garlic to the hot oil, cook for about 10 minutes, until the mushrooms are bronzed, then tip into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms and garlic. Return the first batch to the pan, then add a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt.Ahead of serving, stir the polenta to check the consistency – it should be like thick custard – if not, boil the kettle and add just enough hot water to loosen it. To serve, portion the polenta on to plates, flatten with the back of a spoon, then top first with some radicchio and then some mushrooms and crisp sage.

It’s impossible to deny the differences between the continent’s various cuisines, true, but you also can’t ignore its common spirit, which here in Britain is evident wherever you look. We may have left the EU six weeks ago, but we are still proudly (and greedily) European.This may sound an unlikely combination, but nutty tahini brings rich creaminess to crisp schnitzel. The same treatment also works with pork chops, but adjust cooking times accordingly. Serve with a green salad or a more traditional potato salad, if you prefer.Prep 15 minCook 50 minServes 4 as a main2 shallots, peeled and sliced into very thin rounds (90g net weight) 1 tbsp lemon juiceSalt and black pepper2 large eggs80g good-quality tahini2 tbsp dijon mustard130g panko breadcrumbs50g sesame seeds50g plain flour4 large skinless chicken breasts (680g net weight)300ml sunflower oil, for fryingFor the dressing60g good-quality tahini2 tbsp lemon juice1½ tbsp dijon mustard1 garlic clovtahini e, peeled and crushed2-3 tbsp parsley leaves, finely choppedHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Put the shallot, lemon juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a small bowl, toss to combine, then leave to soften while you make the rest of the dish. Whisk all the dressing ingredients in a small bowl with 50ml water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, until smooth.Whisk the eggs, tahini, mustard, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of water in a shallow container (or on a plate with a lip). In a separate container (or plate), mix the panko, sesame and a teaspoon of salt. Put the flour on a third plate.Lay the chicken breasts on a board and, using a meat mallet (or the base of a heavy saucepan), lightly bash them, until they are about 1½cm thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, then, one by one, coat the breasts in the flour and shake off any excess. Dredge them one by one in the egg mixture, then coat in the breadcrumb mixture. Put the oil in a saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry one chicken breast for about two minutes on each side, until golden, then transfer to a rack set on an oven tray (the rack ensures the bottom of the schnitzels won’t go soggy in the oven). Repeat with the remaining chicken, one breast at a time, then bake for seven minutes, or until cooked through.Cut each schnitzel widthways into 2cm-wide strips, then use the knife to transfer each breast neatly to a large platter. Scatter the shallots on top, drizzle on half the dressing and serve with the rest alongside.This German bread dumpling gets its name from the way it’s traditionally shaped and cooked in kitchen cloth (serviette). It’s like a savoury bread pudding and would make a great side for a Sunday roast with lots of gravy. Get ahead by cooking the dumpling the day before and leaving it to set in the fridge, ready to be sliced and fried the next day.1 large baguette, crust removed and cut into roughly 1½-2 cm cubes (340g net weight) 500ml whole milk 70g unsalted butter 3 large eggs3 onions, peeled and each sliced into 5 rounds (450g net)4 garlic cloves, peeled3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasingSalt and black pepper20g parsley leaves, roughly chopped20g chives, sliced into 1½cm lengths, plus 1 tbsp extra, finely chopped, to serve1 generous grating nutmeg1 lemon – zest grated, to get 1½ tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp 120g soured cream, to serve (optional)Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Spread out the bread on an oven tray lined with baking paper and toast in the oven for eight minutes, to dry out but not colour. Leave to cool a little, then transfer to a large bowl.Put the milk and 50g butter in a medium saucepan on a medium heat and leave until the butter has melted and the milk is steaming. Whisk the eggs in a large, heatproof bowl, then very slowly pour in the hot milk, whisking continuously. Pour this over the bread cubes and leave to soak for 30 minutes, stirring every now and then – the bread will soften and absorb lots of liquid.Put a well-greased griddle pan on a high heat. In a bowl, gently toss the onion rounds and garlic with a tablespoon and a half of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Once the pan is hot, grill the onion rounds in two or three batches for about five minutes on each side, until well charred and softened. Remove the onions, then griddle the garlic for two to three minutes, until well charred. Finely chop all the garlic and half the onion, and add to the bread bowl with the herbs, nutmeg, lemon zest, a teaspoon of salt and lots of pepper.Cut out three pieces of foil roughly 40cm x 30cm in size, and cut out one piece of baking paper of similar size. Top the paper with the bread mixture and use the paper to roll and shape it into a roughly 22cm-long x 9cm-diameter cylinder. Wrap in a piece of foil, twisting the ends to seal it tightly, then repeat twice more with the remaining foil sheets, so the parcel is as compact as possible.Fill a large, 28cm, cast-iron saucepan for which you have a lid with water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, then lay in the dumpling cylinder seam side up – it won’t be completely submerged. Cover the pan with the lid and leave to cook for an hour.Use tongs to lift the dumpling from the pan and, when it’s cool enough to handle, gently unwrap the foil and paper. Leave to set for 30 minutes, or longer, if time allows (the longer it’s left, the easier it will be to slice), then use a serrated knife to cut it into 2cm-thick slices – you should end up with 10.Melt 10g butter and half a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Once hot, sear a third of the dumpling slices for two minutes a side, or until nicely browned. Repeat with the remaining slices, using up the last of the butter and oil as you go.Gently toss the reserved grilled onion with the lemon juice, extra chives and a pinch of salt, and put on a large platter. Arrange the dumpling slices alongside and serve with soured cream, if using.This makes more crumble than you need: save the excess for sprinkling on yoghurt or ice-cream. All the dish’s different components can be made up to a day ahead. And if you really want to save time, used just crushed Biscoffs instead of making the crumble.2 x 410g tins sliced peaches in juice, drained (500g net)1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get 1 tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp 1 tbsp caster sugar1 tbsp thyme leavesFor the custard700ml whole milk100g piece fresh ginger, skin-on and thinly sliced1 vanilla pod, split in half lengthways and seeds scraped out5 large egg yolks55g caster sugarFor the crumble50g plain flour45g unsalted butter, fridge-cold, and cut into 1½ cm cubes30g caster sugar½ tsp ground cinnamon40g Lotus Biscoff biscuits, blitzed or crushed by hand into a coarse crumble1 pinch flaked sea saltFirst make the custard. Put the milk, ginger and vanilla pod and seeds in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid. Bring to a gentle simmer on a medium heat, pressing down on the solids to extract as much flavour as possible, then turn off the heat, cover and leave to infuse for at least an hour (if you’re getting ahead, now refrigerate overnight). Strain into a second pan, discard the solids and bring back to a simmer on a medium heat.Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until smooth. Pour in the warm milk in a slow, steady stream, whisking, until everything is combined and the bowl is warm to the touch. Pour the lot back into the pan, put on a medium heat and cook, stirring continuously, for about 15 minutes, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl, cover the surface of the custard with clingfilm and refrigerate until ready to use (you want it fridge-cold).In a bowl, mix the peaches, lemon zest and juice, and sugar, and refrigerate (again, so it’s fridge-cold).Heat the oven to 170C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. For the crumble, put the flour in a large bowl and, with your fingers, rub in the butter until the mix resembles coarse crumbs. Add the sugar, cinnamon, crushed biscuits and flaked salt, toss to mix, then spread out on a medium oven tray lined with baking paper. Bake for 18 minutes, stirring once halfway, or until nicely browned, then set aside to cool and crisp up further.Divide the custard between four shallow glass bowls. Top with the peaches and their liquid, followed by a generous spoonful of crumble and some thyme leaves. Serve with extra crumble in a bowl on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2816fc521c16dae3be15bbb4acb8c58a74efe404/794_288_3230_1938/master/3230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b67dda8bfa673bcb688f0dd0abac38c2","title":"arsenal west ham premier league match report","story":"Arsenal could not afford to squander this opportunity so they will not care too much that, in giving their prospects of Champions League qualification genuine life, they committed something akin to daylight robbery. This was, from start to finish, a slog for Mikel Arteta’s side as they struggled to make their monopoly on possession pay and wobbled repeatedly when probed by an intelligent West Ham. Had Bernd Leno not burnished his status as one of the most underrated keepers around, or the visiting forwards not squandered a slew of clear openings, their claim to a top-four spot would now appear fantastical. However, the fine margins went in their favour and never more so than in the game’s deciding incident.Alexandre Lacazette had been involved only sporadically since replacing Eddie Nketiah before the hour. The tide had largely been flowing in the opposite direction but in the 78th minute he applied the kind of finish that has defined his career. When Bukayo Saka darted inside and fed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the striker’s shot was deflected by Declan Rice and looped up towards Mesut Özil, who was stationed to the right of goal. Özil’s header across to Lacazette was precise and the first-time volley equally so. The celebrations were cut short by an offside flag and nobody, not even Arteta, initially sensed much cause for complaint. “When the goal was disallowed I thought: ‘OK, that’s fine,’” he said.However, Arteta was soon informed by his staff that something was amiss and, by that point, the lines and vectors at Stockley Park had whirled into action too. Not even the most painstaking examination of toe and elbow positions could rule Özil had edged in front of Aaron Cresswell when Aubameyang struck the ball, while Lacazette had even less of a case to answer. It took several minutes but eventually Kevin Friend, the VAR official, made the right call and Arsenal’s celebrations left no doubt about the moment’s importance.For David Moyes, whose setup could not be faulted, the frustration was clear. The West Ham manager professed not to hold an opinion about the overruled decision but did not require too much pressing to hint at his distaste. “A very good referee and linesman gave the offside but someone else chose to change their mind,” he said.Less than two minutes had been played when Jarrod Bowen, seizing on a loose Granit Xhaka pass, struck the base of Leno’s right post from 20 yards. Then Pablo Marí, making his Premier League debut, missed an interception but Michail Antonio and Sébastien Haller botched a golden chance. Shortly after that Haller overran the ball when played through and just before the interval Antonio turned it wide in front of goal after Issa Diop had nodded down a corner.By the midway point Arsenal had, despite hogging the ball, made little use of it bar a Sokratis Papastathopoulos header that clipped the bar. A small improvement after the restart meant Lukasz Fabianski denied Nketiah after more good work from Saka, but Leno saved outstandingly from Antonio and Haller either side of the winner and nobody could deny Lacazette’s lethal contribution had been an outlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6558fa69b85e4313bad83ad31846033a0ea6cb11/0_14_2778_1668/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bbee7ddb54d5c28ee0d0694019f9728","title":"burnley tottenham premier league match report","story":"This is still not Tottenham as we know them, but at least the slump has been stopped. José Mourinho has never lost four games in a row before, let alone five, so he will have been pleased to see his side come back from a goal down and a shocking first-half performance to draw a line under the losing sequence, even if Burnley and their captain, Ben Mee, will be kicking themselves for letting their visitors back into the game.Mee was guilty of an uncontrolled tackle at the start of the second half that gifted Spurs a penalty and gave them a route back into a game that they never seemed likely to find for themselves. Burnley were so much on top in the first half they were probably not too worried about the number of chances they wasted, but the game changed when Spurs equalised and in the end a point apiece was a fair result. The home side missed their chance to overtake Spurs in the table and will have to console themselves with extending their unbeaten league run to seven matches.“That’s hard to do in this league,” said the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche. “We’ve found a good level of consistency in the last few weeks. We were excellent in the first half but then we made a mistake and got punished.”Mourinho claimed his half-time changes had made a crucial difference. “In the first half we didn’t have a midfield,” the Spurs manager said, before pointing the finger of blame at Tanguy Ndombele in particular. “I know adapting to the Premier League is difficult but he has had enough time and a player of his potential has to give us more than he is giving us,” he said. You could tell by the way Mourinho prefaced his remarks with “I’m not going to run away” that some sort of bombshell was about to be dropped, but at £54m Ndombele happens to be Spurs’ record signing.Steven Bergwijn’s direct running produced a chance in the opening minute for Érik Lamela, who overran the ball when it rolled free near the penalty spot just waiting to be struck. That proved to be a misleading indication of what was to come, however, for after Chris Wood had shot too high, Jay Rodriguez had hit the bar from a corner and Jack Cork had brought a save from Hugo Lloris at the other end Burnley took an early lead. A headed clearance from a Dwight McNeil cross invited a rasping volley from Rodriguez on the edge of the Spurs penalty area, Lloris saved but could not hold, and Wood scored one of his more routine goals by reaching the loose ball first.Eric Dier, playing centrally in a three-man backline, had to endure some uncomplimentary chants about his brother in the first half but was otherwise unruffled. The visitors’ main problem was that Burnley were winning most of the midfield battles and using the ball more adventurously. Lamela did break away from James Tarkowski to bring a comfortable save from Nick Pope after half an hour but it was just about the only attempt on goal Spurs had produced up to that point. Ashley Westwood volleyed wide as Burnley continued to press, before Wood went close to a second just before the interval. The tall striker was in position to meet Tarkowski’s knockdown from a Westwood free-kick but was unable to keep his shot on target when the ball reached him in front of goal. With Phil Bardsley ending the half volleying too high with an optimistic attempt Spurs could only be grateful their hosts had failed to make their first-half superiority fully count.Mourinho sent on Lucas Moura and Giovani Lo Celso for the second half, which had barely got under way when Spurs found their luck had changed. A neat Lo Celso pass invited Lamela to break into the Burnley area, so perhaps that part of the equaliser was down to Mourinho’s substitutions, though Mee’s challenge was needlessly reckless, missing the ball and catching Lamela’s foot. There were no Burnley complaints: it was a clear penalty, even if the actual contact could only have been in the area by an inch or two. Mee has a habit of leaping into tackles and looked as if he knew he had miscalculated as soon as Lamela went down. Dele Alli confidently sent Pope the wrong way from the spot and Tottenham perked up as if their afternoon had just started.Suddenly, it was Burnley being pushed back in their own half as Spurs passed and moved with a crispness that had been lacking in the first half. Alli and Moura combined to go close midway through the half before Burnley’s first notable attacking threat since the break was snuffed out by man of the moment Eric Dier, who took the ball off Matej Vydra’s toes as the substitute was about to shoot.Vydra was involved again in the closing minutes when Lloris kept him out from close range before Alli hit the side netting at the other end after a deflection. If it was not quite a performance to put Spurs supporters in good heart for the trip to Leipzig on Tuesday, it was better than another defeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4600ad05cac97c97d826ae7e9ac1e0366e5eafe/0_77_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7710871767f7510fd01b7a85589fbc","title":"european roundup lionel messi leaves it late to put barcelona top","story":"Lionel Messi kept his nerve from the penalty spot to give Barcelona a 1-0 win over Real Sociedad in La Liga to return his side to the top of the table. Barça’s all-time top scorer calmly chipped the ball into the net in the 81st minute after Sociedad defender Robin Le Normand had been penalised following a VAR review for hitting the ball with his arm as he contested a cross.The penalty was awarded at a time when Barcelona were struggling to cope with Sociedad’s flowing counterattacks, with the away side missing several chances to take the lead in a bold second-half display. Sociedad’s frustration at conceding the penalty was heightened when their former player Antoine Griezmann appeared to push over defender Nacho Monreal in the area but no foul was awarded.Barcelona looked to have scored a second goal deep in injury time when Jordi Alba slotted in a cross from substitute Ansu Fati but another VAR review determined that the teenage forward had been narrowly offside when he received the ball from Messi. The victory took Barcelona back to the top of the standings on 58 points although Real Madrid, on 56, can restore their place at the league summit by beating Real Betis.Earlier in the day, Atlético Madrid missed the chance to get back into the top four when they were held to an entertaining 2-2 draw with third-placed Sevilla following a frantic first half. Sevilla went ahead through Luuk de Jong but Atlético levelled with a penalty from Álvaro Morata after a VAR review determined that Diego Carlos had handled the ball.Atlético then took the lead with a heavily deflected shot from João Félix, only for Sevilla’s Lucas Ocampos to level from the spot right before half-time, after another VAR review decided he had been fouled by Kieran Trippier.Diego Simeone’s side went all out for a winner after the interval but were unable to get past impressive keeper Tomas Vaclik.Japanese forward Takefusa Kubo scored as Mallorca defeated Eibar 2-1 for a first away win in the league this season. Kubo, on loan from Real Madrid, scored with a low shot from outside the area after Dani Rodríguez had opened the scoring for the visitors. Eibar’s lone goal came from Pedro Bigas in injury time.In Germany, Borussia Dortmund scored once in either half, through Thorgan Hazard and Achraf Hakimi, to edge past hosts Borussia Mönchengladbach 2-1 and take over second place in the Bundesliga with their seventh win in their last eight league matches.Hazard gave the visitors the lead when he shook off three defenders, turned to create space and curled in with his left foot in the eighth minute. Gladbach struck back five minutes after the restart with a Lars Stindl tap-in but Dortmund hit back when Hakimi latched on to a Jadon Sancho through ball, raced into the box and beat keeper Yann Sommer.Earlier on, RB Leipzig played out a lacklustre 0-0 at Wolfsburg and have now dropped to third place following their second consecutive draw. Leipzig, who host Tottenham in the Champions League on Tuesday, hardly made an impact in the first half but tried their luck early in the second with shots from Yussuf Poulsen and Marcel Sabitzer. Wolfsburg hit back with two chances of their own, Max Arnold and Xaver Schlager both firing narrowly wide.Bayer Leverkusen moved into the top four on 47 points with a dominant 4-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt featuring two goals from Paulinho."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20bdfda7ecee11a6097bbb7f080b4ed93e0e0f08/0_95_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aea8657ebc925f750a029e62b2b54a9","title":"liverpool bournemouth premier league match report","story":"Anger shaped Jürgen Klopp’s reaction to Sadio Mané’s winning goal against Bournemouth. Joy, laced with relief, fuelled the return of his trademark celebration after Liverpool put the one bad week in their phenomenal season behind them. Three punches in front of the Kop: one for each victory Liverpool require to guarantee their first league championship for 30 years.Mohamed Salah marked his 100th Premier League appearance for the Anfield club with his 70th league goal before Mané brought Liverpool a new English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home league wins. Those are just the headline figures. This was a dogged fight back to winning ways after three defeats in four matches, one that began with conceding a controversial early goal to Callum Wilson, involved a spectacular goal-line clearance from James Milner and ended with a let-off from Nathan Aké in the 90th minute. Liverpool needed cool heads to get over the line rather than polished feet and Milner and Virgil van Dijk delivered with outstanding second-half displays. They were also indebted to cheap Bournemouth errors for the goals that restored invaluable confidence before Atlético Madrid’s visit in the Champions League on Wednesday.“I am happy about the result, the three points and the performance,” said Klopp. “I knew it would be tricky. The decision of the referee around the goals made it more tricky. We wanted to fight back and after that we really had to fight back.”Eddie Howe’s relegation-threatened team were under siege from the start as Liverpool sought to repair their recent blip. Then, from their first attack of note, the visitors were ahead. There was uproar around Anfield as Wilson escaped with a shove on Joe Gomez in the build-up. It was accompanied by the sound of 50,000-plus bums squeaking. Wilson clearly knocked Gomez off balance as they pursued a clearance into the Liverpool half. The ease with which the Liverpool defender was knocked off his stride was also apparent, so too the hosts’ failure to play to the whistle as Wilson found Philip Billing, who released Jefferson Lerma for a low cross turned in by the striker. Anfield waited for VAR to chalk off Wilson’s goal. Surprisingly the wait was in vain.Klopp and his assistant, Pepijn Lijnders, spent the delay raging at the fourth official. These tests rarely arise when everything is clicking seamlessly into place and a 30-year wait for the title becomes a procession. But here it was. Liverpool’s defence again looked vulnerable and will need to improve against Atlético while Bournemouth’s kept its shape in the immediate aftermath of Wilson’s opener. Adrián, deputising for the injured Alisson, pushed an Aké header against the bar as the visitors almost doubled their advantage.Aaron Ramsdale, the visiting goalkeeper, had only one shot to save in the first 24 minutes, a volley from Roberto Firmino that he blocked at close range. In the clear-up operation that followed, Steve Cook pulled his hamstring and had to be replaced by Jack Simpson. The departure of the disconsolate Bournemouth captain felt significant. Simpson’s calamitous introduction to proceedings ensured it would be. “That was the hammer blow,” said Howe of his captain’s exit.Simpson sent a routine clearance to the feet of a Liverpool player with one of his first touches. Moments later, receiving possession under no pressure deep in his own half, the 23-year-old miscontrolled and made matters worse by attempting to cut inside Mané. The Senegal striker relieved the substitute of the ball and found Salah scampering into the area. Mané misjudged his pass behind Salah but the Egypt international was able to collect, turn and squeeze his shot inside Ramsdale’s post. In the process Salah became the first Liverpool player since Michael Owen in 2002-03 to reach the 20-goal mark in three successive seasons.The leaders were more controlled after the break, with Mané hitting the bar with a spectacular effort from distance, but they needed Milner to produce a superb goal-line clearance from Ryan Fraser’s lob over Adrián. In the final minute Aké found himself with only the Liverpool goalkeeper to beat but elected to pass to Wilson, who scuffed his attempt and was offside anyway. “I can’t be too critical of what we did,” said the Bournemouth manager. “But two moments in our half where we turned the ball over too easily cost us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2380f28639e91ce3d8f0f8ea205a9dd4e236370/0_3_3825_2296/master/3825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4779c34e0f05fdf0c2f6845f8ab63a2","title":"manchester derby united city business","story":"Manchester United’s huge social media following means that, in lucrative data terms, there is only one winner against CityA couple of weeks ago, at 8am New York time, Manchester United plc held its quarterly earnings call, in which senior board members talked through some of the club’s recent successes. For instance, the last week of January saw the club’s second-highest social media engagement ever, with more than 300,000 mentions of the new signing Bruno Fernandes on Twitter, and 38 million interactions in total. Odion Ighalo was the top trending topic worldwide, beating both Brexit and Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. Meanwhile the Chinese New Year product line had performed well, and the megastore was experiencing what the managing director, Richard Arnold, described as “strong increases in average basket size”.The following night, at the Bernabéu, Manchester City beat Real Madrid 2-1 in the Champions League, a competition in which United are not playing this season.Perhaps this is a slightly tendentious juxtaposition to make on the eve of the 182nd Manchester derby. What it does encapsulate, however, is the increasing clarity with which these two rival clubs have come to define themselves against each other: each, in a way, craving what the other has.Starved of competitive success since the Ferguson era, United’s off-field plan has been geared towards building a business model more or less independent of it. Instead they have sought to leverage their enormous fanbase, boasting to potential investors about their “worldwide platform” of “1.1 billion fans and followers”. It was two years ago, during a similar quarterly conference call, that United’s chief executive, Ed Woodward, admitted: “Playing performance doesn’t really have a meaningful impact on what we can do on the commercial side.”This does not mean United are indifferent to results, not least because their turnover is forecast to plummet next season as a result of failing to qualify for the Champions League. But it is interesting that, when Arnold recently named the two key factors in keeping United’s sponsors happy, trophies and winning were not mentioned at all. The first factor, Arnold said, was “fan engagement” – growing their fanbase and turning them into consumers. This is why United are so fixated on social media numbers: they are a measurable gauge of the audience they can offer to advertisers. Winning trophies is a good way of driving engagement. But then so is a video of Alexis Sánchez in front of a piano.The second factor, according to United’s managing director, was analytics and data – not the sort of data that helps to identify potential signings or flag up players in need of a rest but the sort that can help a brand reach a captive audience without them even realising they are being shown an advert, the kind of thing that, until recent years, has largely been the preserve of big platforms like Facebook rather than sports teams. And United believe that, however far behind the elite they may have fallen on the pitch, this is one area in which they are undisputed market leaders.To see how it works in practice, just download the official United app. From the moment it opens, you are exposed to what Arnold refers to as “enhanced personalisation” and the “gamification of content”. The very first screen asks you who your favourite United player is. The next invites you to “sign for United” by creating your own personalised United shirt and entering some user details. At every turn you are confronted with quizzes, polls, tactile interactive features, all subtly branded and studded with reminders to visit the online shop or buy a hospitality package. And every time you tap the screen, you are providing United with more data: data that can then be used to provide you with your very own personalised advertising experience.City, naturally, yearn for just a fraction of this reach. They would love a data goldmine on United’s scale and complexity. They would love to be able to recreate the grip United seems to hold on both social media and traditional, their ability to shape the conversation, their coterie of former players on television. And so, in the absence of United’s historical footprint and global fanbase, they have instead tried to establish their dominance of the market in very different ways.The City Football Group’s umbrella of franchise clubs, from New York to Melbourne to Mumbai, is an attempt to recreate in composite what United are trying to achieve on their own: an organic presence in every key market. It is an idea that City’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, first developed at Barcelona, and the recent investment of the US private equity firm Silver Lake values the entire group at £3.7bn.Unlike the United model the City model demands competitive success as a prerequisite. Its entire brand is founded on the idea of exceptionalism: an exemplary standard of football, of coaching and player development, even of beauty. It thus needs titles and accolades and jaw-dropping feats in order to sustain itself. “Achieving a specific level of revenue or income is not an objective on its own,” writes Soriano in his book Goal: The Ball Doesn’t Go In By Chance. “A good football product is a team that wins.”These are two definitions of success, of dominance, even of size. If City could be forgiven for envying United’s turnover and audience, United fans must long for the sort of targeted investment and long-term vision that has sustained City’s decade of success on the pitch. When your stadium is falling to bits and your club has been laden with half a billion pounds in debt, it is hard to summon too much enthusiasm for another week of record social media engagement.And so to a derby that over recent years has specialised in confounding expectations. United tore City to shreds in the reverse league fixture at the Etihad in December. The following month City did the same at Old Trafford in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. Two years ago a gleeful United forestalled City’s title celebrations with a remarkable 3-2 comeback win. Sunday’s meeting between an in-form United and formidable City is equally tough to call.Perhaps this should not be so surprising. This is, after all, how football is supposed to be: wild, untameable, impossible to predict. You build the strongest commercial machine the sport has ever seen and end up missing out on the Champions League three seasons out of six. You make European success your entire raison d’être and Uefa chucks you out for two seasons.In a way this is the greatest irony of all: for all United’s and City’s designs on control, for all their attempts to iron the caprice and uncertainty out of the game, there will always be a piece of football that defies all attempts to control it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a738c0fedf33301c81e0f77707747b4fb9338714/0_636_8272_4963/master/8272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f34d2f62d72994e1646b21e227795e","title":"ashish gupta colour and sequins are my response to our terrifying world ","story":"The designer, 45, on optimistic pessimism, missing his mum’s cooking, nearly dying in Moscow and dreaming at Saint MartinsSelf-sufficiency and survival were values instilled in me by my parents.

There were endless courses and the venue logistics were dizzying. She recalls nights of “carnage, complete carnage!”House-hunting in 2018, she knew that wherever she lay her spatula, her new home had to double as a photogenic, practical work space. Her two-bedroom flat in a converted Victorian Grade II listed school in Hackney does just that. It’s a double height, 940sq ft open-plan space with a fluid, ergonomic design.“The kitchen was my starting point,” she says of the recent renovation of the home she shares with husband Thom Archer, who works in media recruitment. “Everything was literally built around it. Planning a kitchen is like choosing your wedding dress – how do you even know what your ideal kitchen is? I was like a wild bride in a crazy dress” – a dress that wasn’t fit for purpose.The solution was a dazzling but practical kitchen that sits in an L-shaped space with the dining area beneath a mezzanine. This is home to the couple’s gallery bedroom and to a smaller second bedroom, reached by a steep staircase, which they moved to the core of the space. “The kitchen used to be under the mezzanine and there was lots of silver and wires everywhere. It was a bit like the Titanic. There was a wall iding it up. What I needed was space.”Barnett took inspiration from the kitchens of friends, including chefs Sami Tamimi and Tara Wigley, who work with Yotam Ottolenghi fashion designer Henry Holland and presenter Nick Grimshaw. Her own was designed by Pluck, a south London company that specialises in clutter-free kitchens. “Look,” she says, opening the door of one of the elm units. Rows of storage jars reveal themselves on the back of the doors and on the shelves. “A built-in larder!”The flat works a restrained palette of shades of white offset by blocks of black. “I love colour,” she says. “I’m really drawn to it, but I also wanted a calm space.” The walls are painted in Flannel Flower Lime by lime-paint company Bauwerk Colour, the Crittall windows that overlook a courtyard in Little Greene’s Lamp Black, and the blinds are charcoal.The flat’s natural light is what sold the space to Barnett. “Come spring the whole vibe of our home changes. The sun shines through all morning long, it’s my favourite part of the day and was a big part of wanting to share this space with people. It’s bright and calm. The challenge was to get the lighting right once the space is dark.” She worked with interior design company Studio Clement to create an open plan space that was “cohesive and worked in an ergonomic way, offering symmetry and fluidity”.For Barnett, joy is in the detail. In the kitchen, the Himalayan pink salt in a jar on an open shelf matches a rose butter dish further along it. Accents of gold on white are everywhere, from the kitchen’s brass mixer tap, to the gold-framed Tracey Emin print – Barnett’s engagement present to Thom – to the light switches (by Buster and Punch) and rings of gold on the pendant lights.There’s more gold in the bathroom, a “calm cocoon” off the tiny hallway. The black paintwork, including the ceiling, complements the white marble sink, and soothing amber marble tiling (from Mandarin Stone). “I’ve learned to just go with my gut feeling. I know what I like.” The brass taps, from Studio Ore, are impossibly glamorous. “They are my biggest extravagance. Thom was, like, we will take these with us when we leave!”The feeling of tranquillity is continued with more soft whites in the main bedroom, from the cream headboard of their huge bed to the white panelling and matching linens and sheepskin rug. While the low ceilings mean this is not a space to do your sun salutations, it is a great spot to look down on Ted the Kerry Blue Terrier, often to be seen lying on the cream rug (by Danish company Menu), his black coat working the monochrome theme. A wall of exposed brick work offers more texture, as does the paintwork of the ceiling and dining area cupboards in Setting Plaster by Farrow \u0026amp Ball. Two other paintings in, you guessed it, black and white, are by Barnett. “I saw something and copied it. I can always paint over it if I want to – do something bright.”The dining table is covered in champagne coupes and flowers on the day I visit, lending the home a Mrs Dalloway air of expectation. “It’s important to be yourself and channel what you actually like, not buy into trends.

Jeeva, who has the comprehension and mathematical ability of a child twice her age, says: “I like reading and learning about things in the world and how they work.”She is chatty and sociable despite the fact that, for most of her babyhood she was the only child in her year group who could talk. “I wished they could, because then I could have lots more friends,” she says.Teachers at her private preschool (including Mrs Smart and Mrs Brain, their real names “It’s like a Mr Men book,” Jeeva is quick to point out) invite her to read to classmates. “No one else can read the words that I’m saying,” she says. She goes to gymnastics, and is learning chess and coding. She also has high emotional intelligence and describes feelings in depth. A simple question about her day can trigger lengthy conversations about outer space or how blood pumps around the body. Her parents limit screen time to once a week, during which she has watched the animated film Cars 2 and set her sights on becoming a racing driver, she tells me.Malveen remembers how she used to turn toys upside down to look at the workings: “We decided early on to ignore the age range on games – these immediately put limits on a child.” But when we discuss her intelligence, her parents are quick to remind her that she is kind, too. “We don’t want her to only be in one box: clever,” Malveen says. “My main thing is that she feels happy and fulfilled, because that isn’t always the case when chasing perfection. We model failure for her, making mistakes in front of her. We ask each day what her successes were, and what she failed at, and celebrate both.”“Most of all she loves to talk to us,” Hardeep says. “She’s always trying to crack a joke and is very playful. She’s just a child who needs to enjoy being a child.”“When I was six years old, my mum asked me what I wanted for Christmas,” Nathan says. “I asked for a book about how to be your best self. We searched online, and on bookshop and library shelves, but it didn’t exist. So the opportunity to write it myself was born.” He finished the book two days before his eighth birthday, recruiting Paralympic archer Danielle Brown as co-author after hearing her speak at a Mensa event. “We went to the book fair together,” Nathan says. “I told publishers the backstory and they said yes right there and then. I was very proud.”Nathan is plucky, eloquent – and more painstakingly polite than any adult I have met. “I’ve always been interested in self-development,” he says. “I want to spread that message to all children. Everyone I meet says this is rare for a child, but it comes naturally to me. I’m full of confidence and gratitude for my opportunities.”The book was published in the UK last year and launches in the US this month Nathan hopes motivational speaking bookings will follow. “I hope I get to fly all over the world,” he says. “That’s my dream – to travel and learn about different cultures. I want to go to Disneyland, and I’d like to stay with indigenous tribes to learn about plants and medicines.”Nathan now plays the piano at grade five standard his favourite composers are Bach and Beethoven. He is in a swimming team and a European title-holder in Brazilian jiu-jitsu (“I love the discipline and ethos,” he says. “It’s quite tactical, like 3D chess”). He also practises yoga and meditation: “It’s all about harmony and balance, to ground yourself after a busy day.” He watches TV only occasionally, usually David Attenborough documentaries, and is a “huge bookworm”, preferring books on geology, world history or motivational titles.Two years ago, Nathan’s father moved out of the family home, leaving him, his mother and two younger siblings, Simeon, eight, who is also in Mensa, and Oriana, three. Nathan says: “I think having a high IQ made it harder when my dad left,” he says. “I felt I should be able to understand, but I just can’t. We all have a story.”All three children are home-schooled. Their mother, Anna, 40, a lawyer and psychotherapist, says she was known as “the brains of the family” as a child, but frequently felt misunderstood. She didn’t start Nathan in mainstream education, but he attended for a year aged six, when she was unwell. His unhappiness led the family to visit an educational psychologist, who revealed the extent of Nathan’s intellect. Soon after that, Anna took him out of school again.“One school teacher nicknamed him ‘glum Nathan’,” Anna claims. “He hated every moment. The minute you mention intelligence, there’s a stigma a perception of silver-spoon upper-class kids on their way to Oxbridge, and a bragging, pushy parent. Gifted children can have barriers to break through and come from every background and life circumstance.”Nathan says: “I tried school, but no one understood my jokes or really got me. Everyone’s different. I try not to sweat the small stuff. I’ve got better friends now that I follow my passions instead of the crowd. I can discuss physics or marine biology with them, and they don’t make me feel weird.” He reels off a huge list of academic interests: Latin and classical studies Mandarin and Chinese Spanish, nutrition, debating, Stem subjects and psychology. He is working on his second book, too. “But I’m keeping the details a bit hush-hush,” he says. He thinks clever children are often misunderstood. “We’re more than brains on legs. We have hearts and souls, dreams and feelings, too.”Abbey lists her interests as architecture, space exploration, inventing and home science experiments, and is hoping for a place at grammar school next year. Her IQ of 144 was not tested until a year ago, when teachers called her parents into school, expressing concerns that she was depressed. Five minutes into an appointment with a private psychologist, her parents, account manager Belinda, 43, and Duncan, 45, a director of an IT company, were told: “This child is not depressed, she’s a genius.”Abbey is creative and methodical. At 18 months, she cut perfect circles with scissors aged two, she described a seven-mile car journey to her parents using simple directions (“go there, turn here”) because she wanted to visit a cafe, but didn’t know its name. At six, she would craft intricate fishermen and animals from tinfoil.While Abbey enjoys playing with her younger sisters, Cameron and Erin, she has not celebrated a birthday with friends since she was six, and has already moved schools once since emigrating from South Africa to the UK last year. “I see that I’m a bit different, but in a good way,” Abbey says. “If someone tells me I’m really clever, it makes me happy and proud, but kids can be mean. At break time, I like to talk about science and things, but the others like to play. Once they agreed to talk about maths with me, then ran away. That made me feel really sad.”Abbey is dyslexic and more comfortable in the company of adults, but has found like-minded friends through Mensa. “It’s easier to be with clever kids, because you can talk about stuff you like doing,” she says. “I usually finish my schoolwork so quickly that I have to do extra worksheets, fetch stuff from the printer or help others with their work.“In year one, the maths was really easy. I told my mum and she spoke to the teachers to ask for something harder, which she still does,” Abbey says. “I’m in a higher maths class than my friends. They finish their work as quickly as they can, but I want to stay in class longer. It’s fun and challenging when you’ve not seen something before and you get it for the first time.“At home, I love baking and cooking. My dad lets me cook dinner with him. I like reading animal encyclopaedias and trying experiments. I know, for example, that octopuses have three hearts – but what do they do with them? I watch TV, but mostly enjoy art and teaching my puppy, Simba, tricks.”Abbey shows me her sketch book, containing silhouettes of a boat and a page of perfectly spherical doughnuts, shaded with coloured pencil. In South Africa, she was spotted as a “future talent” by a Johannesburg art dealer, and has won competitions here, too. “I sold some of my art to the psychologist who did my assessment and asked for a microscope instead of payment,” Abbey says. “I won a hotel talent competition when I was little with a one-minute drawing of a unicorn.” This facility with art and science is not unusual among children with high IQs. Educator and psychologist Lyn Kendall, Mensa’s gifted-child consultant, explains: “Research shows that the majority of exceptionally able children are good all-rounders due to their highly competitive and driven natures. When they are younger, art may not be a strong point for them, but once their coordination develops, it becomes something else to excel at.”Abbey hopes to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, but her ambitions do not end there. “I’d like to go into space or build a hover car that flies over water and mountains,” she says.By the time Zayan was two, he could count to 100. Today he is in year two, but is given year five work. “Maths is my best lesson because it’s really easy,” he says. “My favourite part is doing ides in my head. In maths, my best friend does easy sheets. I do fractions and multiplications.” He enjoys other lessons, too. Excitedly, he says: “We’re learning about dreams and goals right now. Mine is to become an engineer. I would make stuff, like a Lego drill that can drill for metal.” He runs to get his favourite Lego creation: a 1,167-piece, VW Beetle for ages 16+. He is learning the ukulele and recorder, and enjoys using music apps. “I’ve got something where I can make any beats I want.” His mother and father, Sameela and Adeel, both 29, run a footwear business and were young parents. They are graduates, but wouldn’t describe themselves as being above average intelligence, and have found Zayan’s ability overwhelming. By three, he could count in four languages – Arabic, Urdu, English and Spanish – and knew the English and Arabic alphabets. “He’d hear something in Arabic once or twice at his grandparents’ and pick it up,” Sameela says. “He brought home a picture book from kindergarten and asked, ‘What kind of book is this, there are no words?’ He had a huge interest in numbers, and little quirks, too. He didn’t like foods touching on his plate, and would never get muddy.”It was only when his brother Raafi, four, arrived that his parents realised Zayan was different. Raafi hit milestones in line with most children and long after his brother had they were able to compare the boys’ behaviour, too. As well as an inquisitive mind, Zayan had the heightened emotions common in gifted children. At nursery, he experienced separation anxiety and would cry until he was sick. When Zayan was five, a psychologist confirmed an IQ of 150, the mathematical comprehension of a nine-year-old and the reading age of a 10-year-old.“At first I didn’t think he was gifted,” Sameela says. “I just needed help. I struggled with how to occupy him or answer his questions.” She sometimes feels obliged to play down his intelligence: “People stare or listen once they hear him speak. They ask what I do to make him so smart. When I say I don’t do anything, I often get a shocked face, as though I’m lying. The only thing we push him to do is to work on his confidence.”Now Zayan attends private school – a choice the family might not have made if he wasn’t so bright – but still struggles emotionally. “He’s never just gone somewhere and started playing,” Sameela says. “He stands back and analyses. His best friends are girls because they’re less boisterous. He feels safe with them, but has huge meltdowns. If they don’t need a boy for their princess game, he gets really upset, really quickly. Emotions are extreme. I book lots of clubs for him at lunchtime so he doesn’t have to deal with playtime.”In Zayan’s bedroom, his shelf is stacked with Roald Dahl and Horrid Henry collections he’s read them all. He shows me his newest invention – a “rocking rover” vehicle – and his toy drone. “I love flying my drone or paper planes,” he says. Today is Tuesday, which is homework day. “I’m glad when that’s out of the way. The worst thing about school is comprehension, and going up the tiring stairs. But the best thing is having a long lunchtime. And maths.”Luca was found to have an IQ of 158 when his academy tested its brightest year eight pupils – a recent offer to schools that Mensa credits with bringing in more young members. “They’d give a complicated word and ask for a synonym,” he remembers. “I’m not saying it was easy, but I just worked through.” He describes himself as a “human calculator”, and is now doing GCSE-level maths.“I like studying variables and I’d love to use my maths inside Nasa,” he says. “People think of astronauts, but I want to understand how rockets are programmed and engineered.” Chatting at home after school, Luca is initially reserved, but talks with enthusiasm about studying. “I love having my mind challenged,” he says. “I knew my times tables in reception. By year two, I was doing year six multiplication and long ision. I was years ahead, so they would give me algebra. I knew I was bright. We had maths puzzles at home and mum would turn everything into a game. She filled our house with books.”Luca lives with his mother Patrizia, 42, an immigration officer, father Mark, 45, a transport worker, and younger brother Simone, seven. Patrizia was also a bright child, but did not have the opportunities or encouragement to pursue her love of learning. “I didn’t realise the importance of it,” she says. “As a mum, I try to support him practically and emotionally. I make sure there are books to feed his appetite for knowledge, and explain why children can be cruel, because they don’t understand the importance of certain things or have the right values. Our greatest wish is that our child fulfils his dreams. Being in Mensa is opening a lot of doors.”That doesn’t necessarily mean job opportunities – Mensa’s consultant Lyn Kendall says that some members don’t put Mensa on their CVs as it can make employers wary. But it is a place to network: the organisation hosts social events for youngsters, has junior newsletters and web forums. Kendall also runs a Facebook group for parents. She says many don’t realise how gifted their children are until they begin education and socialising while they fit in in their own, often intelligent, households, others notice their precociousness and impose identities on them. “The minute they go out into the world, they get people saying, ‘Aren’t you clever?’ at the time when they’re building an identity. They often don’t know how to fail or how to study. A lot of them refuse school or drop out of university because of their fear of failure. Unless you’re very careful, they can grow up to be very fragile people.”Still, Luca says his maturity has left him feeling lonely. “No one likes a know-it-all,” he says. “Mum and dad have told me that being intelligent has negatives now, but will have positives when I do jobs that bring me happiness.”Luca enjoys computer games and watching fantasy and action films, like Men In Black. “I’m always looking below the surface, wondering how creators came up with those characters.” At weekends, he hangs out with his younger brother and parents, or does extra maths papers. He has “a couple of friends”, but rarely goes on playdates and is happiest taking tests. “When I’ve done well, I’ve made myself and my family proud,” he says.1,991 Members of Mensa, the high IQ society, who are under 1710½ Age at which children can sit the adult intelligence test, comprising verbal and non-verbal reasoning papers£250+ Cost of Mensa assessment with a private psychologist for younger children, using puzzles and games• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c61c7a4ee51d6fc4579c138864aafcb13d6ba1/540_1056_1241_745/master/1241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=673d20f4ba201eb82be5459bd4ef0c48","title":"embroidered female portraits in pictures","story":"“I never studied embroidery formally,” says Malaysian-born artist Sheena Liam, who creates female portraits in dark thread, with strands used to represent hair escaping in locks and plaits from the canvas.

Oxford University has stated its opposition to “no-platforming” and declared it would ensure there would be no repeat of this situation. Meanwhile, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said on Friday evening that the government would step in if universities failed to “defend free speech”.But Safa Sadozai‎, from the Oxford Feminist Society, drew a distinction between the event – advertised as a celebration of Rudd’s achievements for women, without mentioning the Windrush scandal – and a debate where views were challenged robustly.“All the promotional material spoke about Rudd’s role in encouraging women to get involved in parliament and the UN,” Sadozai‎ said. “Under that context, it didn’t sound like it could ever be an open debate where views are challenged.”She said it was widely accepted the decision was last-minute, but described the invitation as “misjudged” and criticised the response of the university.“It’s been misunderstood by the university as a free-speech issue or no-platforming,” Sadozai said. “Many people here were saying she is not entitled to be celebrated or upheld as a feminist.”According to the official Facebook listing for the event, the conversation was expected to be premised around the former minister for women and equalities’ work in a traditionally male-dominated field.The listing said that Rudd had championed equality, urged tough legal penalties to eradicate female genital mutilation and called for a higher proportion of women in cabinet. Rudd has also chaired a cross-party inquiry into unplanned pregnancies, which called for statutory sex and relationships education in all secondary schools, the UNWomen Oxford society said.But Sadozai said: “I personally don’t think she has been very inspiring, but it depends how other women want to perceive her..“For an event like International Women’s Day, which is about solidarity, it can’t be that difficult to find someone who has had less of a controversial career. It felt like they were disregarding her role in the Windrush scandal.”Rudd stepped down as home secretary as the Windrush scandal escalated and it emerged she had misled parliament over the existence of targets within the Home Office to deport undocumented migrants.The former Tory MP, who stood down at the last election, said the decision to “no-platform” her shortly before the event “to encourage young women into politics” was badly judged. “They should stop hiding and start engaging. #FreeSpeech,” she tweeted on Friday.Lord MacDonald, the warden of Oxford’s Wadham College, said attendees would have had the opportunity to challenge Rudd on her record and that a free exchange of ideas was fundamental to university life.“It was made clear by this society in advance that people would be free to question her about her policies in government and the impact they had on women of all races,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“The University of Oxford has a very robust free-speech policy, which acknowledges that a part of free expression is a willingness to be confronted with views that you might find unsettling, extreme or even offensive.”Last month, historian Prof Selina Todd was forced to pull out of an event after a boycott threat from other speakers. Williamson said it was “unacceptable” for two speakers to have been “no-platformed at Oxford within a week”.“It is not enough to adopt free-speech codes if they are not enforced,” he told the . “I expect the University of Oxford to take robust action over these incidents – and, if universities are not prepared to defend free speech, the government will.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e647101750f5eda77ffa3fc89603177ec5a7f961/1_0_2546_1527/master/2546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d944649af5e89756a498a126f22ede3c","title":"gold the ultimate safety asset or a shiny relic of the past","story":"At times of uncertainty, people view gold as a low-risk, reliable store of value. We take a closer look at the well-known investment safe havenGold is the original precious metal. It is rich in symbolism but it’s also rich in function. Over millennia, it has been used for coins, jewellery, ornamentation, medals, electronic components, the basis of monetary systems and the titles of countless James Bond films. But, recently, people have been reminded of its historic use as a comparatively safe store of value.The bank was explaining why it still kept gold reserves. But during these times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, its words sparked media discussions about investors buying up gold in a flight to financial safety.Unlike cash, the value of gold isn’t eroded by inflation. It is highly fungible and can easily be converted into hard currency wherever you are in the world. In extreme cases, such as in war-torn countries, if you lose everything else, you can carry a couple of small gold bars out with you. It also has a great heritage and global branding given that people have historically relied on it during times of political turmoil. “For thousands of years gold has been a store of value,” says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, the online consumer investing platform.In recent months, the value of gold has increased amid concerns about the global economy and the spectre of a full-scale trade war between the US and China. The price of gold hit £1,278 an ounce last September as large numbers of investors bought into the precious metal during something of a rush to so-called “safe-haven” assets. These are lower-risk assets that are expected to retain their value or even grow in value when other assets fall – thereby helping investors to limit their exposure to losses. “You want assets that perform when the stock market doesn’t,” says Lowcock.Other safe-haven investments include defensive stocks that are less vulnerable to economic downturns, such as utility companies, supermarkets and other businesses that provide everyday essentials. Likewise, bonds usually offer more predictable returns than shares, and certain currencies such as the Yen and Swiss Franc are also seen as safe-haven investments.But while gold arguably remains the best-known financial safe haven, its safety as an investment largely depends on what you’re looking for.One of gold’s chief disadvantages as an investment is that it doesn’t provide you with an income. It pays no interest or idends, unlike shares or cash on deposit. The only money you make on gold is capital appreciation when the price goes up. However, in an economic environment where interest rates are very low (and bond yields are also very low), a lack of income from gold may not be that much of an issue.A bigger problem perhaps is that gold prices can and do fluctuate – and often considerably. In Davos, in 2010, George Soros famously said: “When interest rates are low we have conditions for asset bubbles to develop, and they are developing at the moment. The ultimate asset bubble is gold.”It’s also worth remembering that all safe-haven investments have potential downsides. Indeed, the only safe haven that can’t lose you money is cash – although it can lose you value in high inflation environments and it generally provides a poor return in low inflation environments such as the one we’re currently in.Of course, economic fundamentals aside, centuries of symbolism mean that gold’s emotional and psychological value is unlikely to fade any time soon. And as our faith in our financial system is continually tested, perhaps it will one day come to symbolise the important value of safety as much as wealth.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Sometimes I turned over two pages at once, sometimes three. What did it matter? There was no shape to it. No linkage from one proposition to another. The very antithesis of an Aristotelian pattern.”Then a new Labour member, Clare Short, protested, saying it was “disrespectful to the house and to the office that he holds that he should come here in this condition.” Members took sides. “Screams, yells, shouts of ‘Withdraw’, counter shouts. General uproar ... The House was alight.”That was the era of late-night sittings and votes, when there were fewer women MPs in an unreformed parliament, and when over-indulgence was much more common. But almost four decades later, the propensity for MPs to drink too much, and the way the Westminster culture encourages them to do so, is still causing concern.Last week the British Medical Journal published results of a survey of MPs, conducted in late 2016 but not revealed until now, which found that binge drinking – having more than six units in one session – was more common among those who make the laws of the land than the general public.One of those behind the survey was Tory MP Dan Poulter, a GP, teetotaller and part-time NHS psychiatrist. Poulter has also carried out research on the links between the Westminster culture and mental health problems.The survey found that as a group they were more likely to “drink riskily” and down the equivalent of a bottle of wine on a standard day than the public. And while parliament provided help for MPs with drink problems through its own health and wellbeing service, the study found more than three quarters of members were unaware of its existence.The former Tory MP and former chair of the all-party select committee on health and social care, Sarah Wollaston, welcomed the survey. She said that although during her 10 years as an MP she had seen a definite reduction in excessive drinking by MPs, there was still a tendency for a minority to “cruise from reception to reception picking up free alcohol along the way”. Poulter said the Commons authorities should reduce the availability of alcohol at Westminster so it was more in line with parliaments in other countries: “It is extraordinary that there are so many bars in parliament where alcohol is available at almost every hour of the day.“This is not the case in other parliaments elsewhere in the world and is certainly not the case in other workplaces where drinking alcohol is not acceptable during working hours. It is important that parliament takes note of our research and brings the working environment into the 21st century. This is particularly important for those MPs who have developed a difficult relationship with alcohol.”Another of the report’s authors, Tony Rao, a psychiatrist at King’s College London, said: “The observation that MPs in this study showed higher levels of daily, weekly and binge drinking than other comparable groups may be a reflection of how having a drink in parliament could simply mean just a short walk down the corridor.”A House of Commons spokesperson said efforts were being made to encourage responsible drinking: “The House of Commons Commission has agreed a number of actions to promote responsible alcohol consumption, including increasing the range of non-alcoholic drinks and lower strength beers available, expanding and encouraging alcohol-free areas, discouraging members and staff from drinking in offices after bars are shut, and not running promotional advertisements for alcohol.“The Parliamentary Health and Wellbeing Service is on hand to offer support to anyone working on the estate with physical, mental health or wellbeing issues.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67d6e45c126d2b36c863534baef4ee707216e82/0_225_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9ef8c488265d4e22947fc84264aad1d","title":"england wales six nations match report","story":"Manu Tuilagi’s late red card for a dangerous tackle on George North was the one blemish for England on an afternoon when they won the triple crown after systematically destroying the defending champions, who went down to a third successive defeat in a Six Nations campaign for the first time since 2007. The scoreline suggested a close contest but two late tries by Wales when England were down to 13 players did not mask the deep ide between the sides.Wales are in transition after 12 years under the relentless regime of Warren Gatland. If there is a sense of liberation in the way they are playing under Wayne Pivac, they have lost their pragmatism and become careless and disjointed. They were willing but wanting here, not just overpowered by opponents who base their game on forcing opponents into physical submission but outplayed.There was a composure and an authority about England that Wales lacked. Three attacking lineouts led to 17 of England’s 20 points in the opening half: two tries from simple moves that unpicked what last year was the championship’s meanest defence with surprising ease, plus the second of Owen Farrell’s three penalties.In contrast, Wales squandered opportunities. North lost control of the ball after being tackled short of the line before Hadleigh Parkes knocked on after coming into the line at pace after a lineout. They scored three tries after the interval, the first a counterattacking gem 25 seconds after the restart, but the final two came when Ellis Genge was in the sin-bin for England’s persistent infringing and Tuilagi was reflecting on another layoff after leading with his shoulder as North neared England’s line and he made contact with the wing’s head.When Tuilagi scored his side’s third try on the hour, England led 33-16 and were closing in on the bonus point they failed to secure in victory over Ireland in the previous round. It eluded them again as Wales picked themselves off the floor to enjoy their most sustained attacking period of the match. Mistakes continued to undermine them, Parkes again losing control of the ball close to the line, but England’s willingness to give away penalties in their mission to slow down possession cost them the presence of Genge and they played the final four minutes with 13 men.It was England’s third victory after their opening round defeat in Paris, an afternoon when a team renowned for its fast starts paid for a passive first 40 minutes. Eddie Jones’s banter in the buildup amounted to faintly hot air, but he has been largely quiet since, allowing his side to do the talking and for an hour here they resembled the side that reached the World Cup final last year, unyielding and enterprising.They gradually overpowered Wales up front, winning three penalties in the scrum, used the lineout to launch quick attacks and, through Courtney Lawes and Tom Curry especially, were forceful in the tackle. If England’s back row looked unbalanced with Curry at No 8, Mark Wilson on the open-side and Lawes also playing out of position, it worked, all-consuming and rampant. Factor in Maro Itoje and Kyle Sinckler and Wales were too often forced to play behind the gainline where they tried to live up to their new attacking ideal rather than relieve pressure and buy time.Pivac lamented poor decision-making which was symptomatic of a side in transition. Wales conceded a try after two minutes here two years ago and were 16-0 down at half-time in 2016 and needed to make a strong start. They conceded the softest of tries after three minutes, Itoje winning an attacking lineout before Ben Youngs’ inside pass to Anthony Watson confounded a defence that failed to react.Wales wasted an immediate chance to react when North lost the ball on England’s line. Farrell nudged him to spark a scuffle that ended with a smirking Joe Marler grabbing the testicles of the Wales captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who reacted with open-mouthed surprise. The dust-up was reviewed and Farrell was penalised while the England wing Jonny May left the field for a head injury assessment and did not return, Henry Slade coming on at full-back and Elliot Daly moving to the left wing.Daly scored England’s second try after Leigh Halfpenny had kicked two penalties to Farrell’s one. Sinckler won a scrum penalty, Farrell kicked into touch in Wales’s 22 and Itoje again won the throw cleanly. Two phases later George Ford stood at outside-centre, drawing North and giving Daly the room to score in the left-hand corner.Farrell made it 20-6 with a penalty two minutes from half-time after another lineout but Dan Biggar, who played with his right knee heavily strapped and was a target for England’s tacklers from the off, replied with the final kick of the opening period. Wales had been a distant second, struggling against England’s sustained aggression, but within 25 seconds of the restart they had closed the gap to four points.Ford’s kick-off saw Daly and George Kruis mess up the chase. Josh Navidi and the impressive Nick Tompkins exchanged passes before Tomos Williams arrived in support to send away Justin Tipuric on a 30-metre run under the posts. A year ago in Cardiff, England collapsed in the second half as they attempted to defend a lead and this was the moment for Wales to change the momentum again.England’s reaction was impressive. Farrell and Ford kicked penalties to give them a cushion before Youngs broke from a ruck to start a move Tuilagi finished to put his side 17 points ahead. Wales, facing a ruinous defeat, clambered off the floor but did not score until they had a two-man advantage, tries from Biggar and Tipuric giving them a bonus point that was of little consolation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c35af08c9e572d97fba1fbe907a88c0400fca6d/0_128_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478719fb9cbcfda3e2ab691bb6f255b3","title":"mickey arthur sri lanka england","story":"England have been warned to expect a war of attrition in Sri Lanka, with the country’s new head coach, Mickey Arthur, also keen to unleash one of the brightest young spin talents he has seen during the upcoming Test series.Arthur held talks with Ashley Giles over England’s head coach vacancy last year but, after Chris Silverwood got the nod to replace Trevor Bayliss, the 51-year-old signed on with Sri Lanka in December – his fourth such role in international cricket. It followed three years in charge of Pakistan, a rollercoaster spell in which they rose to No 1 Test team in the world, won the 2017 Champions Trophy in England and embarked on a hot streak of 11 series wins in Twenty20 cricket that made his removal before this year’s World Cup in the shortest format a surprise.Now ensconced in the Sri Lanka camp and claiming to be “as hungry as ever”, the genial South African is eyeing the visit of Joe Root’s England for a two-Test series and hopes his players want payback for the 3-0 home defeat they suffered in 2018.“England can expect some tough cricket,” says Arthur, taking time out from a home T20 series versus West Indies to speak to the Observer. “It’s very hot here in Colombo right now and with a two-Test series you can’t ease yourself in, you have got to hit the first Test running.Such expectations suggest that Sri Lanka have indeed moved away from the ragging pitches witnessed 18 months ago – “We don’t want to be that drastic,” explains Arthur – but despite growing seam stocks, spin will still be to the fore. And in this regard there has been a changing of the guard.England have lost Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, and only Jack Leach remains from the trio that shared 48 wickets last time, and he is accompanied by his Somerset teammate Dom Bess and the uncapped Matt Parkinson.Arthur meanwhile feels blessed with options. As well as the veteran off-spinner Dilruwan Perera, Lasith Embuldeniya – a left-armer with “huge hands who gives it a serious rip” – and the wrist-spinner Lakshan Sandakan, the head coach is purring about Wanindu Hasaranga.The 22-year-old leg-spinning all-rounder is uncapped at Test level and though his stats from 27 white-ball appearances may not yet leap off the page (bar a hat-trick on debut), Arthur is adamant Hasaranga is the next big thing. Arthur says: “This guy is something very, very special. He has got all the tricks, including a top-spinner and googly out the back of the hand I can’t pick. He is a proper batsman too – he made 44 off 34 in a T20i the other night – and a gun fielder.“I would put him in the 10 most valuable cricketers in the world right now and yet people don’t know him. He really is a hidden gem. Remember the name, because he is the man.”Such enthusiasm is typical of Arthur, so too a suggestion that Kusal Perera might return after the left-hander’s unbeaten 153 against South Africa a year ago – a tail-marshalling blitz that many believe trumps Ben Stokes at Headingley last August – was followed by a lean patch and the axe.“Kusal lost his way in Test cricket after that innings with some low scores but that was before my time,” says Arthur. “He will be in the melting pot and could give us some impetus against England’s spinners. He has the X factor and is my style of player.”Arthur was disappointed to leave Pakistan – a stint he describes as “putting out fires every day” yet “a privilege” and “a thrill a minute” – and is quick to point out that in the 50-over World Cup campaign that prompted the switch they missed out on the semis on net run-rate alone, and beat both finalists in the group stage. As well as a strong rapport with their supporters, his greatest satisfaction came from seeing players such as Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi “start to believe in themselves” and views the challenge of pushing Sri Lanka up from sixth and eighth in the Test and two white-ball rankings to be a similar case of emboldening raw talent.The relationship with the captain is key and Arthur appears enamoured with the one he inherited, saying his squad “adores playing” for Dimuth Karunaratne, the quiet yet steely opener. Looking across to England before the series opener in Galle on 19 March, he sees another team playing for their leader. Arthur says: “I do think Moeen is a big loss for England – finger spin plays a big role and he’s a quality cricketer. But I watched them in South Africa and they have gelled into a good side. Joe Root has asserted himself and developed a style. But they will be tested in different ways here and it will be interesting to see how they adapt.”In a parallel universe England might have been under Arthur’s watch and when asked if, in future, he fancies adding the role to an international coaching CV that began with South Africa and then Australia, he replies: “Never say never – who knows?“But I know I would like to settle into county cricket for a few years to end my career.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7e47c933bd5a71c388ec5e18531cbda548c223a/0_145_4385_2632/master/4385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1192b110ba505ef886834189c13ca76c","title":"more than a game of cricket mcg final is defining moment for womens sport","story":"There are hopes of a record crowd for the Women’s Twenty20 World Cup final but that should not be the end of the journeyEach game of this Twenty20 World Cup has been leading to this – the attempted world record crowd for a women’s sporting event at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Sunday’s final between Australia and India. For months, Cricket Australia and the local organising committee have been boldly espousing their hopes to break the current record of 90,185 set at the 1999 Fifa Women’s World Cup in the United States.As Australia fell to India in the opening game of the tournament, then stumbled against Sri Lanka, there must have been some bitten-down nails amongst tournament executives. The regroup against Bangladesh and the win over New Zealand to secure a semi-final place elicited a sigh of relief. And then the weather stepped in.Suddenly the loss to India wasn’t the small setback that it first appeared. With no reserve days scheduled, that loss meant that if the semi-final was rained out, Australia was out with it.Finally the game was played, Australia won and the campaign was back on track. Barring an unforeseen downpour in Melbourne on Sunday, there are no more hurdles to overcome.A win for Australia would be icing on the cake from an administrative perspective. This final has become more than just a game of cricket it has the potential to be a defining moment for women’s sport.Earlier this year, US football star Megan Rapinoe made headlines when she spoke about wanting women’s sport to be consistently marketed to adult fans, rather than relying on the ‘role model’ narrative and always targeting young girls.“You never see LeBron James purely positioned as inspiring young boys,” said Rapinoe. “No shit he’s inspiring young boys. He’s fucking LeBron James … so why are we limiting ourselves that way?”No doubt there will be young girls among the thousands at the MCG on Sunday. The next generation of Meg Lannings, Megan Schutts and Beth Mooneys will be watching, believing that they can one day play in front of a packed MCG, too. The importance of that visibility can’t be overstated.But what we have witnessed with this Australia women’s team over the past five years has been even bigger than that. The momentum around the team has grown and crowds and television audiences have expanded alongside it.It happened slowly enough that it almost wasn’t noticeable. A reference to ‘batters’ instead of ‘batsmen’ here. An understanding that ‘Healy’ means Alyssa and not Ian there. And before we knew it, people were standing around office kitchens having long conversations about Ellyse Perry’s hamstring and furious debates about whether she should be replaced by an all-rounder or a specialist bowler.The conversation has shifted and the media coverage along with it. Whereas once there was a semi-regular stream of opinion columns from earnest men deploring the lack of coverage of women’s sport before getting back to their regular routine of writing about men’s sport, now there are match reports and analysis pieces about every game. The day after the semi-final, the winning moments were plastered all over the front and back pages of major newspapers across the country. Women’s cricket is being covered and spoken about the way that followers of the sport have always wanted – as if it was just cricket.It’s likely even the tournament organisers didn’t envisage this shift when they first announced their goal. The inclusion of Katy Perry playing an exclusive Australian show at the final demonstrated a bid to go after the young girl audience. But a press release that included a tongue-in-cheek assurance that the singer is ‘no relation to Ellyse’ signified that this tactic was little more than an insurance policy the work continued behind the scenes to ensure that cricket was the centrepiece of this event.This is not the end point of this journey. It is a milestone and it should be celebrated. But there is more to tackle before equality can be declared. When news outlets can have comments open on articles about women’s sport without fear of abuse. When sporting organisations stop talking about the value of playing purely for the love of the game. These are just some of the scenarios that need to change before we can truly say that women in sport – both and off the field – are on equal footing with their male counterparts.While a world-record crowd at the MCG, if it transpires, doesn’t change everything, it is a symbol of the change that Australia can expect if we continue along this trajectory. If sporting organisations continue to set ambitious goals around women’s sport and work hard to achieve them, this will become the new normal. In time the goals won’t seem as ambitious and the work will get easier. Yes, it will inspire young girls. But it will also create communities, remove barriers and make sport more inclusive.While all eyes will be on the Australia women this Sunday, they’re just walking out to play a game of cricket, like they have done hundreds of times before. It’s those in the crowd, watching on television and talking about it in the lunch rooms who will make it so much more than that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/642938967baea6c967453b35917123a3b96e3a2d/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d72bd2b834e4306326bdd866613e4b21","title":"patrick marber the red lion leopoldstadt","story":"The playwright and director on writing and depression, collaborating with Tom Stoppard, and reconnecting with his Jewish rootsPatrick Marber is a playwright, director, screenwriter and comedian. The author of Dealer’s Choice (1995), Don Juan in Soho (2006) and Three Days in the Country (2015), he made his name internationally with Closer (1997). He often directs his own work, and plays by Tom Stoppard, Dennis Potter and Harold Pinter. His dazzling ensemble production of Stoppard’s latest, Leopoldstadt, an exploration of Viennese Jewish history, is running in the West End, while The Red Lion, his play about non-league football, is about to open at Bristol Old Vic.I’ve heard that The Red Lion was inspired by saving Lewes football club, when you lived in East Sussex?I made a promise to the manager, Steve Ibbotson – I dedicated the play to him – on a wet day in November 2009. I said: “I’m going to help you save your football club.” At the time, I didn’t feel I had anything better to do. I was one of six people who “bought” the club. It cost us a pound each and we owned it on paper for about a day before turning it into a supporter-owned club.And you hadn’t “anything better to do” because of a midlife crisis?I called it “writer’s block” then. Now, I’d call it depression. I didn’t want my voice to be heard. I’m still not sure I want my voice heard. I felt I should write about what had happened to me – someone madly trying to save his own skin, soul and sanity. But I found a different story.You’ve credited director Ian Rickson with being midwife to The Red Lion…My adaptation of Turgenev – Three Days in the Country – and The Red Lion were written coming out of depression, under Ian’s watch. He’s a playwright whisperer – he has magic in him, Ian.Perhaps you were in a similar role with Tom Stoppard, directing Leopoldstadt?We’d worked before on Travesties and he enjoyed, I think, being encouraged to do some writing by a fellow playwright. We’ve known each other for 20 years. When my first play was on at the National in 1995, Tom was very supportive. But he wasn’t used to getting notes – Peter Wood, Trevor Nunn, Richard Eyre and David Leveaux, significant previous collaborators, would direct the sacred text as written. For better or worse, I was pushier. At times he didn’t like that at other times he loved it.Did you talk about the rise of antisemitism with him?Stoppard has not experienced antisemitism because he did not grow up as a Jew. But he was interested in my account of growing up Jewish in Wimbledon in the 70s. Strangely, we realised my father was a contemporary of Tom’s invented character, Leo, in Leopoldstadt: my father, who was at Cambridge in the same generation as Jonathan Miller, and in the Footlights, was very conscious of antisemitism.What did he do?He wanted to do what I do – to be a director, a writer, a comedy person. He was director of light entertainment at the BBC, but ended up working in the City. He was amiably jealous of my career. I always felt guilty I’d achieved what he couldn’t. It was complicated. I can say it now because he is dead… it was a bit of a Freudian nightmare.Did you grow up in a strict Jewish household?We were reform Jews. Since my father died, and working on Leopoldstadt, my feeling for my Jewishness has become very strong. My father had drawn up a family tree and said: “You must study this.” But it was only after his death, reading Leopoldstadt, I had the urge to look at it. And he’d written an asterisk by everyone in the family murdered by the Nazis. I was suddenly powerfully moved and, like Tom, appalled that I hadn’t taken enough notice of this.I feel very sad my father isn’t around to see this play, because he’d have loved it.Is it easiest directing your own work?Easier – because I can change a play, without fuss, to suit the actors. That said, directing Stoppard’s new play has been a dream come true. If you’d said when I was 17, and studying Tom for my A-levels, “one day you’ll direct one of his plays”, I’d have fainted.What’s the most important advice you give them?“Don’t be like me.” I’m with Freud, that the two most important things are work and love. If you can find work you love and people you truly love, you’re blessed.Speaking of Freud, is your therapy ongoing?I’ll be in therapy for the rest of my life – as long as I can afford it. I can’t think of anyone who wouldn’t benefit. Being able to talk to a stranger and tell them everything is of enormous value – creatively and emotionally.When did you last act? And does acting feed your directing?I had a one-line part in The Vote at the Donmar. I cannot tell you how nervous I was. I remember only the blur of anxiety. It’s useful, as a director, to dip an acting toe in to remind yourself of what a strange, frightening thing it is to go out in front of strangers and speak.When I’m old, I’d like to be one of those character actors who pops up and who, hopefully, can still remember his lines. I don’t want to be writing into my 80s.What are you doing next?Habeas Corpus at the Menier Chocolate Factory. I’ve wanted to direct it for years and Alan Bennett has finally said: “All right, you can do it.”• The Red Lion is at Bristol Old Vic from Wednesday to 28 March.

It’s a trip I’ve done many times, most recently with my family. You start by the beaches of Kalamata, where my daughter was born, and a mere 10-minute drive up a small winding road takes you into the mountains, with the white houses and sea below. This is the route Telemachus (Odysseus’ son) took to visit Menelaus and Helen, newly returned from Troy.It’s Greece, so these are proper mountains. The road crests at 1,600 metres, taller than Ben Nevis, and there is a Swiss chalet-style cafe here that serves good hot chocolate. We tend to stop a bit before, at the village of Artemisia, where the Theotokos taverna has a balcony overlooking a valley on one side and a spring on the other.Locals sell herbs and honey down by the spring and the waiters (the owner’s kids) fill up your jug from it. Just before Sparta is Mystra, the ruins of a Byzantine city (pictured). The top of its battlements is my favourite spot on Earth – mountains on one side, the white splash of Sparta on the other. All of history in one spot.Andrew BostockIt started with a mug. That was when I knew I’d been accepted into the fold at Capitano del Popolo, a bar and restaurant in the Umbrian outpost of Orvieto. I’d sought temporary refuge in the hilltop town after losing my job in Rome in 2016, and was soon enraptured by its charms. Capitano del Popolo quickly became my stomping ground, a convivial place to drink caffè latte from my personal mug – a gift from the wonderful owner and chef, Valentina Santanicchio – or enjoy one of her dishes, such as handmade pappardelle with wild boar ragù, while sitting on the terrace under an often-piercing blue winter sky and marvelling at the 14th-century palace across the square.Italy is brimming with history and culture, places to visit and things to do. Venice, Rome and Florence are itinerary staples, Orvieto less so. The town, with its imposing cathedral, fresh air, sublime views of the Umbrian countryside and friendships made, is now my number one place to escape to from Rome. I often describe Orvieto as a comfort blanket, which wrapped me in its warmth at a time when it was needed most.Angela GiuffridaThe Ostend seafront is one of the places in the EU to which the UK is (geographically) closest. This two-mile strip of Belgian coastline also offers one of the loveliest strolls in Europe. A five-minute walk from the railway station, the promenade starts with stalls selling fresh seafood and chips.Continuing west, the route passes seafront cafes, museums, belle époque houses, a modernist casino, the splendid Thermae Palace Hotel, a spooky sculpture in memory of the Ostendais artist Léon Spilliaert, and children pleased to be at a favourite Belgian beach. But it’s the sea itself that will keep you staring. A hypnotic expanse of water, shifting through black and white, with blue, green and gold reflections of the sky. You can’t see Margate on the British coast but it’s only about 65 miles away.When Charlotte Brontë arrived in Belgium in 1843, she wrote of her “prosperous and speedy voyage” from London Bridge Wharf along the north Kent coast and on to Ostend. Following the suspension of passenger services from Ramsgate 170 years later, there are sadly now no ferries to this windswept haven for passengers leaving England today. Thank goodness for Eurostar.Emily WaterfieldWarsaw’s Old Powązki cemetery captures better than almost any other place the essence of a continent that so readily defines itself in terms of its history. A resting place for generations of poets, writers and composers, the cemetery is most famous for its thousands of iron, bronze and stone tombs and sepulchral sculptures, as well as the chestnut trees, oaks and lindens that shelter you from the heavens above. But what captivates me most is the beauty and variety of the names of the great and the good of 19th- and early 20th-century Warsaw that lie below them.Many have wonderful foreign names that provoke nostalgia for a long-gone Poland that was genuinely multicultural: names like Paweł Pellizzaro, Henryk Leon Malhomme, Kazimierz Wolff-Zdzienicki, Wacław Malcolm-Morris, Matylda de Castellaz-Abramowicz. While others are, to me at least, simply glorious names in their own right: Fidelis Matuszewski, Jan Habdank-Stpiczynski, Karolina Semelman Neugebauer, Hipolit Flock and my own personal favourite, Felicjan Szmakfefer.Poland’s cemeteries are known for All Saints Day commemorations (1 November), when millions of Poles gather to lay candles on the graves of loved ones and national heroes. But I find the living’s habit of making the day about themselves can be irritating, and Powązki is best visited on a winter’s weekday afternoon, when you have only the dead for company – a perfect place to reflect on the future of a country and continent that refuses to rest in peace.Christian DaviesA defunct church is potentially an eerie place, but the former church of Absalon in Copenhagen’s hip Vesterbro district is always buzzing with life and laughter. In 2014, Lennart Lajboschitz, founder of the Flying Tiger retail chain, bought the building for £1.2m and exchanged the pews and altar for long tables, comfy sofas and a bar. Now around 700 people visit this community space every day: some come to enjoy a coffee, a chat and a game of backgammon or chess, others to work on their laptops.Every evening at 6pm up to 200 people gather in the main hall for a communal meal. At around £5 a plate, it’s an affordable dining-out option that attracts people of all ages and nationalities.Others come to attend one of numerous activities: yoga, tango lessons, quizzes, drag queen bingo, table tennis, dodgeball tournaments, bridge, life drawing, a writers’ workshop and crafts such as pottery and bookbinding. Some of these may also involve drinking Baileys … because, well, why not?Andrea BakI could spend all day on the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, a unique suspension railway system in Wuppertal. Which makes me a Schwebebahnliebhaberin (floating rail aficionado), a word as slinky as the monorail system itself, an elegant, airy, 13km engineering wonder which snakes its way through the Wupper valley (between Düsseldorf and Cologne), humming along the track between Barmen and Elberfeld, and must be one of the nearest experiences to flying.“Why drive, when you can float to work?” was the thinking at the turn of the 20th century, when commuter numbers were growing and construction work on it began. Industrialisation had caused the western German region to develop so quickly that there was no room for broader streets to take the increase in traffic, and so the decision was made to go high. Steel girder construction was all the rage at the time – Paris got its Eiffel Tower, Wuppertal its floating railway, complete with the strident green limbs that give it its height and majesty.The Kaiser and his wife took a ride on it in 1900, hence the Kaiserwagen (carriage 5) with its velvet upholstery and gold trimmings, which has since been restored and can be ridden at weekends. An even more famous journey was undertaken by a circus elephant called Tuffi, who was put on it as a publicity stunt in 1950 but panicked in the overcrowded carriage and plunged into the river Wupper below. She survived with only minor injuries, as did her story, which has been retold to German children ever since.Not only is it a pleasure to ride – ideally kneeling on a seat at the back looking out of the window on to city and river life below – but also very efficient, with a train running every four minutes and reasonably priced (€2.90 for an adult single, €7.20 for 24 hours). It remains the transport of choice for Wuppertalers, moving around 25 million passengers a year.Wuppertal is also home to the dance company of the late choreographer Pina Bausch, and the Schwebebahn features in the 2011 film Pina, Wim Wenders’ tribute to Bausch.Kate ConnollyIt’s not the tallest structure in Bulgaria. It’s not even the tallest TV tower in the country (that accolade goes to Rousse). But Kopitoto, or the Vitosha Mountain TV Tower to give it its official name, has defined Sofia’s skyline since the mid-1980s.Most people are quick to laud Kopitoto (which means “the hoof”) for the spectacular views it offers over the city – it stands at 186 metres (about double the height of Big Ben) on an outcrop of the 2,290-metre Vitosha mountain, around 20km from the city centre.As a sucker for brutalist architecture, I’ve always loved the sheer scale of this concrete marvel of engineering, which is hexagonal in shape – but with three of the six sides extended, it appears almost triangular. From the 1960s until the beginning of the 90s, there was a cable car that took you up the mountain. Now the defunct graffiti-laden terminus station, right next to the TV tower, attracts urban explorers. My only regret is that it doesn’t do tours. • Svetoslav Petrov, editor-in-chief of Boyscout in BulgariaThe lifeblood of the trendy Letná district, Bio Oko cinema is the perfect place to immerse yourself in Czech culture. When I arrived a decade ago, I was here all the time, devouring every Czech-produced movie I could, trying to get to grips with the country’s dark history and offbeat humour. But it’s far more than just a cinema, and the bar outside the deckchair-strewn auditorium is a great hangout. It’s ideal for a quiet espresso during the day, but in the evening it springs into life with hip locals spilling out from the tables all the way up the stairs, drinking craft lager and eating delicious homemade quiche.The walls are lined with old communist-era movie posters, and many of these original prints are available to buy at the Terry Gilliam-inspired shop, Terry Posters (in sister cinema Kino Svtozor), from as little as €6. Mark PickeringIt’s fair to say that a few years ago Douglas Street, in Cork’s south inner city, an area blighted by the ill effects of anti-social behaviour, did not have the best of reputations. Walk along it today, however, and the historic thoroughfare, just five minutes from the city centre, has significantly been transformed.At the western end is the oasis of Nano Nagle Place, a former convent that in 2017 was converted into a complex that celebrates the extraordinary life of the eponymous 18th-century pioneer of Catholic education. There is a museum, a garden and a “sustainable foods cafe”, the Good Day Deli, in an airy modern glass pavilion.At the eastern edge is the primary engine of the area’s positive change: Coughlan’s. An almost 200-year-old “backstreet old man’s bar” taken over by musician and creative force Edel Curtin in 2012, Coughlan’s – which with pure Cork perverseness is pronounced “CAW-lans” – has since become the award-winning best music venue in the country.The intimate listening room in the formerly unloved lounge bar has a total capacity of no more than 65 seated, and yet Coughlan’s has managed to attract star American singer-songwriters Anaïs Mitchell, Ryley Walker and Sarah Jarosz, and leading Irish musicians such as Lisa O’Neill, Glen Hansard, Lisa Hannigan and Mick Flannery.It’s like a major venue in a music-savvy friend’s sitting room, with the added bonus of – so Coughlan’s claims, and with some justification – the best pint of stout in Cork.Philip WatsonThe village of Pyrga lies between Nicosia and Larnaca in the east of Cyprus. It’s a pretty place, the sort that Peter Mayle might have settled in had Provence not got him first. As it is, Pyrga’s only claim to fame is that it is home to a remarkable stone building. It could be mistaken for an old storeroom, except the gothic detail above the door hints at something more special. This building is a medieval royal chapel.Inside, damaged but beautiful frescos look as if they have been transported from medieval France. They tell the story of the marriage of King Janus to Charlotte de Bourbon in 1411, and betray the fact that Cyprus was a medieval French kingdom. Its rulers were the Lusignans, cousins to the English Plantagenets and as the chapel’s garrulous caretaker will tell you, Queen Charlotte is an ancestor of the UK’s current queen.Cyprus has not always been comfortable with its medieval heritage. For some, celebrating this French period and subsequent Venetian rule undermines the claim that Cyprus is a Greek island. Yet the Lusignans and their heirs left some stunning monuments, which easily overshadow the Roman remains at sites like Kourion. Apart from Pyrga, Kolossi and Limassol have two of the most intact Crusader castles , and the capital, Nicosia, is encircled by massive Venetian walls.Most dramatic of all, in the middle of Nicosia, sits the huge 13th-century French gothic Cathedral of St Sophia, which was converted into the the Selimiye Mosque in 1570. For a lover of medieval culture like myself, these gothic churches – many of which have been converted into mosques or subsumed into Byzantine structures – make Cyprus an unexpected revelation.Michael Paraskos, novelist and lecturerTwo former railway sheds are now home to one of the most exciting cultural spaces in Luxembourg City, which is aimed at sharing ideas and fostering new talent. Built in 1877 to store steam locomotives, the Rotondes remained underutilised throughout the 20th century (one was a warehouse, the other a bus garage). A decade ago the ministry of culture started to renovate these national monuments to host cultural activities, reopening them five years ago.The Northern roundhouse now hosts exhibitions, lectures, dance, secondhand markets and other events. The Southern roundhouse is a dark, cosy bar that holds quiz nights, concerts and theatre performances. The building between them houses Radio ARA, where I work.Once winter is over, the outdoor courtyard is filled with pallet furniture and people drinking and eating – bankers, hipsters, mums, musicians – the place is a magnet for all types, like Luxembourg itself.Wendy Winn, radio presenterRiga is an architecturally eclectic place with an incredible variety of coexisting styles: you can see the finest examples of art deco, alongside brutalist Soviet architecture and neoclassical buildings. One of my favourite places to visit is Riga Central Market, a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the Daugava a few hundred metres from the old town. It’s a wondrous blend of art deco and neoclassicism, and when it opened in 1930 it was recognised as not only the largest, but also one of the best marketplaces in Europe.The five pavilions are former zeppelin hangars, and beneath each cavernous ceiling is a specialist market selling vegetables, dairy, meat, fish and local specialities. Riga doesn’t have a historic cafe tradition like Paris or Vienna, but the place to meet artists and bump into writers or musicians is the Cafe Osiris restaurant, which has had a loyal clientele for 25 years. Owner Andrejs Žagars says: “It’s the only cafe that reflects part of Riga as it was at the beginning of the 1990s. This place ... is an authentic proof of the time when Riga was changing, when Latvia was changing.”With its simple yet refined menu, Cafe Osiris is one of my favourite places to eat in the city, and we’ve used it to host Riga Biennial dinners for visiting artists on many occasions.Agniya Mirgorodskaya, founding director of the Riga Biennial FoundationAs the Eurostar makes its way through northern France’s post-industrial heartland, passengers en route to Paris or Brussels just want to be on their way, which is a pity. In Roubaix, one of the grittier towns in a region once famous for its mines and factories, sits a jewel called La Piscine, an art deco swimming baths transformed into a museum. It doesn’t look much from the outside, but step into the pool hall, with its mosaic tiles and enamelled-brick showers, and the starburst stained-glass windows cast a magical glow over a collection of nude statues and sculptures from various artists and periods posed around the pool.When I visited for the first time, the museum was almost empty and the effect was breathtaking. The frozen figures look as if they’re about to take – or have just taken – a dip in the rippling water.There is more to La Piscine: its permanent collection, which has now been extended into a former factory next door, includes works by Giacometti, Rodin, Claudel and Picasso. But the pool hall alone is worth the visit. Get off the train at Lille and take the metro for 30 minutes to Roubaix. Paris and Brussels can wait.Kim WillsherUnlike most European capitals, Bratislava is not overcrowded. Even so, it’s hard to believe that, tucked just behind the Eurovea shopping mall, there’s such a relaxing, crowd-free spot. I discovered this Danube river walk when I was working in the city and would slip off at lunchtime to stroll beside the water and watch the ducks foraging for food. There are usually couples and colleagues picnicking along the bank, but it’s also dotted with great cafes and restaurants. My favourite is Primi, a chic, Mediterranean-style eatery that serves terrific sea bass and bowls of tasty gazpacho. I actually had my first date with my now husband here – it must have had a certain kind of magic.If you head over Starý most – a newly renovated pedestrian and tram bridge – the opposite bank offers an incredible view of Bratislava castle, especially dazzling at sunset. The “botel” and restaurant Dunajský Pivovar offers a good gawping spot, as well as some excellent Slovakian cuisine. For the complete Bratislava experience, order a plate of traditional halušky (potato dumplings with sheep’s cheese) and a summery pint of the homemade brew. Markéta HorváthováWay up north, surrounded by meadows and forests, the border between Sweden and Finland consists of lively rapids called Kukkolaforsen, part of the larger River Torne. The area has a long history of log-driving, war and smuggling, and four languages are spoken here: Swedish, Finnish, Sámi and Meänkieli – a minority language closely related to Finnish. Midsummer the sun is up all hours at midwinter it never rises.The tiny village of Kukkola is the unofficial sauna capital of Sweden. I warmly recommend a sweaty session in the village sauna, a large log cabin that can accommodate 65 fiery enthusiasts on three levels of long benches, heated by a large aggregate that holds 600kg of stone. Afterwards you can take a cooling dip in the stream, then head to the local inn for specialities like moose, gravadlax in a cup and coffee cheese with cloudberries.For a historic sauna experience, follow the river north a bit to the aromatic 300-year-old smoke sauna of Matkakoski – thought to be the oldest sauna in Sweden still in use. Nearby you can fish for whitefish and salmon and forage for berries and mushrooms. Jens Linder, chefVisitors are always impressed by Tallinn’s old town and fall in love with the local cuisine. But, when they venture out of the city they’re even more amazed by the open spaces, untouched nature, long empty beaches, and bus stops seemingly in the middle of nowhere.Estonia is small (about a fifth the size of the UK) and around half of the country is covered in forest, making it very easy to escape and not see another person. Approximately one-fifth is protected under its five national parks and nature reserves. A network of hiking trails crosses the country, quite literally off the beaten path. Lahemaa national park has a mix of forest, bog and seashore Kõrvemaa nature reserve is great for birdwatching and Soomaa national park is unique – it floods every year, so is only accessible by kayak.But my favourite national park is Matsalu, known for birdwatching – it is home to over 200 different species. In spring the trees come to life with the sound of thousands of birds chirping. The birdsong is indescribably beautiful it’s like a symphony and therapy for the soul. Like many Estonians, I have a country house that I escape to – mine is near Matsalu and has a hot tub and sauna for soaking in post-exploring.Kristina LuppBudapest has long been marked by grand cafes, pastry shops and, above all, by the Danube flowing between the steep hills of ancient Buda and the expensive villas of Pest on the other side, comprising a wild profusion of building styles.In the heart of Pest there is a small interior courtyard: 10 Magyar utca.You can cut through it by day, proceeding through the quiet Magyar utca gate, stepping over silent wooden cobbles, to the busy Múzeum körút. Built by Miklós Ybl in 1852, four years after the failure of the 1848 revolution and 15 years before the establishment of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the courtyard is an eclectic, beautifully proportioned, faintly Venetian blend of classic and romantic.Much of Budapest is empire grandeur under bombardment. This is not. There are spaces that hold you through colour, air, texture and proportion. The first time you see Giotto’s Pazzi Chapel in Florence, you feel it.If Budapest has a humane soul, it is something like this. You breathe differently here. You hope for more. George SzirtesOne of my favourite places in Bucharest is the National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC). It was here that I discovered avant-garde Romanian art, which has flourished ever since the 1970s, when dictator Nicolae Ceausescu stopped imposing the socialist-realist style.The museum is in the neoclassical Casa Poporului, or the Palace of the Parliament, the second-largest government building in the world after the Pentagon and the embodiment of Ceausescu’s ego and ambition: building it required an entire neighbourhood of about six square kilometres to be bulldozed and 57,000 families relocated.Getting to the museum is an adventure in itself, especially if you’re wearing high heels, as it’s a walk of a good seven minutes from the gates to the entrance.It’s not just the contrast with the totalitarian undertones of the Palace that sets MNAC apart. On the top-floor terrace of the museum, you can enjoy a glass of lemonade or an occasional gig, and take in the best view of Romania’s isive new People’s Salvation Cathedral, which cost the country about €400m. Paula ErizanuHook of Holland is an odd place to love. Go there and look south, and you’ll see one of the densest concentrations of industry in Europe: giant cranes, chimneys smoking like upturned cigars, and massive cargo ships rumbling their way from the Rhine into the North Sea. Yet head north and you’ll see something different: an arc of empty white sand stretching for miles. On a sunny day, you could almost be in Thailand.The appeal lies partly in the beach’s beauty, but also in the way it captures the spirit of the Netherlands: beautiful but industrious, peaceful but dynamic. It’s a crossroads where culture and history have always blended, like ingredients in a cocktail.I first came to the Hook a decade ago, soon after I moved to the Netherlands, when I lived just up the coast. Later, my wife and I were married in the sand dunes. Now, I come here often with our little daughter and watch her play in the waves. Sitting on the sand with a plate of fresh fish, we’re nearly as close to Essex as Maastricht. Britain feels tantalisingly close, yet also very far away.Ben Coates, author of The Rhine: Following Europe’s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps (John Murray Press, £9.99)If you’re a wise enough traveller to know that Slovenia is well worth a visit, then you’ll be sure to see the delightful capital, Ljubljana, and will doubtless head off to fairytale Lake Bled, dolloped by a church-topped island and with a Grimm castle looming on a clifftop above it.The question, then, is: what else you should see, beyond the Big Two attractions? My favourite place in my adopted homeland is the medieval town of Kamnik. Once a far more important city than Ljubljana, it was the feudal stronghold of the Bavarian Andechs clan, who made it a stop on trade routes between Budapest in the east and Venice to the west.Today the town boasts three castles, hiking trails close to the centre, an important rare books library, rich industrial heritage (the KIK factory here once produced much of the gunpowder for the Austro-Hungarian army and the Stol factory exported Thonet rocking chairs to the US), and may have the most microbreweries per capita in the world (six for a population of around 10,000). At the foot of the Kamnik-Savinja mountain range, it is also an ideal gateway to the sunny side of the Alps, a 10-minute drive from the Velika Planina mountain plateau , the closest you’ll get to Middle Earth in Middle Europe. Noah Charney, author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World’s Best CountryMy favourite place in Vienna – and indeed in Austria – is one that conjures up the most vivid image of the former multi-ethnic and multilingual western half of the Habsburg empire: the chamber of the former House of Commons (Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses) in the old Imperial Parliament (Reichsrat). It’s largely unused since the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 (except for the swearing-in of the president) miraculously, it also escaped wartime bombing.What is splendid and moving about it, aside from its size, beauty and sense of history, is the fact that representatives from almost all parts of the empire gathered there from 1883. German speakers from Austria itself and also from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Carniola and Bukovina, as well as Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Romanians and even one member of the Jewish National Party, all elected on the basis of universal male suffrage after 1907, met in this chamber. For all the linguistic chaos and political isions, the riotous and boisterous filibustering, the subterfuges and boycotts, it somehow functioned as the world’s first multinational parliament.In 1918 it became redundant and the inidual nations went their own way, leaving the leaders of the new Austrian Republic too few to fill the former Imperial Chamber. Subsequent decades saw conflict between many of the nations that had been part of Austria-Hungary, culminating in the Balkan wars of the 1990s this chamber is reminiscent of gentler times, when all nations of the monarchy – no matter their disagreements or even hatreds – were able to contain themselves in a usually civilised arena rather than resort to violence.The modern-day EU parliament, with its 705 MEPs representing 27 countries, is perhaps its heir, though it lacks its magic and gravitas.At the moment, the Imperial Parliament building is closed for rebuilding and refurbishment, and will remain so until 2021. The glorious former House of Commons chamber itself will undergo a mere clean-up and a few repairs, and will return to its full splendour.Christopher BrennanMO museum, which opened in October 2018, changed everything in Vilnius. Not only is it an incredible place for Lithuanian modern art, it’s also an example of new-wave Lithuanian philanthropy. The museum was funded by two Lithuanian scientists and designed by architects at Studio Libeskind. It’s a striking building, at the intersection of the old town and the city’s more recent westwards expansion.MO museum recently had a wildly successful exhibition called The Origin of Species: the 1990s DNA. I went four times, because it really was a way to relive our recent history – the wild 1990s, the starting point of capitalism in Lithuania, the foundation of our modern, democratic state.You could relive experiences such as trying on new jeans in winter while standing on a piece of cardboard in Gariūnai (the infamous open-air market 20 minutes outside Vilnius) buying one cigarette from a kiosk and watching movies on a VHS player.There are permanent exhibitions of Lithuanian modern art as well – my favourite painter is the postmodernist Šarūnas Sauka. The museum also has a boutique cinema, a cafe and a small shop full of great Lithuanian art, jewellery and books. At the moment, preparations are being made for a huge exhibition showcasing the works of cult British film director Peter Greenaway. Artificial rain is said to be part of the show’s experience. Neringa RekasiuteTwo or three times a week for the past 18 years, I have shopped in Barcelona’s Santa Caterina market. It’s a social event as much as a shopping expedition and not somewhere you can go in a hurry because there are always updates on children, illnesses, operations and deaths to be discussed. It has a very Mediterranean, familial vibe.I often have breakfast in the market bar, Bar Joan, a family affair run by Joan and his sons and daughters. They know their customers well and no sooner do I pull up a red vinyl stool than one of them is fixing me a café con leche and calling to the kitchen for a bikini (toasted ham and cheese). They also make a fine tortilla de patatas.One morning I sat next to a man who breakfasted on tripe and beer followed by a carajillo (coffee with a splash of cognac). Spanish men of a certain age often kick off the day with a hit of booze, frequently red wine. Even after living here for 20 years I can’t imagine drinking wine at 8am, which is probably just as well.Stephen BurgenIn Malta’s capital city there are more than 25 churches displaying incredible baroque paintings and architecture. In the oratory of the church of the Order of St John, which is a true gem of high baroque, there is a painting that I really admire and always moves me: Caravaggio’s Beheading of St John the Baptist.Included in the ’s list of the 10 greatest works of art ever, and once described as “the painting of the 17th century”, it is as alive now as it has ever been, and with a message that is still relevant: life and death, youth against old age, the contrast of colours, with light and dark captured by the astounding chiaroscuro technique of the eccentric genius. It reveals not only the story but the very self of the artist, and engulfs the observer in its theatrical action, sparking our emotions too.There are many historical sites to visit in Valletta – the Grand Master’s Palace, Casa Rocca Piccola (a “living” 16th-century palazzo), the Malta National Community Art Museum – but Caravaggio’s masterpiece is the one I always come back to. A visit to the cathedral and its oratory is by far the highlight of the Valletta experience.Fra Nikola Soukmandjiev, diplomat, priest and tour guideThe air is heavy with the scent of wild rosemary, sage and pine as I cycle along the path that skirts Lošinj’s north-western headlands.They call Lošinj “the island of vitality”, and this is more than mere marketing guff. Wild herbs blanket this long, spindly island that dangles into the Kvarner Gulf south of Rijeka, and the smell of them instantly gives me a lift during my meandering bike ride through the pines.Every now and then I park my bike and plunge into the impossibly clear water. I love the fact that the beaches that ring Lošinj are – like most of those in Croatia – pebbly rather than sandy. Some of them take a bit of effort to reach, usually involving a long hike down a rocky trail, if you don’t have your own boat.This all adds to the rough-and-ready ruggedness you get away from the big beach resorts. Simplicity is the key, and you can taste it in the grilled fish served at waterside restaurants and the giant rounds of bread baked under a cast-iron bell.It’s this gentle assault on all the senses that I appreciate every time I go to Croatia’s Adriatic coast – from the vivid blue-green of the sea to the heady fragrance of herbs and pine that have been baked in the heat. Total bliss.Mary NovakovichWhen democracy returned to Portugal in the spring of 1974, the Portuguese celebrated by throwing themselves into building a “modern” nation state (with the aid, later, of EU funding). While I love the bright lights and cosmopolitan vibe of Lisbon and Porto, it is the vestiges of “old” Portugal that really enchant me. To find them, just step into any neighbourhood pastelaria (cafe-bakery). You’ll find the day’s newspaper on a table, the footie on the TV and friends shooting the breeze over average-tasting but cheap (less than €1) café expressos.In Portugal, pastelarias double as repositories of local pride. Aside from the ubiquitous pastel de nata (the famous creamy custard tart, now available in M\u0026ampS), every self-respecting Portuguese town boasts its own speciality sweet. Cernache do Bonjardim has its almond cartuchos (shells) Castro Daire its bolo podre (literally, “rotten cake”) Chaves its meat-filled pastel.

Oliver BalchThe Midnight Sun Film Festival, established in 1986, enjoys a stellar reputation among cinephiles and moviemakers. A true celebration of the craft, the five-day festival skips the red carpets and invites the audience and acclaimed international directors to the small village of Sodankylä, in Finnish Lapland, to enjoy the round-the-clock feature film screenings each June, when the sun blazes above the horizon day and night.The programme ranges from premieres and rarities to classics and oddities, from silent films to karaoke singalong shows in a former circus tent. The morning discussion sessions with directors are a much-loved tradition, but not everybody makes it to those – the price of wrecking one’s circadian rhythm with high doses of sunshine.The laid-back atmosphere and lack of hierarchy encapsulate something of the Finnish propensity for happiness (Finland has topped the world’s “happy league” for the past two years). At an intimate festival whose whole ethos is to celebrate a love of cinema, one feels comfortable sharing a drink, a story or even a sauna with a random film buff or a world-famous film director – former guests include Francis Ford Coppola, Mike Leigh and Terry Gilliam.

Notably, his largest margins came in states with substantial black populations: Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina and Arkansas.The surge of momentum that led to him winning 10 of 14 states began last Saturday in the South Carolina primary, where Biden’s 30-point win was the result of his taking almost two-thirds of black votes there.In fact, to date, Biden has done what every successful Democratic nominee has done over the past 30 years: win the most black votes in every state. Every nominee, that is, with the exception, in 2004, of John Kerry, who finished three points behind his eventual running mate, John Edwards, in just one state.What does this all mean? Black voters, particularly in the South, changed the course of the Democratic primary. And it’s safe to say they will play an outsize role in deciding who wins the White House.Donald Trump and his campaign strategists are clearly aware of the pivotal role black voters will play in the election. It is no coincidence that in the past few months alone, the president has kicked off a Black Voices for Trump initiative in Atlanta, dedicated a considerable portion of his State of the Union address to the “bootstrapping black American”, and announced plans to open “community centers” in strategically targeted black communities in seven battleground states.Second, he is hoping to dampen black voters’ enthusiasm for the Democratic nominee and for the election overall. Based on recent voting patterns, for every 10 black voters who stay at home on election day, the Democratic nominee loses nine votes and Trump only loses one.Based on the results from Super Tuesday, the indication seems to be that black voters think Biden is the pragmatic choice and the safest bet. And the accompanying increased black turnout across the primary states bodes well for Democrats’ chances of winning the election this Fall.Theodore R Johnson is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0423aab395e588566738a55caff1665d0c06d2a/0_0_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859c5cd1b667f5bf12ceb9a64db043e3","title":"tell us how is coronavirus affecting your day to day life","story":"We want to hear about how coronavirus has impacted your daily life.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 6 March, the global death toll was 3,404, while more than 100,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 6,593 cases. More than 55,000 people in China have recovered from Covid-19.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8291b745d174ecd71245331e195c4db4af00de39/0_31_4727_2836/master/4727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85e56f66e9d3d97239815e44d600cec3","title":"facebook mask ad ban coronavirus","story":"Tech company will temporarily ban ads for medical face masks on the social network and Facebook marketplaceFacebook is temporarily banning advertisements for medical face masks as part of an effort to prevent use of its social media platform to exploit people’s concerns about the coronavirus outbreak.The ban covers advertisements on the social network as well as commercial listings on Facebook Marketplace, it’s peer-to-peer shopping facility, the company said.

It is his makeshift defence against coronavirus.“If I catch something I’m screwed,” explains the 23-year-old. “Gig economy workers can’t afford to be ill. My bank balance is literally £4 something right now.”Stephen – like tens of thousands of other couriers and drivers in the UK – is classed as self-employed and therefore not entitled to any sick pay. He stands to gain nothing from Boris Johnson’s pledge last Wednesday to give coronavirus-hit workers statutory sick pay from the first day off work rather than the fourth.Yet Stephen and other gig economy couriers could be called on to deliver food and other essentials to self-isolating households when the virus reaches its peak.Some industry analysts foresee the number of home deliveries doubling if people are told to work from home and avoid large gatherings under the government’s so-called social-distancing strategy, which will kick in if the virus continues to spread across the country.Unions representing gig economy workers, such as the GMB and Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), fear couriers with coronavirus symptoms may keep working. “Many will carry on because they need to put food on the table and pay the rent. They will then come into contact with other people and spread the virus,” says Mick Rix from the GMB, which represents thousands of couriers. “This would be going against everything the government is trying to achieve at the moment.”The GMB struck a deal last week with Hermes, under which 15,000 couriers will be paid normally if they have to stay at home. “We raised the lack of sick pay with them, and they immediately recognised it would be a problem,” he said. But he adds that Hermes is the only major courier company that has so far agreed to help workers confined to their homes.Jason Moyer-Lee, IWGB general secretary, welcomes the media’s renewed focus on the gig economy. “Precarious workers should not be losing out financially for following public health guidelines,” he says. “But this is a problem they have on a regular basis – they cannot take time off when they are sick or injured.”Back on the streets of London, drivers are doing what they can to limit new cases of coronavirus. Josh Lane (not his real name) jumps into his DPD Local van after making a delivery in Tottenham. He cleans his hands with hand sanitiser. “I’m in a rush, but I’m doing my bit,” he says through the rolled-down window.However, the 30-year-old cannot afford to stop work if he contracts the virus. “It’s like a flu and I’ve worked through flu before. If you’re self-employed you have to continue working,” he says. “It’s not about me. I’ve got three children. I’m not about to make them starve because of coronavirus. If I’m physically able to work, then isolation is not happening for me.”Lane claims that DPD has only been in touch to ask drivers to avoid travelling to the worst-affected countries. He admits continuing to drop packages might spread the virus. “That’s a risk I would have to take,” he adds.Other Deliveroo riders have been messaging Stephen. A Glasgow rider says she wouldn’t be able to afford to take time off: “I can barely take a day off as it is … I won’t be telling Deliveroo.” An Edinburgh rider says he would have to “work by taking precautions” if he fell ill as “universal credit … is five weeks away”. A Newcastle rider says “he wouldn’t be able to pay the bills” if he took time off.Unions scoff at Johnson’s claim that self-employed workers not entitled to statutory sick pay could apply for universal credit instead. Rix says affected gig economy couriers could not afford to wait for their first payment. “Many of these workers are on the breadline. They can’t wait five weeks and they won’t be able to go in for an assessment anyway because they will be self-isolated,” he says.DPD says it is looking at ways to provide additional support and will be making a further announcement shortly. “All DPD drivers have a choice of being employed directly by DPD, being on a worker contract, or being self-employed,” it adds. Deliveroo says it is considering offering financial support to affected riders in the UK.Riders like Stephen, however, could do with some reassurance now. “I delivered to a guy who was sweating buckets on Monday – I thought, ‘Shit, this is it,’” he says, checking his phone for his next job. “You’d think Deliveroo would want to keep their riders safe – and if they don’t, then the government should step in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ddc792adc7f16cf906e8537d9600757e7c6d86a/0_61_1850_1110/master/1850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b301f026a26a03dbb33a8554ab569e6","title":"italy democratic leader nicola zingaretti coronavirus","story":"Nicola Zingaretti is first leading Italian politician to test positive for the virusNicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy’s Democratic party, one of the national ruling parties, has tested positive for coronavirus.Zingaretti, who is also president of the Lazio region, made the announcement in a Facebook video.Zingaretti is the first leading Italian politician confirmed to have the disease.

The pair were allegedly plotting to oust King Salman and the son he has designated to succeed him, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, it reported.The New York Times also reported the detentions, adding that Prince Nayef’s younger brother Prince Nawaf bin Nayef had also been detained.Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The detentions mark the latest crackdown by the de facto ruler crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated his reign with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites.The crown prince, the king’s son, has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate in October 2018.Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy.In June 2017, the crown prince had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, to become heir to the Arab world’s most powerful throne.At the time, Saudi television channels showed the crown prince kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence.Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.“Prince Mohammed is emboldened – he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based Rand Corporation, said of the latest crackdown.“This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone – including royals – not to cross him.”The detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam’s holiest sites to contain the coronavirus outbreak.The kingdom has suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj – a key pillar of Islam.The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c26b193c1bf6771b0f83798a888ca115ad12f8/0_2_704_422/master/704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf7b185ddd83482130cb7e0585583731","title":"thousands held on cruise ship off united states scientists declare pandemic","story":"Warning after 21 test positive on liner, while in Spain police lock down blocks of flats and in China a quarantine hotel collapsesConcern was mounting yesterday for thousands of passengers – many elderly – on a cruise ship being held off San Francisco, after 21 people on board tested positive for coronavirus.US vice-president Mike Pence urged older Americans to “use caution” in planning cruise holidays in the near future, as he announced plans to bring the Grand Princess into a “non-commercial port” where all passengers and crew would be tested. Iniduals would be quarantined and treated as needed. There are more than 3,500 people, including 140 Britons, on the ship. Two of those who tested positive were passengers, while the other 19 were crew members.Pence’s low-key remarks contrasted starkly with the views of President Trump who has said he would prefer that cruise-ship passengers exposed to the virus be left on board so they don’t add to the number of total infections in the US. “I like the numbers being where they are,” he said. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”On board the Grand Princess, Jackie Bissell, from Dartford in Kent, said passengers had been given little information on what will happen next. “We are waiting for the ship’s captain, but I think he’s as much in the dark as we are and he has said he’s only giving us information as and when he gets it,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The news of the plight of the passengers on the Grand Princess – sister ship of the Diamond Princess, the cruise liner which suffered its own deadly coronavirus outbreak while moored off Japan – came as fears grew for more than 150 people on another cruise ship, in quarantine in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor. Last night authorities said a further 33 people had tested positive for the virus, on top of 12 already confirmed.The total number of cases of infections around the world has topped six figures and on Saturday stood at 105,479. The global death toll has reached 3,555. The World Health Organization (WHO) called the spread of the virus “deeply concerning”, but continues to resist describing the outbreak as a pandemic, to the fury of senior scientists.Researchers say the virus that was first identified in China is now spreading freely in four regions, has reached every continent but Antarctica, and its advance seems unavoidable. “I think it’s pretty clear we’re in a pandemic and I don’t know why WHO is resisting that,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at Minnesota University. Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, agreed. This outbreak meets all the definitions for a pandemic, she said.In China, around 70 people were trapped on Saturday after a five-storey hotel being used for coronavirus quarantine collapsed in the port city of Quanzhou. A total of 34 people have so far been rescued as workers in orange overalls clamber over mounds of rubble in search of other survivors. It is believed people were using the hotel as a quarantine centre as prescribed by local regulations after they had returned from Hubei province, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak.In Spain, police reported they were preparing to lock down entire blocks of flats after dozens of coronavirus cases were traced to a funeral held in the Basque country two weeks ago. Spain has so far confirmed 430 cases of the virus – 60 of which originated among people who attended the funeral service in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz with most concentrated in the nearby towns of Haro and Casalarreina.Local authorities said police would be “reinforcing home isolation controls” in Haro and limiting access to the town’s health centre. “We need to take exceptional measures designed to stop the transmission of the illness,” said the regional health minister, Sara Alba. The death toll from the virus in Spain currently stands at 10.In France, seven more people have died, bringing its toll to 16. France now has 716 confirmed cases, a jump of 103 from Friday, while in Italy Nicola Zingaretti, leader of Italy’s co-ruling Democratic party, revealed he had tested positive. With 4,636 registered cases, Italy lies behind only China, South Korea and Iran in terms of numbers of infected people.In addition, on Saturday Pope Francis cancelled his main public appearances to avoid crowds in St Peter’s Square. The pontiff, 83, also cancelled a Lent retreat for the first time in his papacy, though the Vatican stressed he was suffering only from a cold that was unrelated “to other pathologies”.I n Palestine, 15 Americans suspected of being exposed to coronavirus during a trip to the Holy Land are now in quarantine near Bethlehem and are coordinating with US and Palestinian authorities to try to get home. “It was going to be the trip of a lifetime,” Chris Bell, 42, lead pastor of the 3Circle Church in Fairhope, Alabama, told Reuters from the Angel Hotel, in Beit Jala, which is next to Bethlehem.The Angel Hotel was the first area of coronavirus concern in the Bethlehem area. After several of its workers tested positive this week, the Palestinian Authority put restrictions on foreign tourist travel and later declared a 30-day state of emergency. The measures have effectively shut down the city. Elsewhere in the West Bank, Palestinian security forces staffed checkpoints and turned foreigners away, while schools, colleges, kindergartens and national parks were ordered to remain closed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ae90602675ec8fe3537c37b172c3927e061ee3/0_293_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e76e396a5e59846715c0017113edab","title":"uk coronavirus total infected covid 19 passes 200","story":"Number increases from 164 cases confirmed on Friday, after more than 21,000 tested for the virusThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has risen to more than 200, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed.In total, 206 people had tested positive for Covid-19 as of 7am on Saturday, an increase of 42 from 164 cases confirmed on Friday.

However the UK remains in the “containment” phase of tracing coronavirus cases to prevent it spreading in the community, England’s deputy chief medical officer has said.Jennie Harries told the BBC on Saturday that a decision about the next phase of delaying the spread of the virus would depend on how fast the number of cases rose.The government’s battle plan says of the “delay” phase: “Action that would be considered could include population-distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible.”On Friday, it was confirmed that a man in his early 80s had become the second person to die in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus. The man, who had underlying health conditions, died on Thursday while being treated at Milton Keynes University hospital.The previous evening, another patient, reported to be a woman in her 70s, became the first person in the UK to die after being diagnosed with Covid-19 while at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading.NHS England has confirmed it will provide GP surgeries with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help them deal with the coronavirus outbreak. In a letter sent to all 7,000 English GP surgeries on Thursday, NHS England made clear it is giving every surgery a full supply of PPE gear, which will help keep staff who come into contact with suspected coronavirus cases safe and help to minimise the spread of the virus.The move follows complaints by GPs and the British Medical Association that practices are ill-equipped to deal with the outbreak.On Friday, GP surgeries were told by NHS England to start conducting as many remote consultations as possible, replacing patient visits with phone, video, online or text contact.More than 20 GP practices have been forced to close temporarily over concerns about the spread of coronavirus.Boris Johnson will chair a Cobra civil contingencies committee on Monday as officials prepare to accelerate work on the delay phase of the government’s plan.Sports governing bodies and broadcasters have also been called to a government meeting on Monday to discuss how to handle the possible impact of the outbreak on the sporting calendar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c94c4b275d546d952afb01f72d069ef1ca166e5/0_51_1299_779/master/1299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99a1983dd98cbc53020d3c5d86071c9f","title":"uk withdraw eu aviation safety regulator","story":"Transport secretary says senior figures will gradually return to UK as regulatory powers revert to CAAThe UK is to withdraw from the European Union aviation safety regulator (EASA) after the Brexit transition period, Grant Shapps has confirmed.The transport secretary said many of the most senior figures at the organisation headquartered in Cologne, Germany were British and that they would gradually return to the UK throughout this year as regulatory powers reverted to the Civil Aviation Authority.“As you would expect from an independent nation, we can’t be subject to the rules and laws made by somebody else, so we can’t accept rules from the EU commission and we can’t accept rulings in terms of court cases from the European court of justice or anybody else, any more than the US would,” he told Aviation Week in Washington.The Tory MP added that the UK would seek to be “particularly forward-leaning” in the technology and automation sectors. “We’ll make sure our legislative framework is in a great place to enable those kinds of organisations to excel in the UK market,” he said.The aerospace trade body ADS, which represents more than 1,100 UK businesses, said the decision could put high-skilled jobs at risk.“We have been clear that continued participation in EASA is the best option to maintain the competitiveness of our £36bn aerospace industry and our access to global export markets,” the chief executive, Paul Everitt, said.He added that British influence in EASA helps raise global aviation standards and fosters collaboration with international partners. “Government had promised it would consider harmonisation where it is in the UK interest and will be led by the evidence on the future of aviation safety regulation,” he said.“We are disappointed that it has not taken a more ambitious approach. It is essential that it works with us to deliver a regime that does not put jobs at risk in an industry that employs 111,000 people in highly skilled roles across the UK.”A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Being a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency is not compatible with the UK having genuine economic and political independence. We will maintain world-leading safety standards for industry, with the Civil Aviation Authority taking over these responsibilities, and will continue to work with colleagues in the EU to establish a new regulatory relationship.”The spokesperson added that the EU had been clear the UK would no longer be able to participate in the EASA but that the bloc had indicated a willingness to agree a bilateral aviation safety agreement.“Given we have broadly the same starting position on aviation safety with the EU, we have an opportunity to provide early certainty to industry on the terms of our new regulatory relationship,” they said.On its website, EASA has said the UK will not take part in any decision-shaping activities during the transition period, which ends on 31 December. However, it can be extended by up to two years if the EU and UK agree jointly on a delay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6c51af39939e25805f0a8c71bd3560d5dc0d3ea/0_1991_4644_2786/master/4644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9241cee33a2993f914c2e20ea4cb9868","title":"we have a no politics rule how families can heal their brexit rifts","story":"Now Britain has left the EU, the fractures remain. Is it possible to bury the political hatchet?A bigoted old bastard: that’s how Letitia Clark thought of her dad, Tony, when she found out he had voted to leave. She worked in a restaurant, where many of her colleagues were EU migrants, and was dating an Italian. “He disappeared for a while,” she says of her father. “I think it was a wish to avoid conflict.”The vote played a significant role in Letitia’s decision to move with her then boyfriend to Sardinia, where she still lives and has written a cookbook, Bitter Honey, about Sardinian cuisine. She and her two brothers – a journalist in Cape Town, and a captain in the Royal Marines who travels all over the world – lead very different lives from Tony’s in quiet, rural Devon.Tony gets a good shoeing over Brexit whenever they see each other, most recently at Christmas. “We have so little time together as a family anyway, it seems a shame to focus on the things we don’t agree on,” Letitia says. Tony, 70, agrees: “I would never actually fall out with family or friends about it. You shrug your shoulders and get on with it.” He and his daughter share an inability to take themselves too seriously, and clearly love each other very much.Yet we all have to live together on these little islands, so how can we begin to find a way forward? What strategies are people using to address conflict with loved ones?Laughing about it has helped James, 32, from Maidstone, defuse conflicts that arose as a result of his leave vote. Most of his friends voted to remain. “It’s usually in the pub. Some of them take it personally, like I’ve attacked their sense of being, when I really haven’t. I decided to vote that way because I didn’t think there was any accountability in Europe,” he says. He found social media especially hard. “I was called an idiot, a racist, and accused of not knowing what I’m talking about. I don’t mind if you disagree with me, but it was the language used.”Then, about a year ago, a girl he had been talking to on a dating app ghosted him because he had voted leave. “All my friends, even my remainer friends, found it hilarious. That sort of brought us together. You get some perspective, realise that politics isn’t the be-all and end-all,” he says. James says the election did momentarily reignite tensions. “Now, when I go out with friends, we have a no-politics rule. It has got a lot better. They have been a lot less argumentative now that Brexit has happened.”Olivia Whelan, 38, from London, has reached the “resignation” phase: “I can’t have the same argument over and over with people.” Having studied in Germany and worked there for a decade, she was dismayed by the result and by the fact that her parents – who had lived in Spain for seven years – voted to leave. “When I found out, I was very upset. I found it very difficult for that whole first year to talk about anything else, especially with my dad, who had told my mum how to vote.”But she has come to understand her parents’ reasons for voting leave. “They really did think there would be that £350m a week for the NHS.” She is now, “amazingly”, dating a man who voted leave, which she says would have been unthinkable 18 months ago. They first went on a date in 2017, but ended up screaming at each other about Brexit. “I felt quite sad. I was still so angry and all I could see was that, if you voted for that, you must be terrible, your politics must be terrible, you must hate this country. I couldn’t see past it at all.”Has Olivia been through a grieving process of sorts, and come out the other side? “Yes, life has to go on. We have to find a way to live together after this.” Whether the harmony with her parents and her partner will continue, she doesn’t know. It depends what happens politically. “It’s calm at the moment, but if things get hairy again, I’m going to find it quite difficult.”Alison, 75, a British citizen who lives in Portugal, doesn’t know anyone else in her community of expats who voted to leave and, while her husband didn’t vote, he was pro-remain. “I was subjected to a constant barrage of criticism,” she says. “I frequently felt bullied, sidelined and isolated. I love Europe. I’ve always travelled in Europe. It’s the EU I don’t like.”Things have calmed down a little since the election, but it is clear from talking to Alison that she is still hurt. “I can stand up for myself and make my reasons known. But if you’re totally alone in that argument with no support from anybody else, it’s intimidating.”What about her husband? “We argue every time we watch the news,” she sighs. “You can’t orce your husband because of different political views. We’re fine.” It doesn’t sound fine – how does she think things will progress? “I’m not sure. We’re in a bit of a limbo at the moment. I think more war could break out.”There’s something particularly British about many of the stories I heard from families trying to resolve Brexit conflict, after a callout on the  website. Many of them were simply burying it. Does banning politics as a conversation topic simply repress negative emotions until a later date? Or does it allow people the time and space to focus on what unites them?One person struggling with a politics moratorium is James Turner, 41, from Buckinghamshire. James, who voted remain, and his family live close to his wife’s parents and siblings, and their families, who all voted leave. Brexit sparked conversations that shook his understanding of the people he thought he knew. “I couldn’t believe how emotional I found it,” he says. “When that leaks into family dynamics, it’s really hard.”A lack of communication following several disagreements has left James second-guessing his own feelings. “It occurred to me that it might not even be an issue to them, they might not have even realised how much it has affected me,” he says. This isn’t simply a difference of opinion, though, but extreme right ideologies. What would help James move forward? “Just a conversation that would go a long way to making me feel better about it. I’ve tried so hard to make that happen. But everyone seems terrified of engaging.”Ana, 43, lives in London, and is Spanish-Italian. She has lived in the UK since she was 15, when her anglophile parents sent her to study. She stayed, marrying a Briton who had been raised in Spain, and they have two children, aged eight and 12. When her mother-in-law and husband voted for Brexit, she felt betrayed. “I feel Brexit has been a validation for people expressing anti-immigration feelings,” she says. Pete, 37, who is British and lives in Germany, wept at the Brexit result – voted for by both his parents and their respective partners. It sent him down a long and stressful path towards German citizenship. He became snappy and withdrawn with his mother. “I resented her for what I saw as her supporting people who were working against my way of life, causing chaos for my friends and family, and stripping people in Britain and in the EU of important rights,” he says. What helped was channelling his energy into remain causes and working on his own responses. “I have made personal efforts to change my thinking, and I have the impression she has, too. I am lucky that both my parents are still here, and I want to have enjoyable times with them, and appreciate the good things about our relationship.”Simon, 48, from Solihull, was the first in his family to go to university. He voted remain. He told me how his Brexit-voting father had called him a “liberal elite” and he had called his father “a fucking stupid builder” during years of beer-fuelled arguments in the pub. “For a while, I was using all the hard data. I’d print out arguments with experts and statistics. He’d look at them, but it took me years to realise that it wasn’t the data that was going to change his mind. He hadn’t used reason to get to that position he just wanted out.”What was a logical question to him, Simon realised, was an emotional one for his dad. “It became clear that we were on different wavelengths. If your criteria are completely different then you could be speaking a different language.” But, Simon says, it would never have got to the point where father and son stopped speaking.When Simon wrote to me in January, his father was very ill he died before the month was out. Despite their political differences, the men were close. “As I used to say, ‘Dad, you are a complete arse but I love you.’ Him being ill crystallised the whole thing: some things are more important than politics. Ultimately, this is just an argument in the pub – it’s not going to change how we feel about each other.”Some names have been changedWe tend to make presumptions about the wider set of values other people hold on the basis of one or two that are salient. This is particularly evident post-Brexit. People assume that a person’s stance on Europe is a reliable indicator of all sorts of other values, often negative. Healing requires recognising the complexity of our value systems, and that holding a single view you find intolerable is consistent with holding any number of other values you share.Julian BagginiI usually prefer to avoid seeing a orce as a place where you win or lose. As a lawyer who deals with matters involving a high level of emotions, my number one priority is to keep my clients focused on the desired outcome, instead of seeking cheap wins and ego boosts. In the context of Brexit, the comparison should be that of a orce with children, where the best interest of the child should always come first. It is my job to help people see beyond the emotional hurt and seek common groun1d on which to build a future for themselves, unburdened by past hurts, as well as for their children. With Brexit, things are similar: accepting the new reality, and finding common ground with those who have chosen a different path to the one we would have preferred, is the only way forward.Rakhi SingalIf you’ve fallen out with someone over your views on Brexit, and want to get your relationship back on track, talk – ideally face-to-face. Say you know you have had your differences recently, but you’re still familyfriendspartners and your relationship is important to you. You don’t have to come round to their way of thinking, but you will need to agree to disagree and draw a line under it. If the other person is ready to move forward, try talking through some of the things that you do agree on, and looking back at some of the good times you’ve shared. Keep in mind that you are two different people with unique perspectives – it’s just that the polarisation around Brexit has made these differences more visible. Difference can be a good thing – it’s how you manage it that counts.Peter Saddington, at RelateGet perspective: trying to understand where someone else is coming from is tough but helpful. Try to see things through their lens. If you can understand their starting point, you will be in a better position to come up with solutions that give them some of what they want. This is critical to being able to move forward – if you are offering them nothing, don’t expect them to agree. Learn what triggers negative reactions in you – is there a specific point of disagreement that winds you up? Whatever it is, identify it and practise staying calm when thinking about it, or experiencing it.

Thanks for joining me.Here’s a summary of the news so far today: The family of the 83-year-old man who died after testing positive for coronavirus have paid tribute to him in a statement released on Saturday afternoon.Here’s the full story from the UK:More than 1,200 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy since Friday, the Civil Protection Agency said.The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy has risen to 5,883 from 4,636 on Friday, according to official figures, a rise of 1,247.The death toll in the country rose to 233 from 197 on Friday.The head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, said in a news conference that of those originally infected, 589 had fully recovered while 567 were being treated in intensive care. In total there are now 5,061 current cases (this figure doesn’t include those who have died or those who have recovered.)The outbreak in Italy, which began over two weeks ago, is focused on a handful of hotspots in the north, but cases have now been confirmed in each of the country’s 20 regions, with deaths recorded in eight of them. A second member of France’s National Assembly has been taken to hospital after contracting coronavirus and five other lawmakers are being tested for the illness, the lower house’s presidency said in a statement on Saturday.The Assembly did not name the two legislators who have caught the disease, but local media in the eastern region of Alsace have reported that the first of the two lawmakers is Jean-Luc Reitzer, who represents one of the departments most affected by the outbreak and is currently in intensive care, Reuters reports.The second lawmaker is a woman, according to the statement by the parliament. The Assembly said on Friday that a snack bar worker had also contracted the virus.Sessions in the lower house will be interrupted for two weeks from 9 March and 22 March due to municipal elections that are taking place across France, reducing activity and the number of people present in the building, the assembly said.France’s health ministry said earlier that two more people had died from the coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to 11 people.France now has 716 confirmed cases of coronavirus, an increase of 103 compared with a day earlier.Italy’s premier football league, Serie A, could be forced to suspend mid-season if a player tests positive for coronavirus, the Italian football federation (FIGC) said on Saturday.“We must be realistic,’’ Gabriele Gravina, president of the FIGC, said in an interview with Italian broadcaster Rai, “We need to take measures to protect athletes, and we cannot exclude the possibility to suspend the competition if a player tested positive.’’On Wednesday, Italy ordered that all sporting events should be played behind closed doors until 3 April due to the outbreak.The ”derby of Italy” between Inter Milan and Juventus football clubs is set to be played on Sunday, while the Rome marathon, due to take place on 29 March, has been cancelled due to the outbreak. “This is the message that we would never have wished to write but sadly, as a consequence of the ongoing health emergency and according to what is laid down in the cabinet decree of March 4, 2020, the Marathon on March 29 has been cancelled,” said organisers.Italy is the European country most affected by the coronavirus with 3,916 infected and 197 dead.Iran’s death toll climbed to 145 on Saturday after another 21 people were confirmed to have died, as infections in the country increased to nearly 6,000.Announcing the latest deaths from the virus, a health ministry official said in a televised briefing that the tally of confirmed infections had increased by more than 1,000 during the last 24 hours, totalling 5,823 by Saturday, Reuters reported. On Friday, the country’s confirmed cases were reported to be 4,747.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, called in a tweet for world opposition to US sanctions, which he said were draining Iran’s resources, needed in the fight against the outbreak.A second confirmed case of Covid-19 has been recorded in Cornwall.Steve Brown, Cornwall council’s deputy director of public health, told PA Media: “The case is a resident directly linked to the initial diagnosis in Cornwall, who had also travelled to northern Italy.“I’d like to reassure people again that the risk to the general public remains low and Cornwall council is working with health colleagues to do everything we can to stop the virus spreading and ensure the people of Cornwall are protected.“If you have not been contacted by Public Health England as a close contact of the confirmed cases you do not need to take any action at this time.”Public Health England is also contacting people who had close contact with a resident of Leicestershire, one of the latest confirmed cases of Covid-19.Fu-Meng Khaw, the centre director at Public Health England East Midlands, said: “Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case.“This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.”The Premier League handshake ban has kicked in today, with various players seen bumping fists or elbows instead, or even completely avoiding a physical greeting.Sam Jones in MadridPolice are preparing to lock down entire blocks of a neighbourhood in a small town in northern Spain after dozens of cases of the coronavirus were traced back to a funeral two weeks ago.Spain has so far confirmed 430 cases of the virus – 60 of which originated among people who attended a funeral service in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, according to Spain’s National Microbiology Centre.Thirty-nine of those 60 cases are in the neighbouring La Rioja region, according the local government, with most of them concentrated in the towns of Haro and Casalarreina. About another 25 cases are reported to have been confirmed in the Basque country.Although only six people in the region are being treated in hospital, the authorities said police would be “reinforcing home isolation controls” in Haro and limiting access to the town’s health centre.Greek Cypriot police fired pepper spray on Saturday after skirmishes broke out with protesters angry about a closed checkpoint on the ethnically-split island, according to witnesses.Authorities said the closure was a precaution against coronavirus, Reuters reports.Cyprus announced the temporary closure of four checkpoints on the ided island on 28 Feb, the first closure since border crossings were opened in 2003 after decades of estrangement.Witnesses said a group of people on the Turkish Cypriot side turned out in support of peace activists on the other side of the barricade calling for the checkpoint in the capital Nicosia to open. When open, it is used by hundreds of people every day.“People were holding olive branches, and at some stage it appears someone started pushing,” a witness at the gathering on the Turkish Cypriot side told Reuters. “Greek Cypriot police pushed back and at that moment it appeared they used pepper spray.”In a statement, Cyprus police said they made limited use of teargas to prevent demonstrators breaking a police cordon. Stones were also thrown at police, the statement said.The Italian Democratic party leader, Nicola Zingaretti, in a video about his own Covid-19 diagnosisMy colleague Nicola Slawson has written a story about a letter that was sent to over 7,000 GP surgeries in England, informing them that NHS England will provide personal protective equipment to help staff deal with the coronavirus outbreak."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing.

Photograph: Thomas SampsonAFP via Getty Images.The number of confirmed coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in the State has risen to 19, after the virus was identified in a male in the east of Ireland on Saturday. “The HSE is working rapidly to identify any contacts the patient may have had, to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread,” it said in a statement. The emergency team met on Saturday to consider guidance from an expert advisory group on managing healthcare workers who are in close contact with confirmed cases of the virus. It said it had decided to accept the advice, which was provided in response to the recent diagnosis of Covid-19 in a patient hospitalised at Cork University Hospital. The patient had a significant number of close contacts with healthcare workers and Dr Cillian de Gascun, chairwoman of the advisory group, said there was “a risk to patients of acquiring Covid-19 from an exposed healthcare worker”. The advice noted that if a health facility cannot be staffed safely to provide critical services, those who have had close contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus and have developed symptoms should be excluded from work. Essential workersIt added that staff who have not developed symptoms, and are deemed essential workers, may continue to work provided they observe infection prevention and control precautions, and undergo active monitoring twice daily for 14 days after contact with a confirmed case. Under current coronavirus response plans, it is expected that patients with mild symptoms will recover in isolation in the community, rather than in hospital, where all cases are being treated at present. Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer in the Department of Health, said coronavirus creates a risk to patient care in two ways: “The risk of transmission from an infected health care worker and the risk of serious impact on patient care by loss of significant numbers of essential staff.” He said the expert group’s guidance would “be implemented in Cork University Hospital and Limerick Hospital immediately” and that Health Service Executive senior management was meeting with staff in the affected hospitals, offering guidance. The HSE on Saturday said there would be “no barriers” to the recruitment of health service staff needed to work in response to the coronavirus outbreak. A HSE spokeswoman said the organisation was also “expediting all other avenues” in terms of those on panels and awaiting appointment and that those who have left the service for reasons of retirement, career break, secondments were also being identified and contacted.“The HSE will ensure that every method of engaging staff that are required for managing services at this time are maximised and we will not fall short in this regard,” she added. “The efforts of all our staff and stakeholders at this time is fully acknowledged.”‘Much earlier’Phil Ní Sheaghdha, general secretary of Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, told RTÉ radio that the move was welcome “but it should have happened much earlier”. The National Maternity Hospital, on Dublin’s Holles Street, said it had applied visitor restrictions due to concerns about potential spread of the virus.Hospitals in Cork and the midwest, and Dublin’s Mater hospital, where cases are being treated, have also introduced visitor restrictions and many elective surgeries have been cancelled. Private nursing homes across the State have also restricted visiting to minimise risk to “vulnerable” older residents.Staff at some Irish hospitals are expected to be trained in order to provide regional coronavirus testing facilities. The National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin processes all tests. Other health service staff are to be drafted in to assist the 60 or so public health professionals who specialise in tracing contacts of people with infectious diseases. The requirement for contact tracing has escalated hugely since the number of cases grew in recent days.International data shows four out of every five people who get the disease suffer mild symptoms. The number of people infected with coronavirus has passed 102,000 globally, the World Health Organisation said on Saturday. Ms Ní Sheaghdha also criticised the decision to go ahead with big St Patrick’s Day celebrations around the country over coming weeks, warning it would “put too much strain on our public health service.”“After any mass gathering our hospitals and A\u0026ampE departments are overwhelmed,” she said. “We know this, we know not just from the point of view of the coronavirus but for general activity at mass gatherings.” However, organisers of St Patrick’s Day parades in the Co Cork towns of Youghal, Cobh and Midleton have announced they will cancel their event this year. Meanwhile, testing of patients in Northern Ireland has resulted in three new presumptive positive results for coronavirus, bringing the total to seven since testing began.Further positive tests had been expected and the advice to the public remains unchanged. Northern Ireland is still in the containment phase, according to the Department of Health.The latest three cases are all adults who had recently travelled from Italy and are linked to a previously confirmed positive case.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"HSE says there will be \u0026lsquono barriers\u0026rsquo to health recruitment in response to outbreakThree pairs of fighters scramble during the early morning approach of Russian aircraftOne of two men detained in Co Roscommon since removed from State, Garda saysPair among several men held after 10 people found being trafficked near Ghent, BelgiumVaradkar says Trump\u0026rsquos acting chief of staff understands \u0026lsquoall the key issues in detail\u0026rsquoThere is space for \u0026lsquocivilised, rational, evidence-based discussions\u0026rsquo, says Stephen FarryNational Maternity Hospital annouces visitor restriction in effort to curb spread of Covid-19Ex-Amnesty chief says today\u0026rsquos problems will seem like a \u0026lsquopicnic\u0026rsquo in future if climate change not addressedActions part of mid-term review of National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 \u0026ndash 2021Christopher Robinson convicted over 2016 car bomb attack on Adrian Ismay (52)Mass-goers struggle to ditch the habit of dipping fingers into holy water fonts \u0026ndash despite HSE warningsDay centre in Roscommon does best to juggle safety with the good spirits of its visitorsNew grassroots group in Fianna F\u0026aacuteil is opposing moves by Martin to form coalition with Fine GaelCourt found Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum ordered abduction of two of his daughtersFormer president warns price of political inaction will be substantial fines for IrelandJoan Huber (53), originally from Kerry, found dead after apparent murder-suicideState\u0026rsquos chief medical officer says chance of picking up disease remains very lowStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195611.1583533076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus testing to rise sharply in ireland as treatment streamlined","story":"The number of coronavirus cases is due to increase in Ireland.

Photograph: Michael CooperPA WireThe testing of people for coronavirus and the treatment of confirmed cases is to be streamlined as the number of Covid-19 diagnoses continues to rise here.Another five positive tests for the disease – three women and two men – were announced last night, with Northern Ireland also recording another case.This brings to 18 the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the Republic and four in the North.It is planned that patients with mild symptoms will recover in isolation in the community, rather than in hospital, where all cases are being treated at present.International data shows four out of every five people who get the disease suffer mild symptoms. The number of people infected with coronavirus is nearing 100,000 across the globe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday.Staff at some Irish hospitals will be be trained to provide testing facilities regionally, it is expected. The National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin currently processes all tests. Up to last week, almost 400 people had been tested, but this number is expected to have risen sharply when new figures are published early next week.Other health service staff are to be drafted in to assist the 60 or so public health professionals who specialise in tracing contacts of people with infectious diseases. The requirement for contact tracing has escalated hugely since the number of cases grew in recent days.Three of the new cases in the Republic are in the south of the country, one is in the east and one in the west.One case is associated with travel from northern Italy, and one with close contact with a confirmed case. A third case involves a healthcare worker who was in close contact with a confirmed case.The last two new cases involve a male who travelled from abroad and a female who travelled from northern Italy. The country the man travelled to Ireland from is not one of the high-risk areas and the case remains under investigation.Containment phaseThe State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan described 18 as “a small number of cases” and pointed out that the origins of all but one could be explained.“We are still in a containment phase and the chance of picking up this disease remains very low.”Hospitals in Cork and the midwest, and Dublin’s Mater hospital, where cases are being treated, have introduced visitor restrictions and many elective surgeries have been cancelled. Private nursing homes across the State have also restricted visiting to minimise risk to “vulnerable” older residents.Trinity College Dublin, which has one confirmed case among its student body, has introduced a ban on entering the college for 14 days for staff and students returning from northern Italy or other high-risk areas.Ireland’s fifth round Six Nations clash away to France on March 14th will go ahead, the French Rugby Federation confirmed.

Photograph: GettyItaly is set to lock down its wealthiest and most populous region, which includes the financial capital Milan, as part of tough new measures expected to be approved on Saturday to contain the coronavirus outbreak.The new rules include telling people not to enter or leave Lombardy, which is home to some 10 million people, as well as 11 provinces in four of Italy’s 19 other regions, according to a draft decree. All museums, gyms, cultural centres, ski resorts and swimming pools will be shut in the targeted areas, according to the decree, which is due to come into force from Sunday.The latest move to contain the outbreak comes after the number of infections jumped by more than 1,200 in the past 24 hours. So far, only a few limited areas of northern Italy, known as “red zones”, have been quarantined.Leave will be cancelled for all healthcare workers, weddings, funerals and sports events suspended, and home working should be adopted as much as possible. The 11 provinces affected are those around Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini in the region of Emilia-Romagna – Venice, Padua and Treviso in the region of Veneto, Asti and Alessandria in Piedmont and the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the central region of Marche.All schools and universities will be closed in Lombardy and the listed provinces until at least April 3rd. This week, the government announced schools all over the country would be closed until March 15.Additional measures will apply across the country, with nightclubs closed as well as pubs and betting halls, and bans on parties and public events.In the United States major US pro sports leagues are considering a ban on media and other non-necessary personnel from team locker rooms, according to sources.The leagues are discussing adopting the proposal as a unified front, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations aren’t public.The move stops short of some of the more extreme measures that some leagues worldwide have imposed, such as cancelling games or holding competitions with no spectators.In FranceMost big US sporting events are still going ahead as planned. The National Collegiate Athletic Association reaffirmed on Friday that games shouldn’t be cancelled, and Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia said this week the Masters tournament will be played next month.In France virus cases jumped by 233, bringing the total to 949, according to director general of health Jerome Salomon. The number of deaths linked to the virus rose to 16 from 11, he added. A third member of France’s lower house has been diagnosed with the virus and hospitalised, the National Assembly said in a statement. The female MP has is receiving treatment in hospital. Another five politicians and one employee are being tested. French MPs are scheduled to break from March 9th through March 22nd, a recess unrelated to the outbreak.In Saudi Arabia schools will shut for two weeks to avoid the spread of Covid-19, according to the state-run SPA news agency. Saudi education authorities will activate a remote education initiative, the agency added.Italy’s total fatalities climbed to 233, with total cases increasing to 5,883, the third-highest in the world after China and South Korea. Civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said the biggest one-day jump in infections included more than 300 cases from a Lombardy region laboratory in the town of Brescia that had not been counted previously.Italy is poised to announce sweeping measures including extending quarantine areas to deal with the virus after the death toll surged by about a third. The number of fatalities over the past two weeks has risen to 197, with infections growing by 78 to 4,636, the fourth-highest after China, South Korea and Iran. One case was diagnosed in the Vatican. Nicola Zingaretti, the head of the country’s democratic party, said on Facebook that he had tested positive for the virus.Deaths in Italy rank second in the world, behind more than 3,000 in China, where the virus emerged more than two months ago.In PortugalIn answer to a question, the governor advised elderly residents to avoid attending gatherings with large numbers of people.Hungary’s government cancelled a rally planned for the March 15th national holiday in central Budapest. The number of confirmed coronavirus patients in Hungary has increased to five since the first infections were announced on Wednesday.Officials from Sweden and Portugal warned that the outbreak will get worse. The epidemic “will have a major impact at the global level”, said Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in Lisbon following a meeting with his Portuguese counterpart. “In Sweden, we do have plans for a worse scenario than we have today.”In Portugal, “it’s highly probable that the number of infected people will continue to increase in the next few days,” said prime minister Antonio Costa. The government has so far confirmed 13 cases in the country.Malta confirmed its first infection in a 12-year-old girl who had visited northern Italy, the Associated Press reported, citing health minister Chris Fearne. The girl was tested on Friday and results came back positive early Saturday.

Photograph: US Coast GuardHandout via Reuters.A small number of Irish people people are on board a coronavirus-hit cruise ship that is stuck off the coast of California. A total of 21 people on the Grand Princess have so far tested positive for Covid-19, just under half of all those who have been tested. Nineteen of those diagnosed are crew members on the ship, which has more than 3,500 people on board including four Irish people and 140 Britons. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: “The consulate in San Francisco is in touch with local authorities and monitoring the situation closely. “It is the department’s policy in providing consular assistance that commentary is not given on inidual cases and the people or families involved.”US vice-president Mike Pence said on Friday that the Grand Princess would be directed to a non-commercial port. Among those onboard is Co Donegal native Pat Kelly, who is the second officer on the cruiser. Mr Kelly is from Moville and only left the town a month ago to return to sea having spent Christmas and the New Year there. He trained at the National Maritime College in Ringaskiddy, Cork.A local source said Mr Kelly has been in touch with his family and friends in Co Donegal to let them now that he is in good health.“He is fine and he has been in touch by phone to reassure his family of that,” the source said.“Pat is young but he is a very experienced seaman and has been at sea all of his life. He has risen through the ranks quickly. This is just another challenge he will take on board and get on with it.”A British passenger on board the ship told BBC Radio 4 that she booked a space on the Grand Princess to mark her 70th birthday. Jackie Bissell, from Dartford in Kent, said passengers were told on Thursday that there might be something wrong.“We had a note popped through the door saying that this virus might be on the ship — they removed the salt, the pepper,” she said. “We could touch absolutely nothing, if you wanted sugar in your tea or coffee they would come along and do it for you rather than you touching any of these items.“You can’t go out, you can just go out in the hall if someone taps the door. They put the food outside, drop your menus inside and that’s about it.”Not too badBut Ms Bissell said life on board “has not been too bad” so far.“It was a bit mish mash yesterday but today they’ve got things a lot more organised,” she said.“We’re very comfortable and everything you need will be brought to you — eventually — and we are absolutely fine and the ship is fine.”Ms Bissell said those on board have been given very little information on what happens next.Fellow passengers Neil and Victoria Hanlon, from Bridgwater in Somerset, Englan, said they had noticed some people looking ill as long as a week ago.“We have passed a few people on the ship about a week ago who did look seriously ill, they had masks and stuff on,” Mr Hanlon told ITV.“We were in the lift with them which probably wasn’t a good thing. They were going down to where the medical centre was. We asked them if they were okay — their breathing was horrendous.”The Grand Princess is owned by Princess Cruises, and a spokesman for the company said on Friday evening that it was “awaiting official specific plans for future positioning of the ship from relevant authorities”.“Princess Cruises will continue to closely follow the guidance of the CDC (Centres for Disease Control) and other federal and state government authorities.”US President Donald Trump appeared to be in favour of leaving the Grand Princess’s passengers where they are — apparently to avoid increasing the nation’s infection total.‘Wasn’t our fault’Speaking at the CDC campus in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday, Mr Trump said: “I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”Princess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess ship which was quarantined off the coast of Japan for several weeks earlier this year.The ship became a breeding ground for the virus as staff continued to carry out their cooking, serving and cleaning duties while the ship was immobile.Around 700 people caught coronavirus while in quarantine, more than a quarter of the 2,600 people on board.The Japanese authorities later admitted the approach was flawed.

Supermarkets are running low on loo paper. Everywhere, you see the furtive rubbing of hands that indicates the breaking out of sanitising gel (while stocks last). In a somewhat unexpected development, sales of Corona beer have fallen through the floor.Yet still, for the most part, we remain nonchalant. Two American friends visiting recently were astonished to find Londoners going about their business largely as normal. There is even a faint air of contempt here for the drastic measures being taken in some parts of the world. China is welding people into apartment buildings, Italy is shutting its schools and Switzerland is cancelling luxury watch conferences, but we Brits know how to take on a little dose of the flu without so much hoo-ha! This air of confidence is misplaced.There is still a huge amount we don’t know about this new virus. Even the death rate is just an estimate. Taking only confirmed cases – recoveries versus deaths – results in a death rate close to 6 per cent. But scientists are pretty sure that there must be hundreds of thousands of “invisible” cases with symptoms so mild that the carrier hasn’t been tested. That is how they get to their best guess death rate of 1 per cent.The chances are that the real rate could be lower still. The NHS is better prepared than China’s health system was when this started, not least because it is better funded and we have had time to get ready. But the risk for the elderly is still uncomfortably high. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, did not manage to sound entirely reassuring when asked to calm fears amongst old people and he replied: “The great majority of people will survive this.” By which he means around 85 per cent, from the data so far.There is also a question-mark around smokers. One theory is that the higher death rate for men and the deaths among young, seemingly fit health workers in China is due to smoking, but there is no data either way. Brits, fortunately, smoke less than the Chinese.Unfortunately, efforts at containment are hitting an intractable problem. Of the 163 cases identified at the time of writing (of about 20,000 tested) in the UK, at least a dozen simply cannot be traced back to any other known case or foreign travel. In other words, the illness is already spreading undetected. One possibility is that children, who mercifully seem to be less vulnerable to the disease, are nonetheless getting it and displaying no symptoms, thereby acting as silent spreaders. This is one reason why schools for nearly 300 million children worldwide are now closed.These other countries who are shutting schools and cancelling conferences are doing so not because they are a bunch of overreacting wimps, but because it may be one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the disease. Over here, UK policymakers are watching attentively to see whether it works and if we ought to do likewise. Whether this hesitation is sensible and proportionate or a historic mistake is not yet clear.The unspoken truth is that these decisions are ultimately about risk appetite. Scientists can offer advice, but the uncertainties are so great that politicians ultimately have to take decisions about how far to go. The government appears, so far, to be taking the risk that it is not worth implementing measures that cause enormous disruption China, because widespread contagion is ultimately inevitable.There are good reasons for this approach. We know that the epidemic has slowed down in China, but we have no idea if this is due to its drastic quarantine measures, which have plunged its economy into deep freeze. It seems more likely that China’s supreme effort at contact-tracing, which involves finding and testing everyone who has had intimate contact with virus sufferers, was the key factor in dampening down the virus’ spread. The UK has traced the contacts of confirmed patients as much as it can so far.Disruption also has other costs. There have been Chinese cases reported of people in need of urgent medical care for other illnesses but finding themselves trapped in their houses because of the shutdown. And you cannot keep an economy in lockdown forever. When workers return to factories and children go back to school, contagion may well flare up again. Even if we were to shut down schools now, who is to say the virus would not just come back when they reopened?The UK’s approach carries its own risks, however. It may turn out that a short, sharp period of disruption now would stop the virus in its tracks and that we are missing a vital chance. It is hard to imagine that this would not be the undisputed policy choice if those at most risk were young children, rather than the elderly.The virus planning paper released this week estimated that, in a worst-case scenario, 80 per cent of people could ultimately get infected. Such an enormous epidemic is unlikely, but if the virus grows on anything like that scale, the disruption to daily life and the health system will make a few conference cancellations look like a mere prelude. In Hubei province, for example, where the virus first emerged, there are just over 67,000 confirmed cases. That is equivalent to just 0.1 per cent of the population. Even accounting for the many “invisible” cases that have not been identified, the gap between 0.1 and 80 per cent suggests that scientists think there is a long, long way to go before this thing dies down.Boris Johnson is keen to put the country at ease. This week, he claimed to have visited a hospital of coronavirus patients and, “I shook hands with everybody!” But we should be under no illusions.

For a disease that is spread in the community, we need a community response.”The Diamond Princess reported an outbreak of COVID-19 on 3 February As it lay off the Japanese coast.Initially just 10 people were confirmed to be infected with the virus, but by 20 February, 619 passengers had become infected. The decision was then made to evacuate and more than 3,000 passengers left the ship, mostly air-evacuated by their respective countries.By 24 February, two of the passengers had died. The following day, the Japanese health ministry ordered a 14-day quarantine for everyone on the ship and rushed to close its ports to all other cruise ships.Professor Wilder-Smith, who led the study, added: “With the Diamond Princess Cruise ship it’s easy to be wise after the event. Japanese health officials had an unprecedented situation on their hands. In many ways what they did was correct but of course, and Japan has admitted it themselves, their measures weren’t perfect. What’s important now is to learn from this event to ensure future effective control measures for COVID-19 are as strong as possible.”All 3,500 passengers and crew on board the Grand Princess, are to be tested for COVID-19, after initial tests on a limited number found 21 people had coronavirus.US Vice-President Mike Pence said 19 of those who tested positive were crew members. President Donald Trump has said he would prefer the passengers to stay on board, but added that he would listen to experts if their advice was to evacuate the ship and quarantine them at medical facilities on land.The Grand Princess was banned by California state governor Gavin Newson from docking after a 71-year-old California man, who had been on a previous voyage between San Francisco and Mexico, died from COVID-19 following his return home last month.The death of a second person with links to the ship is now being investigated, after a 75-year-old man who died on returning home from the Mexico cruise was found to have tested positive for the virus.Several other passengers who had remained on the vessel for its next voyage to Hawaii also developed flu-like symptoms during that trip.British passengers on board the Grand Princess have told of their ordeal waiting to discover their fate. There was dismay among some that they heard the results of the tests from Vice President Pence on the news rather than direct from the ship’s British captain, John Harry Smith.Jackie Bissell, from Dartford in Kent, said passengers had been given little information on what will happen next.We are waiting for the ship\u0027s captain - but I think he\u0027s as much in the dark as we are and he\u0027s said he\u0027s only giving us information as and when he gets it, she said.Meanwhile a British couple diagnosed with coronavirus on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship remain unable to return to the UK after their latest test came back positive.David and Sally Abel both need three negative test results in order to leave hospital and though both had twice been found negative Mr Abel\u0027s final test came back positive.He said: Sally is now negative but is staying in Japan. Sally is now totally all clear, good to return to the UK. But she won\u0027t because I have had a positive. This is what happens.

But lately, the genre has been wholly taken over by Hollywood psychodramas, usually involving some dysfunctional relationship with a parent or spouse (Ad Astra, Annihilation, Interstellar, even Star Wars) or loss of a child (Gravity, Arrival) and very often encompassing a Heart of Darkness-style evil genius who has decided to destroy the world (Sunshine, Ad Astra). It’s not that space travel isn’t a good vehicle for exploring age-old human problems, if it’s done creatively. But I can’t be alone in pining for the days when a space flick didn’t inevitably involve plumbing the dullest hours of Brad Pitt’s therapy sessions.Back in the day, science fiction was all about gallivanting around the universe, saving it from evil. That approach had its flaws too, not least the often very thin efforts at characterisation. Still, I wonder what it says about Western civilisation that so many of our escapist space fantasies keep leading us back into the troubled, domestic space of our own minds.Friedrich Nietzsche thought that creativity borne of such neurosis was a sure sign of decadence and civilisational decay. So not only do I have to sit through another scene in which a hero floating around in the ether struggles metaphorically and physically to hold onto his space-walking companion before travelling 1,000 kilometres through a ring of space rocks with only a dustbin lid for cover it also means that our way of life is doomed. I eagerly await the release of a Chinese Star Wars.The Science Museum’s “wonder lab” is billed as being for children, but on a recent visit, I saw little that wasn’t also interesting to adults. There were two long cables being spun by small motors on each end, whose speed could be adjusted with dials. As the speed changed, they formed dizzying, fascinating undulations of different widths and shapes.Nearby, you could drop a ball into a “double gravity well” (two big dips next to each other) and watch as it coursed around in a figure of eight before disappearing. In another corner there was a pool of ferrous liquid that formed itself into tight, hedgehog-like balls of cones when attracted by a huge magnet underneath.Next to that, you could experiment with camera shutter speed to capture the exact moment a drop falling into a beaker caused a glimmering coronet of water globules to erupt around it. A show about electric charge ended by releasing an enormous crack of electricity, a silver bolt part-way between an electric shock and a lightning bolt.The discipline of having to design something for children is helpful, because most children will not engage in something entirely abstract. Yet as we grow up we are expected to deal in abstractions more and more.Our willingness to do so is important because successful countries must nurture a strong culture of respect for scientific knowledge, even if we also keep up a healthy attitude of scepticism towards authority. This respect for science is an act of faith for most people, though. We cannot see the virus we are washing away when we follow public health advice, but thankfully, most of us will do it diligently all the same.Still, it is refreshing to visit a place where you can see scientific concepts at work with your own eyes. I might recommend waiting until the epidemic is on the wane, however. The place looked like a petri dish for germs. Fortunately, they remained invisible to the naked eye.The adult equivalent of a child play area is, of course, a gym. Mine recently sent out a note to members asking them to use wipes provided to wipe down equipment and asking us to stay away if we had any symptoms, even mild ones. Helpfully, it did not mention what the main symptoms are. At the bottom of the email, under its logo, was the gym’s usual, tough-guy strapline: “Anything goes”. They had forgotten to add a useful footnote: “Anything goes. Except fever, a dry cough or difficulty breathing.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In mediaeval times, West African civilisation blossomed along the banks of the Niger River into a myriad of kingdoms and empires.During the 13th century, the cities of Gao and Timbuktu rose as great centres of trade and learning. Kings grew fabulously wealthy from the gold and salt trade routes which crisscrossed the Sahara. At a time when Europe was burning heretics at the stake, books become status symbols in the Malian Empire. Islamic scholars collected hundreds of thousands of manuscripts in libraries spread across the region, most famously in Timbuktu. But experts say the region’s extraordinary heritage is under attack. Museums, tombs and villages have been raided for antiquities and photos show historical sites studded with newly dug holes. “You cannot estimate the value of what’s being lost. This is our history. When that goes you have nothing to bind you together.” Solid details on the illicit trade artefacts are scarce. Historically, the Sahel has not received as much attention from archaeologists as North Africa and the Middle East. There are countless sites of historical significance have been left unmapped and unprotected, according to Mr Sidibé. Local villagers often know the whereabouts of historical sites. But as the Sahel’s security situation continues to deteriorate, many are being forced either by poverty, hunger or armed groups to dig them up antiquities. The raided artefacts — which include everything from statues and masks to mediaeval jewellery and dinosaur bones — often end up in auction houses and private collections in Europe, America and China. It is unclear how much money is being made from the trade but previous seizures of trafficked Sahelian antiquities in Europe have been valued at tens of millions of pounds. There are fears that there could be an even bigger market in the Gulf states.“Objects are often passed around different countries by middlemen before they reach the international market which makes it very difficult to build up a clear picture,” says Guiomar Alonso Cano at UNESCO’s Office for West Africa and the Sahel. “As the crisis continues to escalate, we must ensure that the Sahel’s extraordinary cultural heritage is safeguarded and does not go towards funding organised crime and terrorist groups,” continues Mrs Alonso Cano, who is helping to train dozens of customs officials to identify stolen cultural goods. The current scourge is not without precedent.When jihadists from Ansar Dine, a group allied to Al Qaeda, invaded northern Mali in 2012, they unleashed an iconoclastic frenzy on the medieval city of Timbuktu. For Ansar Dine, few places reeked of idolatry more than Timbuktu, with its 333 Sufi saints whose shrines were frequently visited by locals hoping to propitiate the Almighty.The jihadists used pickaxes, hoes, Kalashnikov rifles and sometimes just their bare hands to tear down the city’s mud-brick mausolea: 15 of the 16 most important were destroyed, says El-Boukhari Ben Essayouti, who heads the Malian government’s Timbuktu Cultural Commission. Worse still, over 4,400 ancient manuscripts were burned or stolen during the city’s year-long occupation. Thankfully, the situation for Timbuktu and its treasure trove of knowledge has improved significantly.With donor help, the shrines have been rebuilt and the damage done to mosques has been repaired. And with the help of Minusma, the UN peacekeeping mission, three libraries holding some of Timbuktu’s private manuscript collections have been restored. Far greater damage could have been done had it not been for people like Ben Essayouti, who, when the city fell, bundled 8,000 manuscripts into sackcloth, stacked them in crates and then hid them in a bunker.He and a network of concerned citizens then managed to smuggle over 300,000 manuscripts to safety. Today, most are hidden in vaults around Mali’s southern capital, Bamako. Today, the man who masterminded the smuggling operation, Dr Abdel Kader Haidara, is leading a project to restore and digitalise the manuscripts, with the support of the British Library. He hopes that by digitalising the manuscripts, he can safeguard them for the next generation and eventually make them available online for everyone around the world to read. In small rooms at Dr Haidara’s Bamako-based NGO Savama, researchers painstakingly leaf through the manuscripts, taking camera shots of every page and logging the contents. Some are hundreds of pages long. Even by digitalising an estimated 20,000 manuscripts a year, researchers say it will take at least a decade to complete the task. But with each flick of the page and camera flash, another small part of the Sahel’s history is saved. More from NewsJohn Mills and John LongworthMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy irons university students crazy stifle free speech","story":"University students are “crazy” to ban controversial speakers, Jeremy Irons has said in a warning over free speech on campus.The 71-year-old actor, who is Chancellor of Bath Spa University, said he gets “very depressed” when people are banned from addressing students because some disagree with their views.His remarks follow a week where speakers were no platformed at Oxford, while former Home Secretary Amber Rudd also had an invitation to address an audience withdrawn over her involvement in the Windrush scandal.Speaking to The Sunday  this week, the Oscar winning actor said: “I think it’s right that all views should be examined and certainly acceptable to discuss.“I get very depressed when I see that certain outside speakers are barred from talking in various universities. I think this is crazy.”Ministers are now considering increasing the powers of the university regulator to ensure it has the authority to censor student bodies which fail to protect free speech.The Education Secretary said it was “unacceptable” that two speakers were “no-platformed” at events in Oxford.It prompted an investigation at an Oxford college into the dispute, which saw a female historian barred from a feminist event.Prof Selina Todd, an expert in the history of working-class women, had been invited to speak at the event but the evening before she was told she was barred.The academic has previously been accused of being a transphobe for her involvement in women\u0027s rights advocacy and for her teaching of feminist history.Meanwhile Ms Rudd said the decision of students to cancel her address at an event run by Oxford’s UN Women society was rude.Her invitation was rescinded 30 minutes before it was due to begin after students objected to her involvement in the Windrush scandal.She took to twitter to criticise the badly judged move.Responding on Friday, a spokesman for Oxford University said it strongly disapproves of the decision to disinvite Ms Rudd, adding that she should have been given the opportunity to speak. Irons said:  “We are learning to be more respectful of each other and be more empathetic to each other, I think all universities have certain rules to protect students and that’s right.“But with those rules in place I think one also has to remember that universities are about discussion, disagreement, forming opinions, listening to people with erse opinions and testing your own ideas.”Irons also warned that England is in danger of becoming a nation of philistines as drama, music and dance are getting squeezed out of the school curriculum.Speaking at the opening of Bath Spa’s new art and design campus, he said that the arts are at risk of becoming the preserve of the middle classes since state schools do not have the time or resources to teach them.Irons also tackled the sensitive issue of sexual harassment at universities, suggesting it is being fueled by youngsters spending so much time speaking to each other on social media sites that they are forgetting how to develop real life relationships.“I worry that we are raising a generation of young people who are too used to communicating through screens and not enough to communicating to faces,” he said.“I worry because it means people don’t have the experience for understanding the signals that come from other people.He said he believes that some sexual harassment claims on campus are tied up with issues surrounding communication.Men and women, they look for signals in each other. If we are used to looking at faces and understanding behaviour, face to face, then I think a lot of these misunderstandings could be avoided,” he said.Irons, whose illustrious screen and stage career in acting s over half a century, has previously courted controversy over remarks he has made.In an interview with the Radio Times in 2011 when he said: If a man puts his hand on a woman\u0027s bottom, any woman worth her salt can deal with it. It\u0027s communication. Can\u0027t we be friendly?He also once admitted: I do love women, and I have a habit of affectionately touching them.He has long since backtracked and expressed regret, saying that he wished he had buttoned my lip.More from NewsJohn Mills and John LongworthMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mr loophole lawyer offer free legal advice anyone joins 60 mile","story":"With clients including the likes of David Beckham, Sir Alex Ferguson and Top Gear presenters Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness, the legal services \u0027Mr Loophole\u0027 are beyond the reach of most motorists who find themselves on the wrong side of the law.But now celebrity solicitor Nick Freeman is preparing to offer free legal advice to anyone who joins him on a sponsored walk.The 64-year-old, who earned the nickname Mr Loophole, after using a variety of technicalities to get his clients off, is taking part in a charity event to raise money for Parkinson’s Disease.Mr Freeman came up with the idea after his younger brother, John, was diagnosed with the devastating condition.Later this month he will set off on a 60 mile walk from his home in Cheshire to his brother’s home in Nottingham and will dispense free legal advice to anyone he meets along the way in return for a donation to Parkinson’s UK.Mr Freeman told the Sunday : “I am calling it my 60 60 60 walk. I am doing the walk to mark John’s 60th birthday, it is about 60 miles and I am aiming to raise £60,000.“John and I are very close. He was a big strapping bloke and it has been terrible to see the effect this terrible disease has had. it does not discriminate and can affect anyone yet the research that is going on into finding a cure does not get any government funding at all.“Hopefully I can use my reputation to help raise some money to continue the search for a cure. I will be walking 20 miles each day with my son, Ben and my Staffordshire Bull Terrier, George.“I`m really hoping the walk has a bit of a `Pied Piper` effect and that as I pass through areas, people will join me for a while and anyone who comes to see me along the way can get a free legal consultation in return for a donation.“It doesn’t have to be a motoring offence, I am a criminal solicitor so it could be a whole range of matters, from family disputes to police matters. Hopefully I will be able to give them some helpful advice or point them in the right direction.”Mr Freeman went on: John`s diagnosis came like a bolt out of the blue. Here was a strapping guy, the type who liked to chop down trees or drive around on tractors. suddenly finding it difficult to walk or even hold a fork without trembling.“As you might imagine, our family was devastated not least because the disease is currently  incurable.Yet scientists keep telling us that a cure is so close.“Which makes the lack Government  funding both frustrating and all the more appalling. That\u0027s why I felt compelled to raise money – not only to help John but for the 145,000 people diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s, each year.”The walk will begin in Cheshire before moving through the Peak District and onto north Nottinghamshire.More from NewsJohn Mills and John LongworthMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"navys future fleet should multi purpose like mobile phones says","story":"Future Navy ships should be multi-purposeful like mobile phones so that they can play different roles in disasters and wars, the Chairman of the Defence Select Committee has said. Tobias Ellwood, a former defence minister, said that the next generation of Type 31 frigates, which were announced by Boris Johnson last year as part of his pledge to expand the Royal Navy’s fleet, should be approached in the same way as moving into a “new house with empty rooms”.Mr Ellwood has written to Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, setting out the three main ways the Type 31s can be adapted to future proof them in order to match the widening spectrum of maritime duties expected of it.Under his proposals the hull would come with basic maritime and security features, but is essentially an empty shell”, similar to a “mobile phone before you download the various apps”. Each hull of the Type 31 would be fitted with a series of docking points for a number of shipping containers to plug into, both on and beneath the deck. He told the Sunday : Then you treat it like a new house and decide what to put into all these empty rooms.”By fitting the ship with a number of containers, items can be moved on and off rather than being permanently fitted with equipment for the appropriate deployment, so that the vessel can be suitable to responding to humanitarian disasters as well as going to war. “For example containers could be fitted with electronic warfare units, air defence systems, and munitions storage for missiles and ammunition,” Mr Ellwood said. “However, when you then want to use the ship to respond to a humanitarian disaster you can remove all of these containers and put on new containers that consist of barracks, classrooms, and operating theatres.” Fundamental to this would be to build frigates with a ramp at the rear something that is not common practice. This would enable “easy access to load interior when docked in the port”, much like cross channel ferries.Mr Ellwood, who served in the Royal Green Jackets and reached the rank of captain, also said the deck of a ship, which is currently only ever big enough to house one helicopter, should be expanded in order to fit two. These three elements would pave the way for versatile, multi-mission vessels,” he said. It comes after Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the International Aid Secretary, was said to be looking at proposals to buy a new purpose-built hospital navy ship.However, Mr Ellwood said this risks being left idle when not in use, and said the UK should be “more ambitious”. “Just as mobile phones are tailored to inidual needs using apps- so to should the Type 31 with the end product able to operate in a number of deployments.Earlier this week in a written question to Parliament, Mr Wallace warned of the need to invest in smaller defence and security companies as they struggle to compete in an ever changing technological world.Ahead of the upcoming integrated Strategic Defence and Security Review, he said that whilst many of the UK’s defence and security companies were flourishing,  “suppliers from large companies to SMEs” now faced “challenges for the future”, such as the pace of technological change and increased competition from abroad. “We need to consider how to address these challenges and maximise potential opportunities,” Mr Wallace said.  Mr Ellwood said employing British SMEs to produce shipping containers would be opportune in the current climate. “The Government’s review is heralded as ‘the most radical assessment of Britain’s place in the world since the cold war and this means our defence capabilities must advance to match our new ambitions,” he said. More from NewsJohn Mills and John LongworthMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nobel prize distant memory lesbos right wing vigilante backlash","story":"It is the kind of quiet little Aegean village that Britons might dream of during the long winter nights.But there was nothing quaint or charming about the tiny port of Thermi on the island of Lesbos this week when a German journalist was brutally beaten up by a bunch of hooded Greek thugs.Michael Trammer, 25, was photographing a standoff with a dinghy full of refugees who had just crossed from Turkey, with locals determined to prevent them from landing.All of a sudden, he was set upon by five or six young men in tracksuit bottoms and puffer jackets, who grabbed him, threw him to the ground and started kicking and punching him.“I wanted to get a photo of the people who were stopping people on the boat from getting off,” he told The .“A group formed and they started harassing other journalists, then they split off and sprinted towards me.”Mr Trammer, who was alone, was subjected to a 30-second attack in which his camera was thrown into the sea.He was left needing stitches to his head and left Lesbos the next day, fearful for his personal safety after receiving death threats on social media.The attack was just one of a series of assaults on journalists and aid workers on Lesbos in the last few days. The island\u0027s nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 for its handling of the refugee crisis is now a distant memory.The island has seen a fresh wave of refugee arrivals in boats this week arranged by smugglers on the Turkish coast.The exodus was prompted by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, after he announced last week that his government would no longer stop asylum seekers from trying to reach Greece by sea and by land.The Turkish move, apparently designed to extract more money from Brussels and diplomatic support for Ankara’s military offensive in Syria, has led to violent clashes between refugees and Greek forces on the border with Turkey.On Lesbos, young men have targeted reporters and NGOs because they perceive them as being sympathetic to the refugees’ plight.It is not clear if they are local or outsiders from the mainland, possibly connected to far-Right organisations.On Friday there were reports that members of German and Austrian far-Right groups had arrived on the island.Their presence was deeply disconcerting for aid workers and journalists who already feel they are being subjected to a witch-hunt.Lesbos, where 20,000 refugees and migrants are squeezed into the squalid Moria camp that was built to accommodate less than 3,000, has been on the frontline since the great migration crisis of 2015, but the attacks and the makeshift road blocks set up by extremists represent a worrying new development.In another incident, four young women working for an NGO were stopped in their car by a group of men who forcibly dragged them out.The young women made it out unscathed after another group of locals passing by saw what was happening and intervened, giving the women enough time to get back in their car and drive away.On Monday, two German journalists were attacked on a road leading to Moria camp.Franziska Grillmeier and Julian Busch were left shaken when a group of men in hoodies and dressed in black emerged from the side of the road.They blocked the car and began hurling rocks and sticks at it.“We tried to turn around and then they were jumping on our car and throwing stones and wooden sticks. We had to turn around in the car and drive away very fast,”said Mr Busch. “They tried to open the doors and it was really aggressive and we were afraid.”Giorgos Christides, a correspondent for Der Spiegel, also came under attack when protesters who had built road blocks threw objects at his car.“We were beaten up, threatened, chased, harassed, attacked on social media, berated in the street and pursued by masked men on motorbikes. It went on like this for days,” he wrote, saying he was relieved to leave the island.“I can understand the frustration of the locals. They feel abandoned by Europe. They seem to believe that the problems will disappear if the journalists and aid organisations disappear. They want Moria shut down and for the migrants to be moved elsewhere.”Even doctors treating the sick and injured refugees have been targeted.A member of Medecins Sans Frontieres was told by an angry group of people in Moria village, a couple of miles from the refugee camp, that if he did not pack his belongings and leave within a week, there would be “consequences.”NGOs have expressed anger that their employees have been attacked, as have journalists’ groups.“We note with great concern that certain groups on the island of Lesbos move in an organised manner to intimidate and attack journalists covering the flow of refugees and migrants arriving from Turkey,” the Foreign Press Association of Greece said in a statement.Gulnoza Said, the Europe coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: “Greek authorities must quickly and thoroughly investigate the attacks on reporters covering refugee movements on the island of Lesbos and ensure that they can continue their reporting safely and without fear.”The tension has been building for years even if, in the past, Lesbos has shown itself capable of extraordinary solidarity with migrants and refugees.Islanders were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 for their efforts to help those arriving on their shores during the peak of the refugee crisis.But the rise in tensions on islands like Lesbos was little surprise, said Dimitra Kalogeropoulou, Greece director for the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian organisation.“Local communities have been impacted by the government’s policies towards asylum seekers, especially the containment policy, which has trapped over 40,000 people on the islands.“Overcrowding on the islands is good for no one local communities feel their islands have been transformed into giant prisons, while asylum seekers are forced to live in dangerous conditions.”Not everyone on the island has turned against journalists and aid workers – many locals are appalled by the actions of the extremists.“Just after the attack happened there was an old lady and some men from the island who told me that they would take care of me and protect me,” said Mr Trammer.Dimitrios, an islander who asked not to be named in full because of the tensions on Lesbos, believes most islanders are outraged by the attacks.“Humanitarian relief is still the initial reaction towards the situation by the majority of the population,” he said.Small bands of black-clad extremists do not represent the majority of islanders. “Most are civil and laid-back people, but they feel like they have been betrayed by the European Union and exploited by Turkey. For some, this has hardened their views.”More from NewsJohn Mills and John LongworthMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarkets begin food rationing wave coronavirus fueled panic","story":"Supermarkets have begun rationing food as a result of coronavirus panic buying.Tesco is limiting the amount of baked beans, dry pasta and UHT milk its customers can buy to ensure they have enough supply, as its shelves were emptied across Britain.On Saturday the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain rose to 206, with scientists warning diagnoses are doubling every other day. On its current trajectory, experts fear the UK could breach 1,500 by the end of the week.Supermarkets have been forced to act after their shelves were plundered again on Saturday, with customers reporting shortages of ready meals, toilet roll and paracetamol.Tesco took the decision to limit some food and drink to five items per customer, in addition to antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays. A spokesman confirmed the restrictions, which will also limit the amount of Calpol people can purchase, began on Saturday, and will apply to online shopping orders from Sunday. The Government is also expected to announce plans to alert supermarkets before the general public if they are in coronavirus hotspots, to help avoid empty aisles.Retailers have reassured ministers they have robust plans in place to minimise disruption and are continuing to monitor their supply chains.Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda have also seen their aisles stripped bare of soap and toilet paper, while online hand sanitiser products were selling for more than 5,000 per cent of their recommended retail price online, with bottles worth 49p going for £24.99. Further trends of panic buying include sugar, flour, eggs, rice, vitamins, cold and flu tablets, and cleaning products.The Environment Secretary will meet with retailers on Monday to discuss support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation and any other areas where government can offer support.Another 43 coronavirus cases were confirmed throughout the UK on Saturday raising the total to 206 - a near doubling of the 115 cases confirmed on Thursday.Prof Sheila Bird, formerly programme leader at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, said that the UK\u0027s cumulative total is currently doubling roughly every two days. If that continues the number of confirmed infections in the UK could hit 412 by Monday and continue to skyrocket. By next Friday some 1,600 people could have the virus and by Tuesday March 17 the figure could be as many as 6,592.She called for health officials to provide more information on the pattern of the outbreak as a way of providing clues as to which groups in the population were most affected.Saturday\u0027s rise came after the chief scientific adviser confirmed the infection was now spreading person to person as part of an outbreak in Britain, having been initially limited to infections brought in from abroad.Sir Patrick Vallance said on Friday: “This is the start of an outbreak clearly. We are in the position now where we have got person-to-person transmission of this in the UK and therefore we can expect more cases.”  Already two people have died from the virus in Britain, a grandfather in his 80s in Milton Keynes and a woman in her 70s in Reading.Last night, the family of the grandfather described the nightmare of having to self-isolate themselves, unable to grieve as they would wish or to arrange a funeral.They said he died at Milton Keynes Hospital shortly after being advised on Thursday evening that he had tested positive but said the cause of death had not been confirmed.Five of the new cases were in the East of England, while Cornwall had its second confirmed case - a resident linked to the first case who had also travelled to Northern Italy.A school in Chatham, Kent, has shut after two pupils contracted coronavirus. St John Fisher School told parents buildings would be deep cleaned this week following confirmation of the two cases.The crisis also forced the cancellation of a marmalade festival in Dalemain, Cumbria, which was expected to attract thousands of international visitors. Jane Hasell-McCosh, the festival’s founder, said it had been an extraordinarily difficult decision to make.  More from NewsJohn Mills and John LongworthMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/05/19/container.jpg","title":"coronavirus business impact britain no deal brexit","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.While large multinationals may be able to ride out the economic turmoil on the horizon, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspBen Chapman reportsBritish manufacturers say they are summoning up the “wartime spirit” to deal with anticipated staff shortages and supply disruption caused by the coronavirus.But for some, the major concern is a short, deep shock from the outbreak followed by the longer, more drawn-out pain of a hard Brexit.While large multinationals may be able to ride out those twin problems, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government warned this week that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick at the height of the Covid-19 epidemic, a scenario that would present serious problems for manufacturers.“We may have a few people off or we may be decimated,” says Donald Pow, a manager at Allied Vehicles Group in Glasgow.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitAround 250 of Allied’s 670 staff work in manufacturing, mostly in Glasgow.

That might include relaxing banks’ capital requirements to allow them to hand out more loans – but there’s no guarantee that the banks will actually do it.Live: EU reveals ‘very difficult differences’ with UK over BrexitBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitCoronavirus and no-deal Brexit: Spot the differenceBoost from US trade deal could be as small as 0.02 per cent of GDPFor some British firms, the impact is already being felt.Tudor Rose International, a Gloucestershire-based logistics company, exports well-known food and drinks brands around the world.\u0026nbspIt is close to the sharp end of the outbreak. Costs have shot up around 15 per cent so far as the company struggles to find enough ships to transport its products, says commercial manager\u0026nbspJohn Stephenson.\u0026nbspTudor Rose is losing sales as ships stay stuck in Chinese ports, causing a major backlog in the key arteries of world trade.\u0026nbspWith many Chinese factories shut down to contain the virus’s spread, there is much less to ship and so freight companies have cancelled sailings. That leaves British firms facing a shortage of containers to put their goods into, pushing up prices.“It has an effect all along those routes via places like Mumbai and the Middle East,” says\u0026nbspStephenson.Shipping is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for economic shocks to come. With a vessel taking about a month to make its way from China to Europe, the sharp drop in activity in China is still working its way through.Stephenson estimates that there are about 100 fewer vessels on the global routes along which Tudor Rose ships its food and drink. That may not sound like a lot but each one is vast, carrying an average 20,000 containers.Two million fewer containers has a real impact, says Stephenson. “It’s already been quite pronounced. We’ve had a customer already waiting for a large order that we haven’t been able to fill.”Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe effect coronavirus is having on shipping is unprecedented, he says. “We do see some seasonality of demand but we’ve not seen an event like this that’s had this much impact.”Tudor Rose has been looking to boost sales in North America where disruption has been less severe than Asia but there is a limit to this strategy.“We sell fast-moving consumer goods so we need a consistent, regular supply to our customers,” says Stephenson. The company anticipates some rebound in demand when the outbreak calms down but for the most part, sales lost now are likely to be lost for good.If Chinese ports open up fully again things will improve, but Tudor Rose fears there may be further shutdowns at other key points along the route as governments seek to contain the virus.“We are at the early stages of this. It’s only in the last 10\u0026nbspdays that it’s come to light how significant this could be,”\u0026nbspsays StephensonBack in Glasgow, Donald Pow is remaining vigilant but relatively relaxed, given the situation. “We don’t know what’s going to happen many of the experts don’t seem to know what’s going to happen.”“It’s like that old football manager cliche: we just take each game as it comes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or are companies in for disappointment?Hundreds of flights have been cancelled, major sporting events called off.Business has dried up entirely for some unfortunate firms.The economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak has already been significant.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it’s likely to get worse.There’s speculation the Tokyo Olympics this summer might need to be postponed – a festival on which the Japanese government has already spent some $25bn (£19bn).But that’s why businesses and iniduals take out insurance isn’t it? To cover themselves for when unexpected and hugely damaging shocks like disease outbreaks hit?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe UK government this week, under pressure from industry lobby groups, designated\u0026nbspCovid-19 a “notifiable disease”, in order to make it easier for affected companies to claim insurance.So can we expect an avalanche of claims and big losses for insurance companies as a result of this outbreak?Or are companies in for disappointment if they expect to be compensated for the economic damage wreaked by Covid-19?It’s worth drawing a distinction between two broad categories of business insurance, say experts.First, there’s event cancellation insurance, which is a type generally offered by sophisticated insurance markets like Lloyd’s of London or major insurance conglomerates.Torsten Jeworrek of the German insurer Munich Re\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspReuters\u0026nbsplast month that his firm had provided cancellation insurance for the Tokyo games “in the hundreds of millions of euros”.Second, there’s the more general cover for “business interruption” offered to companies by smaller insurance firms.But if a firm is covered it’s covered, isn’t it?Not necessarily. It all depends on the wording of the inidual insurance contract.But it’s important to bear a broad principle in mind, namely that there’s a difference from the perspective of the insurance company between “definable” and “undefinable” risk.And insurance firms are unlikely to have written an insurance policy that covers a firm from the impact of an undefinable risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Think of a hotel that sees its bookings slump because people change their travel plans. Or a company that suffers because it’s staff don’t turn up to work because of illness.Would cutting rates really help the economy deal with coronavirus?In any case, industry experts caution that “notifiable disease” clauses (the classification the UK government updated this week) are not standard in insurance contracts.“Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks, not those that are very unlikely, such as the effects of Covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers.So what’s the bottom line: are insurers going to be hit hard or not?Crawford Forensic Accounting Services produced a report last month on the likely impact of coronavirus on the insurance sector.It concluded that “successful claims under business interruption coverage for infection are not common”.Crawford director Frederique Hardy also told The Independent that event cancellation insurance contracts tend to be very bespoke, making it difficult to generalise about the ability of event organisers to make claim.Yet the general view of the industry – at the moment – is that coronavirus is unlikely to result in an explosion of costly payouts.If that’s correct it points to a lot of disappointed firms.And, as a by product, it’s likely to increase further the pressure on governments to give stressed companies economic relief in the form of more time to pay tax and perhaps forbearance on debt repayments to banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates, with investors expecting other major central banks to soon follow suit.Officials and companies in Britain, France, Italy and the United States are struggling to deal with a steady rise in virus infections that have in some cases triggered corporate defaults, office evacuations, and panic buying of daily necessities.The outbreak spread across the United States on Thursday, surfacing in at least four new states.“The interplay of virus containment fears and stimulus measures means that in the near term we expect market volatility to persist,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Yields on US Treasuries fell to a record low and Treasury futures jumped as investors increased bets that the Fed will follow this week’s surprise rate cut with further easing.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record low of 0.7650 per cent on Friday.Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari said late on Thursday the Fed could cut rates further if needed.Money markets are pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In life, her dentition appears to have been pristine – with virtually no pre-death wear and tear.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But as coastal erosion undercut the cliffs, the abbesses who succeeded her\u0026nbspincreasingly realised that the building would eventually end up crashing into the sea below.Some time in the eighth century\u0026nbspher remains were removed from the stricken chapel and put into a specially built shrine in the nunnery’s main church.\u0026nbspBy the late 11 century, the nunnery had become a monastery.However, following the Norman conquest, a\u0026nbspcastle was built around it – so, in the 12\u0026nbspcentury, the monks demanded that they be allowed to move to a new, less secular, site.The princess’s bones were therefore disinterred again\u0026nbspand moved, in 1138, a few hundred metres away to a brand new church, a later version of which still stands today as Folkestone’s Parish Church. There she became the centre of a local cult and was believed to be able to help cure disease. Her official saint’s day\u0026nbspis 12 September.But, after the mediaeval period had drawn to a close, Eanswythe’s story took a new and unexpected turn.When Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, the government became increasingly hostile to the veneration of saints. In 1535, the prior of Folkestone seems to have realised that, unless he took drastic action, government officials would seize and destroy Eanswythe’s bones. So he (or some of his monks) appear to have hurriedly forced the lead box containing them\u0026nbspinto a secret hole in the church wall and blocked it off.The prior, or a senior church member, then showed the officials a probably gold or gem-studded reliquary, almost certainly containing just a few parts of the saint’s skull.Discoveries offer detailed glimpse of life in prehistoric BritainThat box, with its diminished contents, was subsequently seized by the government and was then acquired by a member of Henry VIII’s household, a Folkestone politician and businessman called Anthony Aucher, who no doubt profited substantially by selling any gems which had adorned the reliquary.Meanwhile, Eanswythe rested safe and secure in her dark hiding place inside the church’s north wall, just beside the altar.Gradually her hiding place was forgotten – until, in 1885, workmen engaged in modernising the church\u0026nbspstumbled across her remains. There was immediate speculation about the possibility that they could be the bones of St Eanswythe and the discovery was reported in newspapers worldwide.But in the 19th century, there was no way of confirming her identity.So for 132 years, the bones were stashed away in a specially constructed wall niche and once again began to fade from memory, until just three years ago a group of local historians and archaeologists decided to try to solve the mystery.They did so by asking scientists to examine the bones in order to discover the long-dead inidual’s age at death and sex – and by carrying out radiocarbon dating tests to ascertain whether the bones did indeed date from the seventh century.The answers virtually proved that the fragmentary skeleton was indeed that of St Eanswythe.The scientists were able to demonstrate that the inidual was almost certainly female.Medieval sources had said that she had died very young – and the scientific examination of her bones and teeth revealed that the inidual had been between 17 and 21 years old when she had passed away.The radiocarbon tests then revealed that she had died in the mid-seventh century – the exact period when Eanswythe‘s life ended.What’s more, examination of her teeth showed virtually no pre-death scratches on her tooth enamel, a fact that suggests that she had consumed relatively little coarse food.Throughout the medieval period, a large number of stories attached themselves to her. She was credited with at least five miracles\u0026nbspand was venerated by people in the Folkestone area.She was believed, for instance, to have miraculously made water run uphill (a story probably developed in order to explain an optical illusion which seemed to show a local aqueduct channelling water up a gradient). She was also credited for resurrecting a dead goose that had been stolen and eaten.Eanswythe was also said to have miraculously lengthened a wooden beam to construct a church by calling on Christ to help when a pagan king and his gods had failed to lengthen it.And after her death, her ghost was said to have cured a man suffering from leprosy or some other skin disease.Remains of ‘man who named Australia’ found during HS2 excavationWho was Suzy Lamplugh? New excavations aim to solve 1986 murderExcavations of medieval chapel at site linked to King ArthurBut, beyond those legends, what was her real significance?In a sense, she symbolises the huge contribution to early English history made by high-status women.\u0026nbspPrior to the coming of Christianity, it is not known whether Anglo-Saxon women played any major political roles.But the coming of Christianity certainly provided one. Princesses played a major part in the conversion of England from paganism to the new faith. When Anglo-Saxon and other Christian princesses married pagan Anglo-Saxon kings, their presence often allowed Christianity to gain the upper hand and flourish.What’s more, those royal daughters who did not marry kings and princes were established by their royal fathers or brothers as abbesses of a new type of institution – nunneries, which in turn, alongside the monasteries, began to wield substantial social and cultural influence. Many of the new abbesses (like Eanswythe) became popular saints and were revered for centuries.St Eanswythe died some 1,360 years ago\u0026nbspbut her newly rediscovered life and times are about to captivate a new audience.“Our identification of St Eanswythe’s skeletal remains open up the possibility of using DNA to investigate the ancestry of the Kentish and Frankish royal dynasties,” said the senior archaeologist involved in the project, Dr Andrew Richardson of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust.“St Eanswythe was a local heroine of great relevance to local people. In mediaeval times, they saw her as their protector from disease and suffering. Researching her today will bring the people of Folkestone nearer to that history,” said the head of the Finding Eanswythe project, Dr Lesley Hardy, a historian at Canterbury Christ Church University.The project is being largely financed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 650 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Season five has just arrived and journeys even deeper into the Breaking Bad expanded universe. Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – it turns its attention in its fourth and fifth season to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars, with Diego Luna playing Guadalajara cartel honcho Miguel Gallardo. 1350 Master of NoneA cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, its second run sees Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replace Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. He’s a perfect fit for the part too, delving into the inner turmoil of a character who accumulates a multitude of ghosts across his endless life.2150 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Bateman recently won a best director Emmy for his work on the series, seizing the gong from beneath the noses of Game of Thrones’s David Benioff and DB Weiss. Season three is due in March 2020.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3350 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3850 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4050 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.Henry Cavill stars as titular monster hunter Geralt of Rivia in a pulpy adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski’s best-selling fantasy novels (the show is not directly based on the hit video game series). It’s a ludicrous lark with a plot that often baffles (watch out for those multiple timelines). But Cavill is fantastic as the Witcher and he has a great support cast including Anya Chalotra as sorceress Yennefer , Freya Allan as Princess Ciri and Joey Batey as Jaskier the Bard. It is estimated to be the most in-demand TV show in the world across all platforms. All together now, “toss a coin to your Witcher, oh ratings of plenty…”An old-school, over-the-top thriller, adapted from the Harlan Coben bestseller. The setting is a fictional town of Cedarfield, which seems to be somewhere within commuting distance of Manchester. Richard Armitage plays a loving dad and husband whose world falls apart when a mysterious woman tells him his wife (Dervla Kirwan) faked her pregnancy. Jennifer Saunders later pops up as a mother whose family has its own secrets. 4350 Chilling Adventures of SabrinaBaroque with bells on and camper than a disco ball at a tent convention, Netflix’s rebooting of Sabrina the Teenage Witch makes a virtue of excess. Kiernan Shipka –  Don Draper’s daughter from Mad Men –  lights up the screen as the half-human half witch teenager drawn into a tangle with the devil himself. Miranda Otto and The Office’s Lucy Davies play her eccentric aunts. And there’s a cat named Salem, though he doesn’t talk.4450 Next in FashionFeel-good reality TV was once a contradiction in terms. But the vibes are agreeably optimistic in this fashionista contest in which professional designers compete for a $250,000 price. Presenters Tan France and Alexa Chung bring the common touch and the contestants appear to be enjoying themselves rather than undergoing the ordeal of a lifetime. Essentially, it’s Bake Off on the catwalk.4550 Locke and KeyJoe Hill’s bestselling graphic novels receive the YA treatment in this urban fantasy about a house full of portals to other worlds and the grieving family who make their home there. The break-out performance is by Emilia Jones – daughter of singer Aled – playing middle child Kinsey Locke. Hill, the son of Stephen King, moved heaven and earth to bring his story to the screen and the effort has paid off.Trekkies have agreed to disagree regarding this often madcap reboot of the venerable sci-fi saga. Suffice to say, if starships powered by “spore drives” or Harry Potter’s Jason Isaacs over-acting across multiple dimensions is off-putting then this isn’t the Trek for you. But others have warmed to the ambitious storytelling, top-notch FX and Sonequa Martin-Green’s earnest performance as science officer Michael Burnham.The Spanish thriller has become one of Netflix’s most popular non-English language shows. There’s certainly lots going on. The story begins with a daring raid on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, overseen by the mysterious Professor (Álvaro Morte) Thereafter it gets steadily more bonkers and the location shifts from Spain to Germany and Thailand. Though all the twists and turns, highs and lows, Money Heist is never less than gripping. 4850 Night on EarthDavid Attenborough\u0027s Our Planet has hoovered up all the attention. But this UK-made series, narrated by Orange is the New Black’s Samira Wiley, brings a new perspective to wildlife TV. Shot using heat-sensitive cameras, Night on Earth features lions romping by moonlight and cacti blooming under the desert stars. It’s like journeying to another world, with reality only returning as the sun rises. Kaya Scodelario – recently seen in the new BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie’s The White Horse – owns the screen as a promising young skater recovering from a serious injury. Her real challenge is off the rink as she tries to conceal her family’s history of mental illness. It’s clearly pitched at a YA audience and is a bit overwrought in places. But Spinning Out is never less than watchable and it’s a shame it was cancelled after just one series. 5050 Living with YourselfPaul Rudd and Aisling Bea have good chemistry in this mordant comedy about a white collar schlub (Rudd) who, in the depths of a midlife crisis, accidentally clones himself. He is forced to compete with his happier, more confident, wittier alter-ego while his wife (Bea) tries to make sense of the transformation. You’ll chuckle rather than fall over clutching your sides but the leads are likeable and the script hums along.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 650 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Season five has just arrived and journeys even deeper into the Breaking Bad expanded universe. Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – it turns its attention in its fourth and fifth season to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars, with Diego Luna playing Guadalajara cartel honcho Miguel Gallardo. 1350 Master of NoneA cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, its second run sees Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replace Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. He’s a perfect fit for the part too, delving into the inner turmoil of a character who accumulates a multitude of ghosts across his endless life.2150 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Bateman recently won a best director Emmy for his work on the series, seizing the gong from beneath the noses of Game of Thrones’s David Benioff and DB Weiss. Season three is due in March 2020.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3350 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing.

It makes it almost certain that more Windrush type scandals will eventually emerge.”David Lammy, a Labour MP and Windrush campaigner, said: “The Home Office has shown repeatedly, before, during and after the Windrush scandal, that it makes frequent mistakes that ruin people’s lives.Home Office urged to reconsider awarding detention contract to SercoMI5 denies Priti Patel shut out of intelligence briefingsGovernment refuses to release findings of grooming gangs reviewHome Office deports asylum seekers despite ‘lack of access to justice’“It is an outrage that 20,000 people have been denied access to information the government holds about them under this exemption. The Home Office is complicit in further injustices that we simply do not know about.”And Ms Bradley added: “Everything about the exemption and how it’s used is shrouded in secrecy – people don’t know things such as whether it’s being used to access their health or education records.”It is unclear how many requests were refused outright, how many saw data partially redacted, or whether some files were eventually released after requests for additional information about the applicant.The use of subject access requests has mushroomed as awareness has grown and as the hostile environment laws have required strict proof of immigration status to live and work.The Law Society, which represents solicitors, and the Bar Council, which represents barristers, had also warned people would be unable to obtain files about themselves.And 34 organisations, including Amnesty, the Refugee Council, the National Aids Trust, the National Education Union and the trade union Unison, signed a protest letter.A Home office spokesperson said: “The government takes both the protection of personal data and the right to privacy extremely seriously.\u0026nbsp“The immigration exemption can only be applied where it is necessary and proportionate to do so, and where to uphold a data subject request would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of effective immigration control. \u0026nbsp“The immigration exemption is not a blanket measure, and its use is justified and on a case-by-case basis. In nearly all cases the immigration exemption applies to a limited amount of data.”Freedom of Information\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

country still deeply split over the decision to leave the European Union, a new poll has suggested.Some 46 per cent of those polled by BMG for The Independent said they would like to rejoin the EU, against 54 per cent who believe the UK should stay out.And there was a deep generational ide, with 63 per cent of 18-24 year-olds, 60 per cent of 25-34 year-olds and 51 per cent of 35-44 year-olds wanting a return to Europe, while 69 per cent of over-65s want to stay out.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the poll suggests some Remainers have become reconciled to Brexit, there was little sign that the UK’s departure from the EU on 31 January had persuaded the majority to accept leaving.The 46-54 split in favour of staying out indicated a small swing in favour of Brexit since January, when a poll taken a fortnight before departure day found 52 per cent wanting to Remain and 48 to Leave.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with

That is why Liberal Democrats will never stop fighting for Britain to have the closest possible relationship with our European friends.And Naomi Smith, the chief executive of Best for Britain, which campaigned for a second Brexit referendum, said: “There are many and varied reasons Brits are worried about the terms on which we leave the world’s largest single market.“Concerns around job security are there and for some people, particularly young people who have only ever been European Brits, there’s a real sense of loss about what’s just happened.“The Government doesn’t need to pit old against young.\u0026nbsp“If it relaxes its wish for a quick orce it can begin working out how we can retain as many of the benefits of EU membership as possible, giving young people greater security while still getting Brexit done.”The chief executive of the European Movement, Hugo Mann, said: “This poll clearly demonstrates that Boris Johnson does not have a mandate for his destructive Brexit plans. The prime minister is trying to use the election to force through a damaging hard Brexit that will harm our economy and our NHS and limit opportunities for the next generation”.Best for Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As long as you wash your hands, shaking hands is OK.The end of handshaking is not something the scientists are recommending.Thousands of deaths could be on the cards, it is feared.A senior government source said: “If we do end up in the scenario where this is a full epidemic, steps will have to be taken that mean le can’t carry on quite as it does now.“And we will have to make some changes to ensure that we are doing everything we can to protect the public and delay the full onset of this virus.”Yesterday the PM said it was highly likely the virus would sp widely in the coming days and weeks.He added: We have agreed a plan... but we can all continue to do our bit to fight this virus — by washing our hands with soap and water for theof time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.A pupil at Churston Ferrers Grammar School in Torbay, Devon, became Britain’s first confirmed child case. It is believed they and a relative were infected on a visit to northern Italy.However medics were baffled by another new case — a patient from Harlow, Essex, who had no contact with anyone from any hotspots.It sparked fears the virus is spreading rampantly throughout the UK.Symptoms of Covid- can include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene.If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.If you have ed from Wuhan in the last  days:If you are in Northern Ireland, call your GP.Please follow this advice evenyou do not have symptoms of the virus.Meanwhile, leading symptom-checking provider to the NHS Doctorlink has been updated to help identy patients risk of having coronavirus.Source: NHSProf Paul Cosford, from Public Health England, said most patients had links to countries where there was widespread infection.But he added: “There is a small number now where it is much more dficult to find that link, and that’s leading us to think we may well see more widespread infection in the UK fairly soon.”An NHS employee working at Kent’s Maidstone Studios, where Catchphrase, Blind Date and Take Me Out are filmed, was also diagnosed.He was in an office rented by the North East London NHS Foundation Trust, where staff have now been told to work from home.A school close to Prince Charles’ Highgrove Estate in Tetbury, Gloucs, fears an outbreak after eight staff had to self-isolate.British Airways has said it will cancel hundreds of flights - including long haul trips to the US - because of falling demand.And it comes as British supermarkets are drawing up plans to feed the nation to help with panic buying associated with the virus too.As part of the plans, supermarkets would work with suppliers to cut back on iety - focusing instead on their supplies of staple products.Many Brits have started to panic buy household items to help them survive, should coronavirus close down their communities. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other. We all want to be healthy and so much of that starts from being clean.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world. Very grateful, thank you. My le is enriched.It seems that Stace is getting tired of “trolls” telling her she’s not bringing up her kids right. Not dressing them in appropriate clothing and stuff.Can’t say I give a monkey’s one way or the other. But I’m not absolutely certain that the best way to convince people you’re an elegant and well-mannered young lady is to take a selfie while you’re laying a cable, you know And then there’s this. She’s annoyed with the trolls right now. But what about when they’ve all gone and started to annoy someone  Who will be left to look at those selfies  Apart from Stacey THERE’S outrage in Darlington over the plight of a bunch of hamsters found in a hedge.

They have now been liberated. So what are they going to feed the snakes Kale and mung bean risotto  I’m telling you, they won’t like that. The likely answer is mice.So why is that any better than feeding them their cousins, hamsters A spokesmouse for the British Association of Small Rodentstold me yesterday: “It’s ludicrous. Totally inconsistent.Hamsters get away with murder. Because they’ve got chubby little cheeks and are refugees from Syria.“But nobody cares about us mice. And at least we don’t spend half the bloody night running around on a wheel like a moron. Can’t stand hamsters, me.”Anyway, Bob’s half the size of Mount Everest and rushing towards us at nearly ,mph. The experts reckon it will just miss us. But they can’t be exactly sure. Bob could swing by to say hello. In which case you can wear as many face masks as you like but it won’t help you one bit.You can even follow the BBC’s excellent advice on “how to wash your hands”. .Bob won’t care. You’ll be locked away in your self-isolating chamber under the stairs. Hands smothered in Dettol. Poncey face mask bought off Amazon. Stacks of dried food to keep you through the entire spring.And then – bang!

But the Queen is nothingnot practical.She has learned the lessons of the unedying exits of Princess Diana and the Duchess of York from The Firm and won’t make the same mistake this time.That’s why she quite beautully told Harry:  “You are much loved and will always be welcomed back” — a line that brings tears to the eyes of a  soppy old monarchist like me.The Queen has not accepted that Megxit is permanent and probably never will. Harry needs some time away to explore and live a le where he isn’t playing second fiddle to his father and brother.Duty and the love of his country might just pull him back soon, she hopes.But perhaps the Queen hasn’t factored in the persuasiveness and passion of Meghan — a truly modern woman with very dferent plans for her husband and their “brand”.SOMETHING Kinda Woohoo as Girls Aloud fans like me got fresh hope this week.One of the main obstacles preventing the chart-topping band reuniting has been the feud between the lovely Nadine Coyle and some of the other members.But Kimberley Walsh met Nadine this week and they seemed to be getting along just fine. Of course, the real battle will be getting Cheryl Tweedy on board.Although with her last single peaking at No, I think she might be willing to kiss and make up with Nads too. As the Pussycat Dolls have proven, there’s nothing like an enormous cheque to help smooth over bitter relations.After all, a high-profile pregnancy and cute baby being born at No always lts our collective spirits, right Similar sentiments were expressed when Tony Blair and David Cameron said  their wives were expecting while PM.  The pregnancies of Kate and Meghan were widely celebrated, too.But we are  gripped by a nasty culture war driven by social media.So after the happy announcement, Twitter once again became a hateful cesspit where apparently respectable professionals found despicable ways to slag off a young woman expecting her first baby, to a man she loves, and spout pathetic conspiracy theories.Ironically, many  were  the same crew who have been banging on for  weeks about the need to be kind to those in the public eye.But those rules instituted by the London liberal keyboard warriors only applyyou have the same political views as they do.If you are a Tory or a Brexiteer, or on the right or work for a popular newspaper, you are such an abhorrent human being in the eyes of the likes of Alastair Campbell and Jameela Jamil that you can be torn to shreds without a hint of irony from the perpetrators who are no better than abusive trolls.THE idea that over-weight people need reminding that they’re the  F-wordis nonsensical.If you have been obese and still battle the bulge every day, you’ll know that being the F-word is inside your head every minute.That’s why I embrace the idea put forward in the Pledge To Eradicate Weight Stigma, by Professor Francesco Rubino, from King’s College London, that describing people as fat, overweight and obese is just as debilitating as a racial slur in .Skinny folk convincing themselves that overweight people are McDonald’s-obsessed lazy slobs is offensive and wrong.And that type of outdated approach will do nothing to solve our obesity epidemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The level of uncertainty means it is unwise for it to attempt to settle the big questions on tax, spending and borrowing.One influential Tory source tells me that: “You can’t do spectacular, interesting stuff during corona. But you can do boring and dficult things.”The Budget will concentrate on delivering the Tories’ election promises. Inside the Treasury it has been dubbed the “Manesto Budget”.It will contain changes to ensure that more infrastructure projects are built outside London and the South East, there will be a “Union connectivity” project launched to better link up England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — expect Boris’s bridge to get a mention — it will green-light a slew of road projects, provide money for fast broadband and increase funding for research.It will also curb the entrepreneurs’ tax relief that has turned from being an encouragement to take a risk on a new business to a general form of tax relief for wealthy investors.The Budget will also seek to emphasise that, despite the undoubted, short-term disruption the coronavirus will cause, the medium-term future for the economy is pretty rosy.Unlike with the  financial crash, the economy will rebound strongly once the virus has passed.There is, though, a big debate going on in government about how much the Government should do to help iniduals and businesses through the corona downturn.The rise in the number of people in the UK who are their own boss means there are more than four million workers not entitled to sick pay.The Government will, almost certainly, offer these people more time to pay their taxes. But what more it should do is the subject of growing debate in Whitehall.One of those involved in these discussions points out: “We can’t pay for the whole gig economy for the next six months.”A minister argues that people can get an advance from universal credit within two days in urgent cases. They fear thatthe Government starts paying the wages of the self-employed, then it will be hard to see where it should stop.They point out that a plumber who earns £, a week now, will almost certainly lose money as the virus spreads. Should the State make that up Coronavirus will change the way we live over the next few months, at the very least.But the challenge for the Government is to ensure that work on everything  doesn’t cease while the country tries to fight this crisis.It still has a job of work to do to get the country ready for le outside the EU and to prepare the economy for the great changes that technology is about to bring.BORIS JOHNSON is determined to defend Priti Patel, his Home Secretary, who is facing ious allegations of bullying from civil servants.Internally, he has given short shrt to those who have suggested he distance himself from her.There is a view in Downing Street that several of the most dramatic charges against her don’t stack up.They also claim that these concerns about Patel’s behaviour were not expressed as official complaints at the time.They, “didn’t reach up at a formal level”, I’m told.No knows, though, that it has a fight on its hands to save Patel.One source tells me: “Yes, she can survive. But there’s no smoke without fire. It is shaping up to be quite a big struggle.”Part of the issue is that there is a view among senior civil servants that, given that the top civil servant at the Home Office has quit because of this row, Patel should go too.But Downing Street know thatPatel goes, it would become harder to push reform through the system.One of those at the heart of government tells me: “You can’t have a situation where civil servants get to determine who their Secretary of State is.”The next hurdle for Patel to clear is Sir Alex Allan’s inquiry into whether her behaviour breached the ministerial code.There is a quiet confidence among her allies that while she will receive some criticism from his report, she won’t be found guilty of breaching the code.Buther former Permanent Secretary Sir Philip Rutnam really is determined to take his case to an employment tribunal, then the situation will become far more dficult for the Home Secretary.THERE’S a new political ide: Do you still shake hands or have you started bumping elbows to try to reduce your risk of contacting coronavirus Boris Johnson is still very much a hand-shaker, as is the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.But some other Cabinet ministers have taken to either nodding politely or bumping elbows.As one of those close to the talks put it: “We’ve told them what we think. Their illusions are disappearing rapidly.”The question now is whether when the EU negotiators turn up in London in less than two weeks’ time, they come with a dferent approach or carry on pushing these ideas.THE local elections in May might have to be postponed because of coronavirus.If the UK’s response to the outbreak is still in the delay phase, continuing with the contests would go against that advice, as it would bring large numbers of people into contact with each other.I understand this option is being discussed in Whitehall, but no decision has been taken.But as one figure in government points out: “We postponed a General Election once because of an epidemic.”The  General Election was pushed back to June from May because of foot-and-mouth disease.Delaying the elections – which will see mayors elected in London, the West Midlands and Manchester among other races – would be a big step, and one the Government would only take with the utmost reluctance.The next few weeks will tell us whether it is necessary or not.- James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I expect it to be less than that.It takes about  weeks to reach the peak then maybe about  weeks to go away again.You expect about  per cent of cases in the nine weeks in the middle of that and  per cent of cases in the three weeks of the middle of that.Up until now most cases were in clusters around people who had travelled back to the UK from aboard.But now - with the rate of cases rocketing - the outbreak from person to person in communities has taken hold.Two British Airways baggage handlers working at Heathrow Airport are among the new positive tests, sparking fears over how many items of luggage they handled while carrying the virus.A ward at Watford General Hospital was evacuated after a patient was confirmed to be infected with COVID-.Meanwhile, a child at Alder Hey Childrens Hospital in Liverpool has tested positive for coronavirus.The patient is one of at least three children in the UK to have become infected with the deadly bug.Last week, a pupil at Churston Ferrers Grammar School in Torbay, Devon, was diagnosed after ing from holiday in northern Italy.A pupil at Kingston Academy school in Surrey also tested positive after ing to the UK from a foreign trip.Elderly patients are the most vulnerable to the virus, with mortality rates of around nine per cent - one in every  people - recorded so far in people aged over .In children and adults aged under  the mortality rate plummets to fewer than one in every  cases.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only the old, frail and sick, they believe, will die. So there is no need to worry.Let’s park, for now, the fact the virus has already mutated into something more aggressive, which might put more people at risk.We need to listen to the experts not for our own sakes but precisely for those old, frail and sick people in and around our lives.That may mean putting other ­people’s needs before our own. Sadly, that does not come ­naturally to everyone. This is the same mindset that sets some people off bulk-buying food andloo roll.Bulk-buying is the epitome of selfishness — quite the opposite of the spirit that united us during World War Two, when people knew they really were in it together.Stockpiling food takes it away from someone who might need it more. I have faith in the public. And I urge everyone to look at what is happening as an invitation — a challenge to rise to — to work out ways in which we can look after each other a little bit ­better.If you know someone old, frail or sick, find ways to make sure they are OK, rather than thinking: “I’m all right, Jack.”As the coronavirus outbreak ­worsens, Britain’s older generation are expected to be warned to self-isolate and stay at home. So it’s up to all of us to do our bit and visit them now — before social distancing is introduced.Coping with loneliness and isolation is already hard enough for many, so let’s do all we can to show them we care. Meanwhile, follow the advice from Public Health England and protect yourself from getting sick as a way of protecting others.Focus on being a good member of your community, on helping others and being a good neighbour. In that way, perhaps, something positive might yet emerge from a very worrying situation.A recent study found our sense of community spirit is declining, with more than half of those polled admitting they barely say a word to their neighbours and do not feel part of a “good neighbourly community”. Just one in ten volunteers with local groups or charities.What happened to us  How did we become so selfish  This “me, me, me” approach is too prevalent. The cult of the inidual approach has led us to think: “As long as my own nest is feathered, I needn’t care about anyone .”If we want something good to come from all this, let’s pause for thought, change our outlook and start thinking of others before we think of ourselves.A crisis can bring out the best — or the worst — in us. We should work to prioritise kindness and bring out the best in each other. The opposite ups the chances of a crisis becoming a catastrophe.I LOVE the fact Heidi Klum, , is so evidently over the moon about being married to musician Tom Kaulitz,  . . . and he is just as happy.In snaps of the pair having dinner in West Hollywood on Wednesday night, she is beaming with pride.Never mind the -year age gap. They both seem to be having a thoroughly nice time together.THERE is no doubt Megxit has put more pressure on William and Kate to meet the public’s expectations and live their lives in the spotlight.While it’s a huge shame Harry and Meghan felt they had no choice but to leave the country, the Cambridges are stepping up to the plate.On their three-day tour of Ireland they have met hundreds of people and posed for countless selfies during an exhausting itinerary.They have visited mental health charities, met farmers and poured oil on potentially troubled waters by speaking at a reception in Dublin about the “many wrongs” Ireland has suffered and our “complex” shared history.They tried their hand at everything from pulling pints to juggling, all the time with smiles on their faces.Some people think that it must be easy being a royal but I defy anyone to do as much as they do in a day, making people feel at ease in their company and all without grumbling.They make a good team and seem genuinely happy to share their lives with us. They will make a great king and queen.SOBERING findings from the United Nations should give us all pause for thought on International Women’s Day.Nine in ten people around the globe are prejudiced against women, it found.That includes depressing notions such as a university education being more important for men than for women and that blokes are more deserving of the jobswork is scarce.Half of the world’s men AND WOMEN feel that fellas make better political leaders, while more than  per cent feel men make better business executives.It is not wholly surprising, I guess,chaps think that way. But these numbers reflect how a horrying number of women think this way too.I guess this is in part due to the received ideas that have formed the backbone of our culture for far too long. That is something for us all to reflect on and challenge wherever we can from now on.ANY woman over  who feels inadequate looking at the drop-dead gorgeousness of Elizabeth Hurley, , can stop the comparisons.It turns out Liz is human after all. Talking to her old friend Trinny Woodall, Liz revealed that she sleeps in a bra every night to keep her cleavage “high and firm” and keeps gaffer tape in her handbag.Gaffer tape, she says, is the secret to her impressive cleavage when she wears plunging dresses.“I wouldn’t be without it,” she said. “I’m obsessed with it. I use it for everything. I have gaffer-taped my body before and it’s the best. There’s nothing better.”Mind you, Liz also claimed she never exercises. Which just goes to show that much of how we look is down to good fortune . . . and good genes.PERHAPS the best thing about getting married for a second time is this: The pressure to do it any way but your way is OFF.I love the fact that when Kate Garraway renews her vows with husband Derek Draper later this year, she is handing the planning reins for the ceremony to her teenage daughter.What a lovely way for the pair to include her. Although having a -year-old arrange your wedding could be . . . interesting.Some people don’t like the idea of renewing wedding vows. But I think it’s romantic.And since anything goes,my husband Paul and I ever do it, the ceremony will be in Las Vegas . . . with me dressed as Elvis.HOW sad – and how shocking – to read a new report saying hundreds of children died or were victims of abuse and neglect AFTER concerns for their welfare had already been raised with social services.It is incredibly dficult being a social worker. It’s one of the most stressful jobs there is.I sometimes wonder why the extended families of at-risk children are not more involved, often not until its too late.Social workers need more funding, more power to take action and all the training that can be made available to them.Maybe that would encourage more people to go into this vital service.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The government says an “omission” in guidance issued in  and not corrected until  has left families stuck, Nottinghamshire Live reports. This meant families from several eastern European countries were not asked for full documentation when initially applying for British passports for their children born in the UK. Marlena, from Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, realised she fell foul of this error when looking to renew her sonaposs passport. The nationwide error may have affected families from Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia who were required to register under the Workers Registration Scheme - a residency paperwork scheme that was scrapped in .

But Oscar knows they will never go hungry - thanks to the work of the L community centre. In the shadow of Everton FC’s Goodison Park ground, it’s a leline for thousands of families like Oscar’s. It runs a food bank, a baby bank, a school unorm “shop”, a youth club, holiday club, a free launderette and much, much more. Without the L - which gets no government funding at all, relying instead on grants, donations and fundraising - thousands of families would literally not be able to survive.Oscar spoke to the Mirror as we launch our Give Me Five campaign . We are calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty.Oscar, eight, says: “I love coming here as I get to play with my friends. And the food is really good - my favourite tea is Shepherd’s Pie. “I know my dad only gets money on a Thursday and sometimes he runs out. I open the fridge sometimes and there is no food. If he got an extra £ a week he would be able to get more shopping in for us.” Oscar’s dad Danny is one of L’s success stories. Eight years ago he was drinking, taking drugs, living on the streets - and his newborn son was on the verge of being adopted. But with the support of L’s chief executive Gerard Woodhouse, Danny managed to turn his le around - and get custody of his son. Gerard says: “Nothing shocks me any more. I’ve known families go without food for five days before coming to us for help. We buy beds for children who have been sleeping on the sofa or a mattress on the floor because their parents can’t afford to buy them a bed. “We are just a community centre - we should be putting on ballroom dancing, bingo and youth clubs. But instead  per cent of the work we do is around poverty. “Last year we made almost , donations of food, clothes, toys and hampers. We sent out , Christmas dinners. On Christmas Eve we open until midnight because people who have been too proud to ask for help before then panic and come to us as they have nothing to give their kids for Christmas. “I remember two years ago we got a call late Christmas Eve - we went round and the family had nothing. And the saddest thing was the kids had drawn a Christmas tree on the wall because they couldn’t afford to buy a tree. “I came back to the centre, took down all our decorations and took them round to that family’s house, along with toys and food.” We spent the day at the centre to see first-hand the work they do on the very frontline of Britain’s poverty crisis. It is am on Monday morning and there is a queue of people snaking around the L building. It is the first day of the centre’s new food union project - where people can pay £. and choose  “luxury” items of shopping. Things that most of us would see as bare essentials are classed as luxuries here - toilet roll, shampoo, nappies, sanitary products, toothpaste. These are things that parents would otherwise have to go withoutthey want to feed their children. Families have to make tough choices here - feed their kids, or heat their home, or buy toilet roll. Gerard says: “I had one little boy in here the other day. He ran straight to the loo and was in and out in a minute. I said to him “that was quick” and he said I just had to go in and wipe my bum as we have no loo roll at home.” That is the stark reality of how tough things are for people around here. Gerard decided to launch the food union as he knows that out of pride people are reluctant to go to a food bank. This way they get to make a contribution to their shopping and don’t feel like they are accepting charity. Looking through the centre’s referral files - where teachers, doctors and social workers refer families in desperate of need of help - makes sobering reading. Family after family unable to feed their children due to changes in their benefits, working parents unable to make ends meet, women fleeing domestic violence.And two words keep being repeated over and over again..... Universal Credit . Since the introduction of the controversial benefit, the L has seen a  percent increase in referrals. Universal Credit was rolled out in Liverpool in December , and since then delays in payments, sanctions and reduction of benefits have all taken their toll. Gerard says: “The payment now goes to one person in the household. Sothe dad misses an appointment at the job centre, the whole family’s money can be stopped. For me,the dad does something wrong, stop his money, but don’t stop the money for the kids. “In this area  per cent of working people are still living in poverty. A lot of our mothers are proud to work - but they are on zero hours contracts so they don’t know how much money they will be earning from one month to the next. They might sign their child up for a school trip - but then the next month their hours get cut and they can’t afford it.” But Universal Credit and zero hours contracts aren’t the only problem in Liverpool Six. Gerard says the area is re with loan sharks who prey on the most vulnerable, and drug abuse is also a big issue. He says: “The loan sharks all have their own patches -  streets each - and the don’t stray onto each other’s patch. We had one woman who took out a £ loan - which with interest then spiralled to £,. She was forced into prostitution to try to pay it back and provide for her kids. “Drugs are so cheap - they can get a hit for a tenner. You see the drug dealers waiting on the corner outside school for the parents after they have dropped their kids off. They wait outside the local shops, the post office - first thing in the morning when people have taken their money out.”Gerard says that another major fear for mums in this area is having their children removed by social services.He says: “I went to a safeguarding meeting last week where they were worried because the mum wasn’t taking her baby with her to school when she dropped her older children off. I asked her why she wasn’t taking the baby with her - it was because she didn’t have a pram.” One desperate mum-to-be has come to the centre for help this morning. Rosemary Connolly, , is seven months months pregnant, her boyfriend has been jailed and she doesn’t have a single thing ready for her baby girl’s arrival - no cot, no pram, not even a baby bottle - and she has no money to buy anything. She explains: “I’ve only got  weeks until my baby is due but I haven’t got a thing. My boyfriend just smoked weed all the time - that’s where all his money and my money went. “I get £ a fortnight benefits but that is to pay for everything - food, electricity, travel. I can barely survive day to day on that - never mind having to try to pay for all the stuff you need for a baby. “I’ve offended in the past and I could go out and shoplt the stuff but I’d be terried of getting caught and having my baby taken away. “There are times when I’ve had to miss meals because I’ve got no money - I think that is why my baby bump is so small. “I’ve had pre-eclampsia because of the stress - I was terried of going into labour and not having the stuff for the baby. You don’t want to admit to anyone that you’ve got nothing - you don’t want people to judge you or look down on you.”  The centre has its own “baby bank” - a shipping container in the car park filled to the brim with everything a new mum would need for her baby - all brand new. Volunteer Irene Rainey helps Rosemary pick out everything she needs for her baby girl - who she is going to call Fleur - from a cot, pram and car seat, down to vests, nappies and babygros. Rosemary’s eyes fills with tears as she is handed £, worth of essentials for her unborn child. She says: “I just feel so relieved to have been able to come here - it is like a weight lted from me. I feel like Gerard is myangel. I’m crying now because I am so relieved and grateful. I feel like I’ve won the lottery.” Irene also runs the centre’s “unorm shop” - another shipping container full of school unorms from dozens of pairs of brand new school shoes, to winter coats, PE kits, and branded school sweatshirts. Every child referred can get £ worth of brand new unorm - and last year the centre kitted out almost , children - with  per cent of those being kids whose parents work on zero hour contracts. Irene explains: “Some of them are in desperate situations through no fault of their own. “There are mums who have four or five kids but can’t feed them as they have been waiting eight weeks for their universal credit. “They have to get those kids to school somehow but can barely feed them.  “We make sure that those children all have a brand new school unorm. At the start of a school term we hand out hundreds of unorms, hundreds. I don’t see this as charity though. It is a community coming together to support each other, look out for each other. Shoplting is a another huge problem in this area - desperate, poverty-stricken parents feel they have no choice but to steal basic items like nappies, sanitary products and toothpaste. So Gerard and the local supermarket devised a scheme where the store would not prosecute parents caught stealing those basic items - as long as they agreed to attend a course at L. Gerard says: “People stealing food or nappies, orthey tell the store that they have stolen because they needed to sell it to pay for something , then the store agreed not to prosecutethey engaged with us. “We work with them, we tell them what is right and wrong, then we check all their benefits. We get them doing cooking, how to make healthy meals on a budget, they cook for the youth club. Then we get them volunteering in the centre. About  people have been through this scheme so far and it has been successful.”  At pm the youth club opens and children come straight from school for activities - and more importantly food and warmth. Gerard says: “ it wasn’t for this club, some of these kids might not get a hot meal tonight. There wouldn’t be any heating on at home and most likely they would be hanging out in the streets. “The parents like their kids coming here because they know they are safe, warm and fed.” In the summer holidays many families reach crisis point with no school breakfast clubs or free school meals to fill the kids bellies.  L steps in and cooks around  breakfasts each day,  two course lunches and then they send the kids home with an evening meal as well. The centre has a launderette and around  families a week come into do their laundry for free. Gerard says: “They don’t even have to pay for washing powder. We have had kids come here who smell because their clothes are dirty and other kids can be very cruel. So we always make sure that kids have access to clean clothes. “Nothing surprises me any more - people will come in and say they have seen kids in the bins outside looking for food. That is just normal here now. It is another world and the sad fact is that there are lots of places like this.” aposI don’t want him to go withoutapos  Oscar’s dad Danny Casey says: “When I was  I found my mum dead in bed, but two weeks before that I had found out that the man who brought me up wasn’t my dad. So I was left on my own. My brother died a year later when he was , so then I went off the rails. Taking drugs, drinking, I became homeless and lived on the streets for two years. “I started robbing out of shops to survive, and then I met Gerard and he took me in. But I didn’t change - I was still doing drugs, I used to steal off him, I treated him terribly. “But then I got to the age of  and I realised I was either going to die or end up in jail. Then I got a letter from the courts saying my ex-girlfriend was pregnant and the baby was going to be put up for adoption. “It was the wake-up call I needed, I knew I had to fight for my son - I haven’t touched a single drug since. I had to go for weekly drug tests, I had to do parenting classes - I would be the only male in the room. “Eventually I got him back when he was eight months old. It was amazing - I have never cried so much in my le. But I couldn’t have done it without the support of Gerard, Everton Nursery and the L. They still support me to this day. “The poverty we are going through at the minute is just ridiculous - people just can’t survive. We need more places like this. “I am a single dad, I can’t afford to go and buy in the big supermarkets. With Universal Credit you get paid monthly so you have to budget really carefully or your money doesn’t last. “Oscar wants everything and I don’t want him to go without - but I can’t afford everything.

The couple, making one of their final appearances before they quit as senior royals at the end of the month looked eyecatching at the Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington. Meghan, , donned a vivid £, gown from luxury Mayfair atelier Safiyaa. to match the Duke of Sussexaposs unorm - oozing confidence as she arrived at tonightaposs event. It is the second time the couple have colour coordinated as they made their glamorous final outings in London as part of their tour before they step aside from royal le. And while she might not appreciate the comparison, our expert Judi James believes there is a Melania Trump-esque side to her styling. Describing their co-ordinating outfits, Judi said: Red is the colour of extreme passions, from love right through to anger. It is also the colour of Harry’s unorm, meaning the duo have repeated their look of a tight, co-ordinated team of two here. Meghan’s choice of dress for one of her last appearances in the UK has to be seen as a version of non-verbal signalling as the message is so emphatic. This is not a sign of someone shying away from the public attention or spotlight, it suggests someone who is embracing it fully and with pride.The statuesque styling looks like a power statement as it closely mirrors the recent looks worn by the First Lady of America, Melania Trump , and Meghan’s body language reflects that mood of star status, confidence and resilience. Perhaps tonight was more dficult for Harry, who looked less at ease, Judi suggested. She said: Harry looks like a man in a hurry, striding out ahead as he leads his we by the hand, Meghan’s backward tilted posture looks straight off a runway as she smiles to engage with the crowds and her hosts.  Harry’s forehead looks shiny with what looks like sweat, suggesting some tension, and his rounded, reflective eye expression, his clasped hands, and his finger-fiddling gesture hint at mounting pressure. Meghan looks like a woman who is taking it all in her stride but he is beginning to look as though he might be struggling. The couple received long round of applause and a standing ovation from the crowd in the hall as they took their seats in the royal box as Harry appeared in his full Captain General unorm for what could be the last time.

Lance Shingler, , who was haunted by the death of nine pals in the Iraq War, died in front of Hayley Gough. She then had to tell their children, Riley, eight, and Elliey-Jaye, six, daddy had died. Hayley said Lance’s death last month had been the th suicide by members of The Rles regiment since . Lance knew at least six of them. Angry Hayley, , said: “He was screaming for help but no one was listening. “Too many members of The Rles have taken their own lives and no one in Government seems in the least bothered.” Birmingham City fan Lance’s picture was shown on a giant screen at the Championship side’s St Andrew’s ground on Saturday. A message read: “Fought to the end with a battle of PTSD. Fly high our beautul angel.” Lance had already been through hell with Fourth Battalion The Rles when he met Hayley in .

Hayley, from Birmingham, said: “Lance suffered from ­survivors guilt. A lot of his friends were killed. Lance ­wondered why he survived. “One of his friends had been shot in the head.

I just kept hitting hurdles all the time with no one really ­taking responsibility for what Lance was going through.” Lance’s HGV licence had been suspended because of his mental health. On February  he came home and tried to overdose on antipsychotic drugs he was taking. Hayley immediately called an ambulance. She said: “He seemed OK in ­hospital and I thought he would be fine but then he just died in front of me.” Hayley said the children are being very resilient about Lance’s death. “He adored them.

Meghan Markle painted the town red as she matched her vivid gown to her princeaposs unorm as they arrived to attend the annual Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington. The couple received a long round of applause and a standing ovation as they took their seats in the royal box as Harry appeared in his full Captain General unorm for what could be the last time. The Duke of Sussex, who served in Afghanistan, was made Captain General of the elite corps last year, replacing his grandfather Prince Philip. While Harry will be entitled to a small Army Pension in future as a retired officer, he is understood to be likely to lose the key role as head of the Royal Marines once he Meghan begin their new le outside the royal family. Meghan is wearing what appears to be a gown from luxury Mayfair atelier Safiyaa. Her stunning gown appears to be one from the British fashion houseaposs collection, the Gingko crepe cape, which is currently retailing between £-£, online. Meghanaposs striking red shoes are by Italian luxury brand Aquazurra, her matching clutch is by Spanish fashion designer Manolo Blahnik, and earrings by Irish designer Simone Rocha. It is the second time the couple have colour coordinated as they made their glamorous final outings in London as part of their tour before they step aside from royal le. Meghan glowed in a blue Victoria Beckham dress and midnight blue pumps, matching her husbandaposs navy suit and blue tie as the beaming couple displayed a united front in London earlier this week.  The happy couple were pictured grinning at each other as they walked through the rain under an umbrella to attend the  Endeavour Awards.  Tonightaposs public outing for the Royal Marines Charity event is a milestone final appearance for Harry. He is attending his final annual performance of the Massed Bands of Her Royal Majestyaposs Royal Marines as a member of the Crown. The event tonight marks the th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the th anniversary of the formation of Britainaposs Commandoes. It is being held to fundraise for the Royal Marines Charity and CLIC Sargent. They will take their seats in the royal box, having been greeted by five members of the Royal Marines when they arrived at the venue in South Kensington. Harry and Meghan turned heads this week as they made their first big public appearance in Britain since beginning the first phase of their new le with son baby Archie in Canada, amid the royal split.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA cheeky teenager left the Duchess of Sussex speechless as stole a kiss and declared “she’s beautul” to a packed assembly hall during a secret royal visit to his school. Meghan appeared in front of stunned pupils at Robert Clack Upper School in Dagenham urging teenage boys to “value, appreciate and protect” the women in their lives. As part of her rallying speech to celebrate International Women’s Day - which falls tomorrow - the Duchess went “off the cuff” and invited one “brave young man” to go up to the stage to speak about why the anniversary was important to him. To wild applause, up stepped Aker Okoye, the -year-old Head Boy, before he made his way to the stage to greet Meghan with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Waiting until the noise died down before leaning into the microphone and telling them: She really is beautul, innit. The Duchess burst into laughter, wagging her finger at him in mock admonishment and crossing her arms. “I had to speak the truth there,” he added. International Women’s Day is a reminder to everyone that women can do it all and do do it all. “This is more of a message to all you guys. Maybe this Sunday could be the one day we don’t look at women as objects.  “I just want International Women’s Day for all of us to be a reminder of how strong our community is with women inside. To screams and applause, he gave Meghan a hug and left the stage as she said: Well done. Very well said. And incredible confidence, wonapost you all agree  Speaking afterwards, Aker said calling Meghan beautul was an “ice-breaker”. He added: “Itaposs dferent when you meet people in person from on TV. Itaposs a dferent feeling. “Sorry about the ice-breaker, I donapost want to objecty women. It was amazing.”  Asked how he thought his peers would react, he said: “Itaposs going to be for a few days, theyaposre going to be asking me questions. I had to stand up. I looked around, I wasnapost sure there was anybody  [volunteering]. I thought: this day means so much to me, it would be an insult for me not to speak and say how much it means to me.” On what he was thinking as he approached the stage, he said: Donapost mess up, donapost mess up.My heart was racing because I knew I had to speak in front of all of my cohort. I was really amazed and surprised.”  Saying he had only learned Meghan was coming towards the end of the school day, he added: “It means a lot to have her here. Itaposs not every day that you meet someone from the royal family.” During the visit, Meghan’s last solo engagement before leaving the Royal Family, she appeared alongside a real-le “Dagenham Girl” who fought for equal pay at the nearby Ford factory, the Duchess told youngsters: “No matter how small you might feel… you have a voice and you certainly have the right to speak up for what is right.” Meeting Geraldine Dear, , one of the women who took part in the  strike for equal pay at the Ford Motor Plant in Dagenham, Meghan told her: “Well done on making such an important change for this country. Iaposm sure itaposs not an easy thing to do but itaposs the right thing to do. After a few moments of conversation with a class the Duchess walked out of the building to see a corridor of around  pupils who had been assembled to cheer their mystery guest.  One guessed the Queen would be arriving, while others had sussed it was the Duchess of Sussex. Other possibilities, student leaders later disclosed, included Boris Johnson, Jackie Chan, and Beyonce. In the the assembly, in front of a display reading How the Women of Dagenham Change the World, around  students heard from head girl Renee Palmer-Davies and Rhyanna Williams, both , who spoke about the women who inspired them. They had been told about the Duchess’s visit two weeks in advance to allow them to prepare, successfully keeping the secret from their friends, family and school.  Taking to the stage, Meghan said: It is such an honour for me to be here today. When we thought about what I wanted to do for International Womenaposs Day this year, for me it was incredibly important to be with the women of our future. And that is all of you young women here as well as you young men who play a very large part in this. I think specically coming to your school made a lot of sense for me because of this social justice and the impact that itaposs rooted in.  Your school mantra, as you all know is what  Excellence for all, excellence from all, right  Sothataposs the case, how does that apply in your mind, do you think, to International Womenaposs Day  I think itaposs very much the same thing isnapost it  This idea of excellence for all and from all equality for all and from all. Pupil Rhyanna Williams said: Especially in Dagenham, you think itaposs a forgotten part of London. To have a royal at your school makes you think: weaposre important, we matter.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum gives birth ford focus","story":"NewsMum gave birth when head appeared mid-journey as mph Ford Focus hurtled down roadAmy Russell, , said her heart still speeds up as she recalls partner Dan Hornsey, , speeding through North Devon before their daugher Elsie was born at Tiverton and District HospitalShareCommentsBySusan ClarkErin CardfAmardeep Bassey:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBaby Elsie with mum Amy Russell, who was born during a mph dash in a Ford Focus \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum gave birth in the passenger seat of a Ford Focus as her partner drove at mph down a country lane in a frantic effort to get her to hospital. Amy Russell, , said her heart still speeds up as she recalls Dan Hornsey, , speeding through North Devon before their daugher Elsie was born. Panicked Dan said he saw a big, red slimy ball poking between Amyaposs legs, and was horried to learn it was the babyaposs head. Amy said, Wales Online reports: “I told Dan I needed to take my trousers down.” She continued: “He thought I was joking, but I felt like I had to push and you can’t stop that from happening. “I knew whether we got to hospital or not that our baby was coming there and then!” At that point they were closer to Tiverton and District Hospital, which was  minutes nearer than Exeter, so Dan decided the best thing he could do was try to make it there, even though no one was expecting them. He said: “I didn’t stop or pull over, because I knew I was close to the hospital. “I also knew I could get there before an ambulance would find us in the Devon lanes.” Then Dan glanced over and saw “a big, red, slimy ball” poking out between Amy’s legs. “I panicked a bit when I saw that and Amy told me it was the baby’s head,” he said.  “It was crazy. “I looked back at the road briefly and I then looked back to see Amy pulling Elsie out, which was when I realised she was delivering the baby herself. “Amy was strapped in with a seatbelt, Elsie was lying on her lap and the umbilical cord was still attached, so I was really panicking.”  He continued: “I had my hand on the horn, the headlights flashing and when we got to the hospital, where nobody was expecting us because we were supposed to go to Exeter, I was about a metre away from driving through the front door!” Amy, who is also mum to Hope, five, her daughter from a previous relationship, remembers waking up on the morning of December , , two days before her due date, feeling pain reminiscent of contractions. A full-time mum, she said: “It felt like I was having contractions but my waters hadn’t broken, so I called the midwe who said everything was perfectly normal.” Amy continued: “She suggested I have a hot bath, which would either speed things up or slow things down, so I went to run it, but never actually had one.” Meanwhile, Dan went to wake Hope, reassuring her that her mum was fine, but had a few tummy  pains, so she needed to get up and go to her grandparents’ house soon.  “I was just talking to Hope, nice and chilled, when Amy stuck her head around the door about  minutes in and said, ‘Dan, I need to talk to you,’” he recalled. While her waters still had not broken, before she could climb into the bath her mucus plug – which blocks the cervix during pregnancy – had come out, which usually indicates labour will follow shortly. “I wasn’t expecting to hear that, so that’s probably when I felt the first small panic,” said Dan. “I called my dad, Dave, who picked Hope up to take her to Nana Cyndi’s, then we phoned Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where we were scheduled to give birth.” He continued: “They asked how far away we were, and when we said a  or  minute drive, they said that was fine and I started packing the car, so we could drive there. “When I went back to the house, Amy was on all fours in the hallway having a bad contraction, but because she stayed so calm, so did I.”  But Amy, a former carer, admits the contractions were much worse than she had let on. She said: “I wasn’t sure I would even make it to the car. How I got up off the floor and managed to get into the car I just don’t know. “I knew I needed to make sure Dan was calm, so he could drive safely, though. “Andthere’s one thing I learnt from this experience, it’s that Dan is an excellent driver!” The couple, who had been together for a year and knew they were having a girl, then set off to drive through the twisty Devon lanes in the rain to Exeter. As Amy’s contractions worsened, however, Dan had a change of plan. He said:  “Amy’s contractions started getting stronger, more painful and more frequent, until she said to me, ‘I don’t think we’re going to make it to Exeter.apos”  He added: “A bit of panic started kicking in and I began driving faster, then taking the fork in the road to Tiverton, not Exeter, as it’s nearer. “The lanes are windy and full of potholes, so poor Amy was being bumped around. “At that moment, I turned into Lewis Hamilton. My adrenaline was rushing, but I still wasn’t freaking out.” But what came next would send even the coolest character into a flap. Amy recalled: “I had put my hands down to see what was happening, because in one of the last scans, Elsie had been lying sideways. “Now, one of my main worries, was what would happenshe did not come out head first.” She added: “I was expecting to feel hairit was her head, because we’d seen on the scans that she had a lot of hair, but I couldn’t feel any.  “Instead, she felt slimy, so I thought, ‘Oh my God, she’s come out breech!’ “I looked and saw the top of her ear, so realised she was coming out still in the amniotic sac, which didn’t burst until her elbows emerged.” Amy said: “My first words to her were, ‘You’re OK! Don’t cry!” With no idea how long the umbilical cord was, Amy just kept baby Elsie safe on her lap, tucked against her stomach, snuggled into the long, warm cardigan she was wearing. Finally arriving at the hospital, Dan left the engine running and the car doors open, as he dashed inside to find help, running along the corridors until he saw two people in medical unorms. Noting the panic on his face and in his voice, they ran back to the car with him and, as they wheeled Amy and Elsie, who weighed lb oz, onto a ward, Dan finally cracked – falling to his knees in shock.  Then, as mum and daughter were checked over and given a clean bill of health, he was able to cut the umbilical cord – one of the only things about Elsie’s delivery that went according to plan. Soon after, Hope – who loves telling people how her baby sister was born in a car – visited, before the couple spent New Year’s Eve on the empty maternity ward, watching the countdown to  and the London fireworks on TV. Now, a few months on, Dan says even talking about what happened sparks a physical reaction.

The monarch and her security team were thwarted as they attempted to sweep into Windsor Castle in two Range Rovers on Thursday afternoon. Her Majesty, wearing a headscarf and sitting in the back seat, was kept waiting outside the Nelson’s Gate entrance after a member of staff apparently forgot to let her in. Pictures showed how a female bodyguard got out of the vehicle and attempted in vain to open the heavy wooden gate blocking their entrance. The bodyguard also delivered a kick to a side door in an attempt to alert staff inside about the Queenaposs presence.

Diana admitted in a BBC Panorama interview that Camilla was a factor in the breakdown of her relationship with Charles, whom she started dating when she was  and he was .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailOur royals really need to choose their mates more wisely. What we’ve heard this week about Dubai’s billionaire ruler should be enough to get The Firm hitting the unfriend button pronto. It was reported yesterday that the Queen was planning to “distance” herself from the Sheikh – and rightly so. Here is a father who we hear has kidnapped two of his daughters – one off the streets of Britain – before locking them up in his palace. One even said she had been tortured. He denies doing any of this, but a High Court judge found that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum waged a campaign of “fear and intimidation” against his sixth and youngest we, Princess Haya, who fled here “in utter terror” and in fear of her le. But this brute has houses in Britain and is chummy with our royals, sharing a love of racehorses – last year he got a trophy from the Queen at Ascot. The past few months have rocked our royal family, with Prince Andrew, Harry and Meghan creating enough drama to make an award-winning boxset. So the last thing the Queen – or any of her offspring – needs is to be associated with him. Her Majesty is respected around the world for her tireless work and diplomacy. She needs to protect her reputation and shake off this sheikh and sever all ties... like his ex-we Princess Haya has fought to do, taking their children with her. And this is a man with dozens of children from six dferent wives, and he rules with much controversy and disregard for human rights.  Princess Lata, one of Sheikh Mohammed’s adult daughters with another we, fled for her le in  – jumping in a dinghy to escape his grasp and claim asylum in the US. In Dubai she wasn’t allowed the freedoms we take for granted. Yes, she has money but she has been oppressed since the day she was born. Her escape plan failed and desperate Lata was dragged back to Dubai at gunpoint. And it’s thought her treatment back there is one of the reasons Princess Haya had the courage to leave. It’s not the princess dream little girls have, is it  Britain must take a stand against this man instead of indulging him. This misogyny has no place in a modern world. For many women in Dubai, their country is a gilded cage with pots of cash but next to no freedom.  If we must keep dealing with him, we need to lay down some ground rules. Princess Lata should be allowed to leave Dubai and travel where she wants to. These aren’t “private family matters”, like the sheikh claims. Keeping her there is a violation of her human rights. We’d also love to know what happened to her sister Shamsa, kidnapped in the UK in  and forced back to Dubai.

That means gangs see them as quick money and, sadly, they get ­shipped from Russia with health problems. Jan said: “We’re picking up the pieces, doing all the rehoming. “Most of the problems are when people have bought bad ones from Russia or eastern Europe, where they don’t ­conform to the breed standard. Their pedigrees are wrong. They are ill. They’ve got faults. There is a lot of smuggling going on.” The breed emerged in the s in Canada, the product of a genetic ­mutation in a litter. When Tulip arrived in Britain, there were thought to be only four others in the world – one in France, one in Switzerland and two in Holland.  Jan, who lives in Christchurch, Dorset, describes them as ­being “part dog, part monkey, part cat” and says they “should feel like a warm peach”. Despite their bald appearance they have a fine, downy hair. But they lose more body heat than your average cat so they are warmer to the touch and are keener to seek out sources of heat. Known for being smart show-offs, they have heaps of energy and ­affection for their owners.

The appeal of their offbeat motoring chic is huge. And, like great Hollywood stars, their classic style is always in fashion. The first rolled out of a factory  years ago this month. Since then the iconic vans have launched millions on the open road. Everyone from families on summer ­holidays to surfers heading for the coast and hippies hitting rock festivals have ­cherished their faithful VW. They have featured in films such as Field of Dreams, What’s Up, Doc  and Little Miss Sunshine. Former Formula One world champ Jenson Button, , drives one, as does TV chef Jamie Oliver, , and The Greatest Showman star Hugh Jackman, . Some celebs are such fans that they have used VW campers on their wedding day, including Vernon Kay, , and Tess Daly, , in  and singer Ellie Goulding, , last year. The spacious vehicle, a ­forerunner of the now common ­minibus, began le in the sketchbook of an importer called Ben Pon.  He visited the VW factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, with the ­intention of bringing Beetles to the Netherlands. Engineers were so impressed by the ­modications they ­decided to use them to design the next ­generation of the Type  Beetle, the Type  camper van. The new model was unveiled at the  Geneva Motor Show then went on sale in March .  It was initally available in two dferent models – the Transporter, a traditional cargo van, and the Kombi which had seats in the back. Early models sold for £, equivalent to £, in today’s money. Such has been their huge popularity, a modern day camper will set you back £,. The early model’s relative low cost were key to their attraction to the hippy ­generation of the late s and early s.  Young people who embraced the counter culture of the day, which included opposing the Vietnam War, ­took to the Type  because it was ­affordable, big enough to sleep in and ­recognisably not American. The original Type  was never built to go fast – with a top speed of mph – but its lack of performance has not limited its appeal even to the most ardent petrol heads. Ex-Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond, , is a proud owner.Other famous fans include Trainspotting star Ewan McGregor, , and Desperate Housewe Teri Hatcher, . The van inspired The Who hit Magic Bus and the band’s singer Roger Daltrey, , owns one. While Jamie Oliver’s blue model, which appeared in his  TV series Jamie’s Great Italian Escape, was driven by Top Gear’s The Stig as the terried chef tried to rustle up a salad in the back. Instagram even has a dedicated hashtag #vanle, featuring old and new VWs converted into bohemian homes.Since the creation of the camper there have been ten ­dferent versions – from the hippy van of the s to the modern ­transporter we know today. But the quirkiest of models are often the bespoke modications carried out by owners who convert their vans into unique spaces. Creative Camper fans have turned their Type ’s into coffee shops, cocktail bars, discos and even DJ booths.  After  years as the undisputed king of cool on the road, Volkswagen is showing no sign of giving up on the camper van. In a nod to the flower power generation who made it famous, the German car giant has announced plans for the Volkswagen I.D. Buzz, an eco-friendly electric version of the model for .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Queen is set to distance herself from the ruler of Dubai after a court ruled that he abducted and detained his daughters against their will. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ordered and orchestrated the abduction and forcedto Dubai of Sheikha Shamsa, then , in August  and her sister Sheikha Lata twice, in  and again in , according to a damning judgment published on Thursday. The confirmation of long-standing rumours surrounding Sheikh Mohammedaposs two daughters came out of his legal battle with ex-we Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, , the half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan, over their two children. The Queen and Sheikh Mohammed have previously been pictured together at horse racing events and he has been invited to the Royal Box at Ascot. But The Times reported she will refuse to be photographed with him or the princess in public following the court case.  Princess Haya asked the High Court to make a series of findings of fact about Sheikh Mohammed, in particular in relation to the kidnap and forcible detention of his two adult daughters, who are from another marriage almost two decades apart. Shamsa, now , was abducted from the streets of Cambridge on August , , and has never been seen in public since.  Now Cambridgeshire Police have confirmed aspects of their  probe - which found insufficient evidence to take any action - will be revisited, although the force insisted the investigation was no longer active. A spokeswoman said: An investigation into the alleged abduction of Shamsa Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum in  was carried out by Cambridgeshire Constabulary in . With the evidence that was available to us this was insufficient to take any further action. A review took place in  and it was again concluded there was insufficient evidence to take any further action. This is no longer an active investigation and we are not in contact with the victim.  The burden of proof and evidential requirements are signicantly dferent in family court proceedings to that of criminal proceedings, however, in light of the recent release of the judgment, aspects of the case will now be subject to review. At the High Court, Princess Haya asked Sir Andrew McFarlane, the most senior family judge in England and Wales, to make findings of fact about Sheikh Mohammed in relation to his application for contact with their daughter Al Jalila, , and son Zayed, eight. Sir Andrew explained in his judgment that a substantial element in the extreme concernhas for the future well-being of her children arises from her belief that Shamsa and Lata have been and are deprived of their liberty on an open-ended basis.  In his judgment, Sir Andrew said Shamsa contacted an immigration solicitor - who cannot be named for legal reasons - in June , saying she was estranged from her father and asking for advice on how she might be able to remain in the UK. The judge stated: He heard nothing further from her until he was informed by police in August  that Shamsa may have been abducted. But, in February , the solicitor received an email said to be from Shamsa - sent by one of her sisters - which read: I was caught on August , in Cambridge. Hesent four Arab men to catch me, they were carrying guns and threatening me, they drove me to my fatheraposs place in Newmarket, there they gave me two injections and a handful of tablets, the very next morning a helicopter came and flew me to the plane, which took me back to Dubai. I am locked up until today.  The email added: I told you this would happen ... I know these people, they have all the money, they have all the power, they think they can do anything. Shamsa also provided another account of her abduction, leaving an answerphone message on the telephone of a complete stranger on August , saying she had been ed to Dubai against her will and asking for her solicitor to be informed. DCI David Beck led Cambridgeshire Policeaposs investigation into her disappearance, and discovered the arrival and departure of a helicopter which travelled from Newmarket to France at am on August . The officer sought permission from the Crown Prosecution Service to visit Dubai to interview potential witnesses, but his request was refused. At a hearing in November, Princess Hayaaposs barrister Charles Geekie QC told the court that DCI Beckaposs evidence made clear that there had been interference in the police inquiry.  In his judgment, Sir Andrew said the Foreign and Commonwealth Officehad confirmed it held information relating to the investigation of Shamsaaposs alleged kidnapping. But the FCO refused to disclose it, saying that releasing information on this issue would increase public knowledge about our relations with UAE and would reduce the UK Governmentaposs ability to protect and promote UK interests through its relations with UAE which would not be in the public interest. Sir Andrew concluded: It is not possible to find on the balance of probability that permission for Mr Beck to visit Dubai was refused because of the direct intervention of the FCO, nor, moving further still from the basic known facts, that any intervention by the FCO had been triggered by the father or the government of Dubai.  Lataaposs high-profile attempt to flee the UAE in  became public after a video account of her abduction and imprisonment at the hands of her father was published on YouTube in March of that year. But her failed bid for freedom was not the first time she tried to leave the emirate, having attempted to run away in  before being stopped at the border with Oman and ed to the family home. Lata said in her  video that she was held against her will after that escape attempt until October , during which time she was subjected to constant torture. The judge added that the cooperation of the Indian military in the operation to capture Lata demonstrated Sheikh Mohammed and the UAEaposs signicant international respect and influence. Lata was seen in public in December , when Princess Haya invited her friend Mary Robinson - former president of Ireland - to visit Dubai to establish proof of le.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Person-wearing-Medical-Face-Mask-to-protect-against-Coronavirus-Covid-19_34708990-907x564.jpg ","title":"dundees most vulnerable residents worried by coronavirus spread","story":"The most vulnerable of Dundee#s population have been left worried by infection as coronavirus spreads across the country.Members of the city#s homeless community have expressed concerns that they may be unable to keep clean or self-isolate following the confirmation of three cases of the virus in Scotland.The disease, which has infected more than , people and claimed more than , lives, struck Scotland on Sunday after a case was confirmed in Tayside.Clayre Stewart, a homeless woman who sleeps rough in Dundee, is worried that the virus will be able to spread to her easily.She said: #It didn#t worry me until I saw people out wearing masks yesterday afternoon.#People like me have got nowhere that we can feel safe.

They treat us like we#re a piece of dirt.#The -year-old is also worried that a lack of information may be a problem for those living on the street.She said: #I don#t have a phone, so I can#t get information on the virus.#I think folks like me should maybe get wee safety leaflets and some little bottles of hand sanitiser from the government.#Jim Stewart, another beggar from Dundee, said: #I#m not worried, I#ve got to die sometime.#I got some hand sanitiser at my brother#s house.#I don#t have access to hot water, and I don#t knowthere#s any places for a bath or a shower that I can go to.#I suppose diseases do get to homeless people, but I#m lucky enough to have a doctor who I would go toI started showing symptoms.#The elderly in Tayside have also shown great concern for the virus.It has been confirmed that the virus, which has a mortality rate of around %, is especially dangerous for older people who have underlying health conditions.According to a study from the Chinese government, just under % percent of people over the age of  who contract the virus are killed by it.Dorothy McHugh, the secretary of Dundee#s Pensioner Forum, said that the disease is worrying many older people in Dundee.She said: #It was raised at our most recent pensioners# forum, and older people are concerned about it.#Many of us are more vulnerable and frail, so we can be more badly-effected by it.#We discussed the importance of proper hand washing, which is already something pensioners take seriously.#We#re waiting to see how it develops and act accordingly.#The secretary also expressed concern that self isolation could have a negative impact on elderly people.She said: #My worry is that two weeks of self isolation could be really bad for older people and cause further social isolation.#I#m worried that people will avoid gatherings and just stay inside.#A lack of faith in the NHS has also caused Dundee pensioners to worry about possibly becoming sick.Dorothy said: #We know about the under-funding of the NHS.

He was ill at Queen of the South and, maybe stupidly, I played him when he wasn’t right.“But he’s now almost recovered and we’ll have him back for Saturday.”Dundee may have drawn a blank against the Wasps, but McPake was as delighted with his side’s performance as he was annoyed by the result.The Dark Blues fired  shots at the Alloa goal to no avail.Yet McPake took heart from the creative nature of his side’s showing ahead of a potentially pivotal double-header with play-off rivals Ayr.“We’ll take the positives for Saturday, we’re going down to Ayr then they’re coming here,” said McPake. vw, px\"  “It’s two massive games for our football club and,we perform like that, then we’ll give ourselves a right good chance.“At the minute, it’s sore but, though it was only one point, it’s another clean sheet. That’s one positive.“Another is, you could pick probably four or five games from earlier in the season and add our chances up – and we created more chances last night.“And the fans – for me that’s a positive because people keep saying they get on the players’ backs.“That’s rightly so because we haven’t been creating chances and giving them something to cheer, but you certainly heard them last night.“They were egging us on and really pushing.“I turned round during the game and said, ‘The atmosphere’s back’, and we need that.“It’s not a cry for help, but we need to keep producing performances like that to keep the atmosphere up, to keep the fans onside.“To keep them helping us we need performances like last night – with the goals added.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e62125da4da53.74996896.jpg ","title":"massive ayr clashes wont overawe christie elliott","story":"Christie Elliott hasn’t lost in a Dundee shirt.Andthe Dark Blues keep playing the way they have been, he doesn’t see why that should change.Former Partick Thistle man Elliott’s arrival at Dens has coincided with a four-game unbeaten run.The timing could hardly be better ahead of back-to-back clashes with play-off rivals Ayr United.For Elliott, it has been a dream start.But there has been one shock to deal with – the fact that the Dee haven’t already secured a top-four place.“Four games without losing is a good way to start with a new club – especially one as massive as Dundee,” said Elliott.“From this point, it’s all about consistency. We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night. We just need to put those away going forward.“Alloa was a crazy game. When you look back at how many chances we created – good chances too. In a normal game they go in and it’s -.“It’s one of those things. We’ve taken a lot of positives from it and we’ll take them into the Ayr game.“I’m surprised, from the way I’ve seen us play, that we’re not further up the league.“The squad is a really good one. I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here. Everyone in and around the club is great and I would love to stay herethe club want me.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee finding form as united stutter on title march","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, Sean Hamilton and Graeme Finnan dissect Dundee’s recent upturn in fortunes, discuss what United need to do to get their title march back on course and Billy Gilmour – is he good enough to be capped Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e621255e805a3.39290847-scaled.jpg ","title":"reynolds fresh united need not worry about ict in title approach","story":"Captain Mark Reynolds believes a re-invigorated Dundee United side should have no concerns about Inverness as they aim to sew up the Championship title.Reynolds insists United are not worrying about an ICT side who have closed the gap at the top to  points and have two games in hand as they enter the final round of fixtures against Partick Thistle at Tannadice tomorrow.What was otherwise a good point as the Terrors played out a goalless draw at Ayr United on Tuesday night was soured slightly by the Caley Jags’ late - win over Morton.However, defender Reynolds feels, with no more midweek games between now and the end of the season, the Tangerines have an advantage over their opponents with more hectic schedules.Askedhe was disappointed to discover Inverness had won, the -year-old said: “Not really. It is what it is with them, they’re going to pick up results.“We’re not at the stage where we’re worrying about Inverness yet. We just need to focus on our own business.“We need to find those performances and results again.“Every game is going to be tough and Inverness are going to push it all the way.“They need to keep winning and hope we keep slipping up, but there’s nine games to go and we just need to look after our own business.“We’re still only a few wins away from it so we just keep taking it one game at a time as our focus turns to Partick tomorrow.“This league is tough. It’s dficult just now but the run we were on was unbelievable.“To go those  games unbeaten was incredible and that’s what got us that cushion.“Everybody is capable of beating each other and it’s never an easy night.“We went down to Ayr and they’re a good side, pushing for second place. They’re having a good season, have good players and are playing some nice football.“We knew it was going to be tough with Inverness winning but they’ll need to keep plugging away.” vw, px\"  Of their own dip in form since the turn of the year, Reynolds added: “It is frustrating but it’s a long season with injuries, change of personnel and teams are fighting for their lives.“Every team knows they need to get something and they want to slow us down. It’s a cup final when teams play us. Inverness felt that when they played us the other week and it was the same for Ayr.“It’ll be a tough run-in with people taking points off each other but we just need to keep plugging away and re-focus.“Luckily, our schedule goes from weekend to weekend from now on so we can hit every game fresh, with teams coming in with strained squads playing Saturday-Tuesday.”Reynolds admits United are eager to get back on home soil after some tough games on the road.“Tannadice has been a good place for us and we’re looking forward to getting back on a nice pitch.“The pitch down at Ayr held up well considering the amount of rain we’ve had but it’s nice to get back home.“We need to keep going and pushing to make sure we get three points. I think there’s pressure on every game, home and away, when you play for Dundee United.“We’re coming into every game as the league leaders and it’s been like that all season, but we’ve managed to handle it so far.“We go into every game confident we can win but we know that’s not going to happen. If you’re not on it, it can be tough. Evenyou turn up teams can stop you.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50906886-242x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50906886-501x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50906886-759x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50906886-242x180.jpg 300w ","title":"tele reader delighted with 100 lidl shopping vouchers","story":"A loyal Tele reader was given a nice surprise after she swept up supermarket vouchers worth £.Nicola Saunders, , from Downfield was one of  entrants into the competition where readers enter a unique code printed in the paper for their chance to win the vouchers.Speaking about her win she said: #It#s a nice surprise.

at home to keep up the fight for third spot and Europe.The Dons were trailing - when Hibs were reduced to  men following the dismissal of Steven Whittaker, who was shown a second yellow for a clumsy challenge on Lewis Ferguson.Aberdeen ruthlessly exploited the extra man courtesy of an own goal from Adam Jackson and strikes from Andy Considine and Curtis Main.The fight back denied the Dons suffering a fth straight Premiership home defeat and secured their first league win at Pittodrie since the turn of the year.It was the first home Premiership win since December  last year.With third-placed Motherwell drawing -, Aberdeen also slashed the gap on the Steelmen in the race for Europe to one point.Aberdeen were denied a strong penalty claim soon after falling behind when Lewis Ferguson was felled in the box by Greg Docherty as both players were grappling for the ball.Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes made one change to the starting XI that fought back to draw - away to Kilmarnock on Wednesday.January signing Dylan McGeouch came in for centre-back Mikey Devlin, who dropped to the bench as McInnes set up with three at the back and a five-man midfield.Aberdeen created the opening opportunity in the third minute when Main met a low cross from Niall McGinn  yards out with his back to goal.He was alert enough to attempt a back-heeled flick which passed inches wide of the far post.In the fth minute Jamie Gullan fired in a powerful drive from  yards but keeper Joe Lewis did well to save.A moment later the Easter Road club again threatened when Christian Doidge met a cross from Paul McGinn but Lewis saved well to deny the striker.In an open start to the match Ferguson twice threatened within a minute.First he powered up field from deep in midfield and breaking into the penalty area unleashed a -yard shot that keeper Ofir Marciano blocked.Soon after Ferguson connected with a Connor McLennan cross from the right flank, but his half volley from  yards flew wide.In the th minute Gullan powered through the Dons back-line to open up a shooting opportunity but keeper Lewis  blocked the -yard drive with his feet.Hibs failed to clear a cross from Matty Kennedy in the th minute and the ball fell to McLennan who fired a  yard effort over the bar.Causing problems down the right flank McLennan drilled a low cross towards the far post and Main deftly flicked towards goal from six yards but Marciano was well placed to block.In the th minute Christian DOIDGE was played through a static Dons back-line by a superb pass from Scott Allan.There were calls for offside from the Dons, but the Hibs striker appeared to have timed his run perfectly with an explosion of pace before rounding keeper Lewis and shooting home.Within moments of falling behind Aberdeen had a penalty claim waved aside by referee John Beaton.Midfielder Ferguson was hauled down by Docherty and the Reds were furious a spot kick was not given.Hibs were reduced to  men in the th minute when Whittaker was dismissed when awarded a second yellow following a clumsy challenge on Ferguson.Dons boss McInnes made a change to exploit the extra man when taking off defender Shay Logan for striker Bruce Anderson in the nd minute.Aberdeen equalised in the th minute when McGinn fired a cross in from the left and Adam JACKSON took a wild swipe at the ball when under no real pressure and it went into his net for an own goal.Yet again McGinn was provider in the th minute when his corner kick whipped in wasn#t cleared by the Hibs defence and Andy CONSIDINE stabbed home at the back post from close range.Within three minutes left  Aberdeen had used their width to turn the game around.The Dons made it - in the rd minute following impressive build-up play between Ferguson and McGinn on the right hand side.Northern Ireland international McGinn played a pass to substitute Anderson but his effort was blocked.Striker MAIN capitalised on the loose ball to fire home from eight yards.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Taylor, Considine, Ojo, McGeouch, Ferguson, McLennan, Kennedy, McGinn, Main.Subs: Anderson , Devlin , Hernandez Subs not used: Cerny, Campbell, Bryson, Hedges.HIBS: Marciano, Whittaker, Hanlon, McGinn, Doidge, Boyle, Docherty, Stevenson, Jackson, Allan, Gullan.Subs: Hallberg ,  Omeonga , Horgan ,Subs not used: Bogdan, Gray, McGregor, Murray.Referee: John Beaton"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

We also take a look at what farming is doing to tackle climate change – the issue of the decade.#We were delighted to work alongside NFUS to produce these episodes of OnFARM.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin.

Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too.

Drivers were almost marooned.##Both my son, David, and a family from Greenock arrived at .pm to find it shut. Luckily we managed to get them to open although they were locking up, but surely having a monopoly doesn#t give a business a licence to abuse people.#If it had been half an hour later they would have been stuck, and I#m sure others must have been hit.#People coming from out of town had no way of knowing there would not be anywhere to buy petrol. I am so annoyed about the situation.#Mr Carmichael said: #The closing times over New Year were advertised, but even on Tuesday when we were supposed to close at pm we decided to stay open as there were unfamiliar faces about. We stayed open until those who would have been leaving had filled up.#If someone does get caught out, most people know that they can contact the police station, and they can get in touch with garage staff members to help them out.#FIFTY YEARS AGOStudents hit out at Kintyre hoteliersHoteliers in Kintyre are apathetic, according to the Scottish Hotel School students who recently conducted a survey in Kintyre.The students working on the project claim that hoteliers were apathetic and were often reluctant to answer questions.In charge of the work was Dr David Pattison who is a lecturer at the Scottish Hotel School.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC. Kick-off is pm with Kintyre Park the expected venue.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Edinburgh University, astonishingly, failed to support her.The gay tennis icon Martina Navratilova was expelled from the LGBT group, Athlete Ally, for saying that people with male physiques should not complete in womenrsquos sport.Cultural and health bodies, and even the Scottish Government, were ceasing to use the very word ldquowoman in case it offended male-bodied transwomen. Bizarre substitutes like ldquowomxn, ldquomenstruators and ldquociswomen were being deployed in the cause of inclusivity.Well, times change. This issue is now out in the open. More and more women are speaking out against the undermining of sex-based rights.Even the ultra-wokeis permitting columns from feminists like Suzanne Moore calling for an end to the ldquono ing of gender-critical academics like Professor Selina Todd and Dr Kathleen Stock. They have been labelled as ldquoTerfs by trans zealots.Last week, the UK Government called a halt to self-identication legislation south of the Border. Ministers discovered that children as young as  are being given puberty blockers by gender reassignment clinics. Puberty blockers halt the sexual development of children. They are of the class of drugs once used as chemical castration for sex offenders.Influential figures in the SNP, like the former communications guru, Kevin Pringle, are now urging Nicola Sturgeon to follow the UK Government. But the Scottish Equalities Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, apparently intends to press ahead with legislation to allow self-ID. Mr Pringle is speaking for many in the party who now realise that the growing backlash against Self-ID could threaten the SNPrsquos chances in next yearrsquos Holyrood elections.Yet it seemed glaringly obvious to me two years ago that women would never accept this existential assault on their sexual identity. How could they be expected to accept people with male genitalia and masculine physiques as real women  Why should women be forced to accept male-bodied transwomen in their protected spaces, in changing rooms and toilets Indeed, at first I thought this proposition that transwomen were literally women was just anti-trans scaremongering. Surely activists werenrsquot actually saying that they were biologically female I learned the hard way that this is precisely what they were saying. I was repeatedly accused of hate speech for suggesting that this would mean the removal of human biology from the school curriculum.Political leaders like Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson continue to insist that people with penises can be and are actually female. Labourrsquos Shadow Equalities Secretary, Dawn Butler, said last month that ldquobabies are born without a sex. This is pure flat earthism.Shamefully, leading feminists like Germaine Greer have been ldquocancelled for objecting to extreme transgenderism as misogyny. That it demeans and invalidates women.How could someone with a male body possibly experience social reality in the way real women do  Transwomen do not have uteruses, do not menstruate, do not give birth.Trans advocates reply that, well, some women canrsquot give birth and some women donrsquot menstruate. This is ridiculous and offensive sophistry. Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does.

The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels. The past might well be a foreign country, as L P Hartley wrote, but some areas seem to attract package holiday tours, leaving tumbleweed to roll through the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-pandemic-clear-bed-blocking-people-taken-system","story":"Professor June Andrews recognised hercomments were ldquohorric but gave an honest assessmentof the potential consequences of a large-scale coronavirus outbreak.Prof Andrews is a former director of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Centre for Change and Innovation.

Amongst his many wilful misinterpretations, his reference to ldquohellipattempts to break up Canadarsquos -year-old unionhellip is particularly revealing. The UK is a union Canada is a Confederation. Canadians routinely refer to their ldquofederal government. The federal nature of its governance is what has kept this geographically, linguistically and culturally erse country together.The two referendums on Quebec independence reinforced this federalism and changed the whole country. And even that may not be enough to save the confederation, whose fate still hangs in the balance. By contrast, there is not, and never has been, anything remotely federal about UK governance.

outdoor stones so with all these changing weather patterns it may be a while before the new owners can get the opportunity to use them.Curling is said to date back to the th century, and was first played on frozen ponds and lochs in Scotland using flat stones taken from riverbeds.Known as the roaring game for the noise the stones make as they travel across the ice, the oldest stone dates from

As far as I can tell, itrsquos all the fault of George Formby.Think about it, Gormless George was glorying criminal behaviour long before hip hop happened. According to UK law, voyeurism is the illegal viewing or recording of another person while they conduct private activities. Did such an edict concern our George  Not much, it didnrsquot. In his song When Irsquom Cleaning Windows, which he first belted out in one of his popular movies, Formby boasted about the amount of sneaky peeking he enjoyed while he was meant to be innocently plying his trade.On the tunersquos release, the BBC was as disgusted as any newspaper columnist spotting a bottle of tonic wine in the hand of a West Lothian crooner. The head of the corporation at the time, Lord Reith, sputtered: ldquoIf the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, theyll have to be content to hear it in the cinemas, not over the nations airwaves. As he was born and raised in Glasgow, Lord Reith surely must have been an expert on disgusting little ditties, so should have been obeyed by the great unwashed. But the public chose to ignore him instead, and Formbyrsquos song become one of the biggest hits of the s.Which proves that the public loves a bad boy. Eventhe bad boy plays a ukulele.

Though only because Irsquom assuming Lewis has a bunch of snappy, scrappy dogs roaming his grounds, protecting him and his privacy. And those snappy, scrappy dogs are probably tanked up on the Bucky, just like their sweetly-crooning master.Since an invasion of Capaldirsquos privacy isnrsquot on the cards, I instead find myself, late of an evening, in Glasgowrsquos south side.

Some of them sing and dance others just cavort without musical accompaniment.The reason for all this vibrant voyeurism  Irsquom at Strathbungo Window Wanderland, a curious event, now in its fourth year, where locals decorate their windows in a lavish and sometimes surreal fashion.Why  For the entertainment of anyone who happens to be sauntering past, of course. Though most of the people on the streets tonight arenrsquot random rubberneckers. Like myself they arrived quite deliberately. Wersquore all loitering with intent here to experience a very unusual evening.Advent calendarSome of the windows I stroll past are decorated with simple designs. One homeowner has painted a barcode across glass. There are also pop culture references galore. I spot the silhouette of Yoda from Star Wars, and a Harry Potter themed house.A few images are political, and therefore tedious. A window is a transparent sheet of glass, after all, that allows light to shine through. Such glass should never be dulled by the dreary smear of dogma.The houses are backlit by interior lighting, making theof each street look like a glowing advent calendar.

Immigrant communities and those fleeing terror from brutal regimes are already accustomed to being regarded as virulent. We round them up isolate and detain them and then pack them off to their country of origin using some minor refraction real or imagined.Those we give leave to remain must first be doused in the healing waters of a UK history exam which conveniently omits to mention any of those gnarly deeds of empire which caused them ultimately to seek peace here. We havenrsquot yet got round to forcing them to wear bells around their necks and shout ldquoUnclean! Unclean! but the Toriesrsquo Windrush project was a close approximation.We ascribe to them, in the manner of a pandemic, all sorts of anti-social behaviours and deploy our Conservative-leaning newspapers to de-humanise them and portray them as a danger to the British way of le. Only after we consider them safe and have absorbed them safely into the UK bloodstream do we permit a limited number ndash at a distance ndash to share in this nationrsquos bounty, much of which is built on what we looted from their countries in the first place.The instinct towards the survival of the fittest, which lies at the heart of Tory doctrine, comes to the fore when a global pandemic begins to rattle. In , the prestigious US think-tank Brookings studied how poor countries and disadvantaged communities suffer disproportionately when pandemics roar. ldquoRegardless of where a pandemic starts, once underway, the poor tend to bear the brunt. Low and middle-income countries have weaker health systems and limited capacity to handle surges in cases.The essay went on: ldquoWe can curtail pandemicswe quickly develop vaccines and make them widely accessible. However, without vigorous efforts to secure equitable access, vaccine distribution will follow the logic of the market. During the  swine flu pandemic, wealthy countries secured large advance orders for vaccines, but, despite the efforts of the World Health Organisation to negotiate donations, poor countries were crowded out ndash receiving vaccines more slowly than rich countries and unable to cover as many of their citizens.At its most primitive level this tendency is evident in bulk-buying at supermarkets or filling up at petrol stations during an energy shortage.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Following discussions with the OIC Economic Development department, we decided to hold the seminar and networking event just after the Business Festival to give an informative seminar for local businesses who are interested in the global market.“Mr Yukita will talk about Japan and UK relations, the Japanese economy, structural reform, business opportunities and tips for doing business with Japan.“We also invited local businessmen Stephen Kemp, who recently went to Japan to explore the Japanese market, and Gareth Davies, from Aquatera, to be guest speakers and ists. They will present information on the potential and the reality of conducting business globally.”Harvey Johnston, who is a patron of the OJA largely due to family connections with the country, will chair the event while Liam McArthur will be attending the seminar as Chairman of OJA. Mr Johnston said: “We should take the opportunity to encourage trade and links on a broader scale on a post-Brexit world.”Claire Kemp from Orkney Business Gateway added: “It’s great that there’s a real theme to the ‘business week’ with so much free support, advice and information being made available from such highly-respected and informative people.“It’s fantastic that there will be easyaccess to knowledge and experience for local businesses to take advantage of. We’re aware that time is precious and scarce for business owners, but hopefully there’s something during this week that’s worth investing their time in – butthey can’t, it’s reassuring to know that local support from the likes of Business Gateway and OJA is always available.”For more information, you can contact OJAinfo@btinternetcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 27 ","story":"With the Six Nations Rugby Championship now three-fths of the way through, only France remain unbeaten.Scotland’s victory over Italy in Rome on Saturday was deserved, and enough to avoid the ignominy of the wooden spoon.As a spectacle the match will not live long in the memory, save for captain Stuart Hogg scoring the kind of try that only a few in the world can produce.Hogg’s display overall was very good, both defensively and from an attacking point of view. From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately.

Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door. Tickets are available from the Devenish reception or by contacting Danielmcginley@gmail.Alanna’s Hidden Hope will be available on iTunes, single priced at £..Proceeds raised on the night will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group and PIPS Charity.

This will obviously be kept under constant review.As has previously been stated, there will not be a sharp transition between containment and delay phases. Many of the actions taken during containment will still continue in any delay phase. Responses may y between dferent regions, depending on the circumstances.It comes as five new cases were identied last night in the Republic of Ireland bringing to  the number of confirmed cases in the country.The National Public Health Emergency Team announced the new cases.Among them is a female healthcare worker in the south of Ireland and her case is associated with a close contact with a confirmed case, the National Public Health Emergency Team announced. The other four cases are a male in the east of Ireland and a woman in the south whose cases are associated with travel from northern Italy a female in the west of Ireland whose case is associated with close contact with a confirmed case and a male in the south of the country whose case is associated with travel.Liam Woods, HSE director of acute operations, said: Healthcare workers are at the frontline of this virus outbreak. The Department of Health and the HSE are equally dedicated to protecting and supporting this vital group of people.Dr Ronan Glynn, Ireland#s deputy chief medical officer, said: The past number of weeks have been challenging for everyone in our healthcare system. This challenge is going escalate as the number of cases here rise.We must prioritise the protection of our frontline healthcare staff and as part of this the National Public Health Emergency Team has established a sub-group to identy and implement appropriate measures to protect them.More than  have now tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, in the largest day-on-day increase. In total,  people had tested positive for Covid- as of am on Friday, up from  cases reported at the same time on Thursday.On Thursday evening another patient, reported to be a woman in her s, became the first person in the UK to die after being diagnosed with Covid- while at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. Last night, a man in his early s with underlying health issues became the second to die in the UK.Meanwhile, St Patrick#s Day events across Northern Ireland are still scheduled to go ahead as planned despite fears over the spread of the coronavirus.At present Belfast City Council has no plans to cancel its annual St Patrick Day celebrations Belfast City Council spokesperosnOrganisers of the biggest event in Belfast and another major gathering in Armagh say that while they are watching the situation closely, there are currently no plans to call off the traditional March  celebrations.At present Belfast City Council has no plans to cancel its annual St Patrick Day celebrations, a Belfast City Council spokesperson said.We will continue to follow public health advice and will act in accordance with any advice received.Thousands of people from all around the world are expected to attend the city centre celebrations. An independently organised parade in Armagh is also scheduled to take place.Chairman of the city#s St Patrick#s Day Celebrations Committee, Stephen Fields said: It is expected to be a bigger and more colourful event than last year.Organisers are keeping a close eye on any possible developments in the coronavirus issue but as it stands currently the parade is still going ahead as planned. If public health officials# advice was to change we would certainly take this on board.The first two parade cancellations in Ireland were announced on Friday, with events in Cork called off due to public health concerns.But Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said yesterday that mass public gatherings such as St Patrick#s Day parades will not be cancelled amid the spread of Covid-.Speaking following a stakeholder meeting with health officials yesterday, he said: We are not recommending at this stage that any major events be cancelled but this of course will be kept under review.I think the risk is too big to go ahead and I think it#s time to make a hard decision Professor Kingston MillsThat was despite a warning from a top scientist at trinity College#s School of Biochemistry and Immunology.Professor Kingston Mills said: It#s still at the very early stages so I don#t think we need the measures that were required in China, but we do need to be a little more stringent.St Patrick#s Day, personally, I don#t think they should go ahead.I think that#s a mass gathering that involved a lot of people that will have come from outside Ireland. I think the risk is too big to go ahead and I think it#s time to make a hard decision.It came after more than  staff at Cork University Hospital were asked to self-isolate following the identication of a case of community transmission of the virus at the site.

We brought together the entire scientic team, mobilised as soon as we became aware and then got active, said Prof Duprex.Other teams are working on developing drugs, but vaccines are our game, said the scientist, who graduated from Queen#s University, Belfast, with a joint degree in biochemistry and genetics. He gained his PhD in virology and lectured for  years at the university before moving to the US.Moderna, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company, announced yesterday that it plans to begin human trials on a potential vaccine it is developing using RNA coding.It means there is a vaccine candidate, a step forward, the vaccine research director said, but cautioned that mass doses of a vaccine likely will not be available for a year or more.Prof Duprex said Pittsburgh was chosen as one of the centres to be picked to begin work quickly because of its long history working with viruses. The university is also internationally renowned as the professional home of Jonas Salk, the creator of the polio vaccine.We have a high security containment laboratory where we are able to work with pathogens safely, he said, adding that the centre staff has worked on other high profile viruses, including SARS and MERS.The scientist explained his team first developed cells on which the virus could be grown into millions of particles. Animal-based models to carry out deep lung tests are then produced. While historically the development of vaccines was slow - sometimes taking years as in the case of polio - times have changed with a iety of dferent ways to generate them, the former Lurgan College student said.In the case of the coronavirus, the National Institutes of Healthand the Food and Drug Administration , the regulatory bodies charged with policing trials and reviewing drugs and vaccines, have indicated they will speed up the review process.But Prof Duprex noted that it takes six months for a normal flu vaccine to be developed, tested, reviewed and be available in sufficient amounts to meet demand.We have to be realistic because when you say a vaccine is in development people have to understand what that actually means. It is potentially months, a year, more than a year, probably.The university staff are actively working with other scientists across the globe and co-coordinating with the World Health Organisation .No one#s ego is more important than the public health and we need to be collaborative, Prof Duprex said. There is a sharing of data which is not typical within the world wide scientic community, but it is critical that we are good partners.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A security source said police officers have been standing guard at the station since early February.The Belfasthas chosen not to identy the location of the station but has observed officers carrying out foot patrols in its vicinity.Officers have also been placed at the station#s main entrances as a precaution.The source revealed that the PSNI fears the possible attack may occur during the daytime in an attempt by dissidents to catch officers off-guard.The source went into detail on how the security services believe the attack would most likely be airborne, and probably an improvised mortar device.The PSNI has declined to respond, stating it does comment on operational matters.The latest incident carried out by dissidents took place last December when a suspected grenade was thrown at a police car in west Belfast.It follows a -month period of increasing activity from dissidents. Last September a bomb - described as being in the advanced state of readiness - was made safe by ammunition technical officers after it was found in the Creggan area of Londonderry.A similar attack took place two days earlier which resulted in the PSNI making safe a mortar bomb that had been left close to a police station in Strabane.Last August dissidents used a hoax device to lure police officers and soldiers to a remote rural location at Wattlebridge near the border in Co Fermanagh and then exploded the real bomb.Chief Constable Simon Byrne later laid the blame on Continuity IRA terrorists for the potentially lethal incident.The previous month dissidents tried to murder police officers during an attack in Craigavon, Co Armagh, with a device discovered on Tullygally Road.In July  the New IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb placed under a police officer#s car at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast.The PSNI later released a statement which placed the blame on violent dissident republicans.The latest PSNI security bulletin has revealed there has been an increase in the number of shooting incidents, bombing incidents and paramilitary-style attacks between March  and last month.It also recorded one security-related death - the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, who was killed by a bullet fired by dissidents during rioting in the Creggan in Derry.Also in March dissidents posted five explosive devices posted to locations across the UK, including one sent to Glasgow UniversityMark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, said yesterday that while he would not comment on the police station threat, any attempt by dissidents to launch an attack is to be roundly condemned. We need an all-out effort by society to isolate such extremism and help the PSNI bring these people before the courts, he said.

It was great to hear everybody singing from the same hymn sheet.“World Down’s Syndrome Day is celebrated each year. It was designated by the United Nationsin  and it recognises Down’s Syndrome and everything that goes with it.“I wanted the council to light up the building in the colours that are associated with World Down’s Syndrome Day – blue and yellow – to recognise the role people with Down’s Syndrome, their carers, parents and families play in our community.”Cllr McMullan is hopeful the momentum can be used to help the council create a work placement programme for young people with Down’s Syndrome.Work experience“Most importantly, I’ve asked the council now to look at all its departments, community centres etc and seewe can open up a work placement scheme to bring young men and women and give them work experience that they wouldn’t normally get, he said.“I’ve also asked the council to write to the other ten councils and ask them to support my motion and hopefully they’ll do the same thing. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

However, Derry Now visited the outlet this afternoon and a team of workers were removing the fixtures and fittings from the building. One of the workers confirmed that the outlet has closed. The closure of the Boojum outlet, which only opened at the start of last year, will be another blow to the economy of the Strand Road area. Last year, the Primrose cafe, which was only a few doors up from Boojum, also closed.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since launching in Belfast in , Co-Founders has delivered four cohorts involving  people who formed more than  teams - over  of whom are still working together. Twenty teams have received Proof of Concept funding, and eight teams have progressed to the full-time Propel pre-accelerator programme.Co-Founders has attracted software engineers, data scientists, sales and marketing experts, medical professionals, mechanical engineers, researchers, undergraduates and PhDs as well as people who have experienced a problem in a certain industry or from everyday le and want to develop a product to solve it.Participants in the new North West programme will have the added incentive of being in the running to win one of five pound, proof of concept grants from Innovate UK, the government’s innovation agency, which will be awarded to five teams with the best developed ideas at the end of the programme.Sonya Kerr, programme manager of Co-Founders, said Catalyst was hoping to attract  to  people from Derry, Letterkenny and across the North West to sign up.“We know there is a wealth of talent in the North West and a lot of people who have great ideas or are restless to try something new, who will really benefit from meeting others with dferent skills needed to build a start-up that they wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet,” she said.“Teams on Co-Founders are willing to try something dferent, meet new people and stretch themselves. We certainly don’t expect everyone to leave their jobs immediately and create a start-up but by helping people validate their ideas and build teams, it becomes a real option for many.”For example, of the nine teams who completed Catalyst’s first Co-Founders programme, three are still together and two have received over pound, in funding to build and launch their products.While on the programme, Co-Founder teams get access to co-working space within Catalyst to allow them to grow their own networks.Applications are now open for the programme at:wearecatalyst.org programmes co-founders The deadline for applications for the North West programme is this Wednesday, March . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

First up saw Declan Gallagher take on Danny McDaid in a best of  singles match and with some high scoring and clinical finishing from McDaid, Maileys went one up. That scoreline was doubled when last years pairs champs Clancy and Wilson were drawn to play against Shaun O Hagan and Eddie McDermot in what can only be described as an epic match with loads of tons plus scores and some delightful finishes. Clancy and Wilson took this match and put Maileys in control.In the trebles match Hegarty and Gallagher saw off the efforts off Gill, Gallagher and Maginnis to complete the whitewash and send Maileys through to the showpiece.The nd semi final saw Laurences A defeat the hosts Georges a by - to reach the final. There was no sheet ed for match report so onto the final itself.Maileys faced Laurences and what a cracker of a game this was. First up for Maileys was last years singles champ Sean Wilson against Glen Temple and only for a few wasted darts from Temple this match could have been an upset but Wilsons vast experience just about shone thru to edge victory from the jaws of defeat to put Maileys  up in their quest for silverware.

Laurences moved ahead in the very next game with the trio off O Kane, Ramsey and ONeill taking advantage of some bad darts from the Maileys trio off Gallagher, Hegarty and Clancy to put Laurences on the brink of victory. With the match finely poised, the next match was a pivotal moment for Pearson as victory over McCallion would see Laurences run out - but McCallion had other ideals and duly dispatched Pearson  nil to set up the captains pick match decider, which was to be Hegarty vs ONeill in a best of  shootout to determine this years winner.Both players were very nervy in this match. In the first leg Hegarty missed darts at doubles to go one up with ONeill grinding away and taking his chance to go one up.The match was finely poised and victory in the nd leg for ONeill would have given Laurences victory but Hegarty showed determination and grit and hit a double  to set up a last leg decider.The last leg decider saw both players get off to a great start but it was ONeill who got to the double first.  match darts were missed by ONeill and  by Hegarty and saw this game and match end up very nervy double  from Hegarty to send the Maileys team into delirium as he won the match and cup for the nd year in row over the unlucky Laurences bar.The Committee would like to thank Sean Mc Laughlin and Georges bar for their continued support sponsorship of the cup and facilities on the night. googletag.cmd.push Back to league action this week with followings games down to be played Friday, th March.Maileys vs fairviewPhoenix vs laurences Mary bs vs Georges a Georges b vs laurences b The league Committee would like to congratulate Phoenix player Paddy Maginnis for his exploits in helping team Northern Ireland secure the Celtic Cup last weekend and also to Maileys player and Donegal captain Sean Wilson on the recent success at the all Ireland championships and becoming champions.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

Speaking to the East Belfast Herald newspaper at his Cregagh home in , he said he was unsurethe call-up could be legally enforced, but decided to enlist in case he would be subsequently directed to serve with the Navy. What happened next took the Belfast bakery worker on an epic journey through France and into southern Germany via the Haardt Mountains and Hitler’s ‘eagle’s nest’ mountain base at Berchtesgaden.As the war drew to a close in , Teddy’s unit was involved in the capture of Hitler’s deputy – Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering – in Austria, and it was the newly-promoted Sergeant Dixon who dispatched to check out reports of a salt mine filled with priceless artworks, and then tasked with guarding the treasures at Salzburg Castle.Members of Teddy’s family have travelled thousands of miles to be with him this weekend for a busy round of birthday celebrations, including a family lunch in the local church hall on Saturday and a hotel buffet event in his honour on Sunday evening.US Army veteran Teddy Dixon got the VIP treatment at Movie House Dublin Road in  when he came in to watch The Monuments Men starring George Clooney and Matt Damon. Picture: John Murphy Aurora PAThe much-loved centenarian is in good spirits and will be reliving some of the many highlights of his amazing le surrounded by family and friends, but the shock of discovering thousands of Holocaust victims in  has never left him. The dead had been packed into train carriages as the Nazis attempted to move the evidence of war crimes further away from the advancing Allies. “I was one of the first  soldiers to enter the gates of Dachau camp on April  and can still see the bodies in my mind’s eye,” Teddy recalled in .“The dead were lying everywhere and the smell was indescribable. We found one man who had been left for dead in a carriage but was still alive and we got him some medical attention. We gave our rations to as many of those who could eat but it was too late for several who died in front of our eyes.“It was like going into Hell.”Teddy Dixon at home in East Belfast ahead of his th birthday on May . Photo: Laura Davison Pacemaker PressSpeaking to the News Letter in , he said the vivid memories would never leave him, but he continued to carry out speaking engagements to raise awareness of the warning from history.“I still like doing the talks in schools but it can annoy you a bit sometimes when you think about it. Many a time when I wake up I find I’ve been dreaming about the Holocaust,” he added.But thankfully Teddy can recall many happier times during his eventful  years – including countless honours and awards from Holocaust survivors, the US Government and Belfast City Council,His wartime memories include partying on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on the first Bastille Day after liberation from the Germans in July .Teddy Dixon aged  in his US Army unormThe le-long member or Orange lodge LOL in Sandy Row had been granted leave from tracking down war criminals in Austria and was on his way home for the Twelfth – but got stranded in the French capital due to the decimation of the rail infrastructure.In more recent times, the Big Lottery Fund paid for Teddy to travel back to Dachau to commemorate the th anniversary of the liberation. • With Teddy Dixon’s war record reading like the plot of a Hollywood film, it was no surprise that George Clooney brought one of the Belfast man’s adventures to le in a blockbuster movie.The Monuments Men, released in , was based on the story of theNazis’ looted art treasures Teddy helped recover from an Austrian salt mine. Each one of thousands of priceless artworks – including Michelangelo’s ‘Madonna of Bruges’ sculpture and Vermeer’s painting ‘The Astronomer’ – had been packed on to several train carriages and hidden in the mine close to Altaussee. At the film’s launch, the then -year-old Teddy was a Movie House cinema guest for a special screening in Belfast. He told the News Letter afterwards: “I enjoyed it.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

Victims are regularly kept updated on progress of investigations.ldquoWe are dedicated to making our communities even safer by preventing and reducing crime and building on our success in solving crime and seeking justice for victims.ldquoCompared to similar forces in the UK, South Wales Police is the best performing force on recorded crime and there is a  per cent lower chance of being a victim of crime in South Wales than where.ldquoThere was a  per cent year-on-year reduction in burglaries in the Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan area, where people are far less likely to become a victim of burglary than where in South Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
