Henri Kisielewski is the 2019 recipient of the Joan Wakelin bursary, administrated in partnership with the Royal Photographic SocietyFado is Lisbon’s urban folk music, born in and around the brothels, alleyways and ​tascas ​of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods. Fado is to Lisbon what the Blues are to the Delta. Written records trace it back to the early 19th century, though some argue it is much older, connecting it to oral traditions imported from across the Portuguese empire.At the heart of fado is ​saudade.​ This elusive word – apparently untranslatable from the original Portuguese – broadly refers to a sense of sorrow, of yearning, and a resigned desire for what once was. This is the underlying emotion of all fado and perhaps of Lisbon itself.Alfama is Lisbon’s oldest surviving neighbourhood: a maze of medieval and moorish architectures arranged in a patchwork of steep cobbled alleyways and red-clay roofs, rising up from the Tagus river. Once a close-knit fishing community, it is now the heart of Lisbon’s tourist industry.A decade ago, struggling to recover from a deep recession, Portugal’s government turned to tourism and opened the real-estate market to foreign speculation. Today, more then half of all accommodation in Alfama is destined for tourism and thousands of long-standing residents have been priced out of the city centre. One after another, the shops that catered to the local community closed to make way for tourist-facing businesses – many of which are “fado restaurants” – and now Alfama feels more like a theme park than a living neighbourhood. This touristification is affecting much of the city​.​ If things keep going the way they are, one journalist wrote in 2016, Lisbon will soon have to hire extras to play Portuguese people in its streets.In 2019, I spent a month in Lisbon exploring the complicated relationship between fado and tourism. On one hand, fado is often upheld as the essence of Lisbon, an incorruptible mainstay in a rapidly changing city. On the other, it is the main attraction for many of the city’s 4.5 million visitors and is increasingly commodified to meet this demand.A recurring feature in many fados is Lisbon itself, in particular what it used to be. In its long history, many forces have played a hand in altering the city and its social fabric, the destructive 1755 earthquake being a key example. Today’s aggressive touristification is another seismic event, the full impact of which is yet to be fully understood.In many cases, the allusions within fado’s poems refer to both a real and an imagined history, both a concrete remembrance and an imprecise, idealised version of the way things were. In fado, truth and fiction coexist, history and myth are tangled.There is a parallel between this ambiguous relationship to the city, past and present, and the experience of modern tourism. In ​Invisible Cities,​ Italo Calvino describes travellers visiting the fictional metropolis of Maurilia. They are invited to accompany their experience of the present with the help of old postcards that depict how Maurilia once was, the “postcard city” being key to appreciating the city as it now stands.Travellers​ arrive in a location hoping that it will live up to what they had imagined, and are quicker to see the postcard city than the place itself. Over time, the place changes to fit this imagined expectation. It’s paradoxical, wrote the mayor of Barcelona in 2014, but uncontrolled mass tourism ends up destroying the very things that made a city attractive to visitors in the first place.This is particularly obvious in Lisbon, where the sheer speed of change and lack of oversight have magnified the problem. Once the locals have left, once all the menus are in English and, when looking down the ancient, winding alleyways to the waterfront, one is more likely to see the hulking mass of a cruise ship than the water of the Tagus river, what remains is a longing for what has been lost – whether real or imagined. What remains is saudade​.In an anonymous back street, far from the tourist gaze, there is one establishment like no other: a small fado house in a former Italian restaurant where fadistas meet once their tourist-facing engagements are done with. It’s an institution in Lisbon’s underground scene, open from midnight to 6am, and not featured in any guidebooks. I have been asked not to name it for fear that a surge in popularity might affect its delicate ecosystem.Inside, old fado legends glance out from yellowed posters in crooked frames and black funereal shawls – traditionally worn by female fadistas – hang proudly among them like team scarves in a football clubhouse. Thick red curtains cover the windows and the blue formica floor tiles have turned a minty green from decades of bleach and wine.This is the home of​ fadovadio,​ where amateurs and professionals take turns interpreting the canon. It is not uncommon to see a performance by a taxi driver followed by a well-known fadista, and then a butcher’s wife. One regular performer is a respected professor of Medieval bureaucracy.Any mention of this place elicits amused disdain from the owners and staff of the more “respectable” fado houses f​adovadio ​is not serious, they will say.​ ​But it is known to them all and they, too, can be spotted here on occasion, drinking from the source.Manuelo is the master of ceremonies, a prickly and charismatic octogenarian who made a name for himself in fado circles in the mid-60s. Donna Lena, his Russian wife, is a striking blond of ferocious energy. She spends each night serving drinks, making food and tending to the guests’ every need. Donna Lena and her husband are the adoptive parents of Lisbon’s fado community. The story goes that she ran away from the Soviet ballet to marry him when on tour in Portugal. But, here too, myth and history are tangled.At 2am, the performances are about to begin and the air is thick with smoke and anticipation. Beyond the laughter and chatting, one can make out the gentle cacophony of string instruments being tuned.During each set, the fadista performs four or five pieces. Lulled by wine and the red-tinged darkness, the audience is gradually swept up by the music, taken on a hazy voyage that evokes homesick sailors, despairing lovers and death. Some rest their heads in their hands, others stare wistfully into space. There is always at least one person who closes their eyes and falls into a deep sleep.One Saturday, around 5am, Marta Rosa appeared at the door with her small entourage. We had been introduced early in my stay and she proved invaluable in helping me navigate the intricacies of Lisbon fado.Donna Lena was tallying up the night’s damage for a customer with wine-stained lips. An old woman was handing Manuelo a framed picture of herself for the wall.Aside from the table of white-haired men arguing over a card game, the fadistas had the place to themselves. Marta joined the others in the back an L-shaped section of the room that is the domain of the performers.Five or six musicians and a handful of singers were sitting around the wonky tables that had, over the years, been demoted from the main room. By pivoting my chair I was now on the fringes of this new circle. I remember thinking it was a fitting place for me: neither a fadista nor a guest an interloper of sorts, a tourist who looks down on other tourists.There was a loud dissonant jumble, like a music lesson before the teacher arrives. Marta removed her coat and stood with her chin raised, her hands clasped tight in front of her. Then someone played the opening melody of Amália Rodrigues’ Ai Mouraria,​ and the cacophony fell silent. Donna Lena switched off the lights and accompaniment soon came from two sides as Marta began to sing.Her voice was soft to begin with. She floated through the high notes with a plaintive vibrato, squeezing emotion out of every drooping cadence. Then her song grew more forceful. By the end, it filled the whole room as she raised her chin higher, revealing the taught muscles in her neck.Almost as soon as the piece was over, amidst a few friendly heckles, a new one took off on another table. Poems succeeded each other in this frenzy into the early morning with different permutations, styles and rhythms, each singer owning the room in their own way. Occasionally, during a song, the words ​“O Fado” escaped someone’s mouth like a libation, in a voice both hushed and loud. This, I came to learn, was the signal that fado was happening.​Ricardo Ribeiro, one of the icons of modern fado, had explained it to me as a “manifestation”, a moment when everything comes together and all present share a sort of metaphysical communion. When the instruments disappear to leave only music, he had said, and the words disappear to leave only feeling, that is fado.On my last night in Lisbon, I walked down towards the centre of Alfama. I passed a wall near a shuttered restaurant where the words “Locals Welcome” had been thinly painted over and new grafitti had appeared: “Welcome Locals”.During my stay, I saw fado in cramped apartments and concert halls, street corners, ballrooms and sticky-floored taverns where tourists queued at the door. I visited evening classes in a suburb of tower blocks where a new sense of community has formed around fado. I attended a fundraising concert for a disabled girl where fado was the order of the day.The roots of fado run deep in Lisbon and that doesn’t seem likely to change. More than once I heard of the three F’s that make up the Portuguese spirit: Fado, Futebol, Fátima.Just as it survived the censorship and co-opting of the Salazar regime, fado’s essence will likely survive the effects of mass tourism. In fact, singing a more predictable version to tourists allows the majority of fadistas to live from their craft and in turn, allows “real” fado to survive.Trying to make sense of it all, I kept coming back to what Ricardo Ribeiro had said. He wasn’t interested in the distinction between “real” fado or tourist fado, commodification or authenticity only that once in a while, wherever it might be, fado h​appened.​Beside the church of Sao Miguel, the terraces of three restaurants share a sloping square around an old palm tree. In a doorway, a large woman was singing an epic fado about desire, loss and revenge, but her heart wasn’t in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f960f07252f1852557a32859890ee891a502e4ae/0_209_4840_2906/master/4840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e0d07da5b06e8f4c95c0a840067cee3","title":"appledore book festival shifts gears first drive in book event coronavirus devon","story":"Rethought for the pandemic, this year’s Appledore book festival in Devon will play to audiences in cars, who can flash their lights and listen via radioBooklovers at the Appledore book festival this September will not be able to subject their favourite authors to the usual detailed questioning after a reading. Instead, the north Devon event is setting out to become the UK’s first ever drive-in book festival, where audience members will need to submit questions in advance, and flash their car lights to alert writers to their presence.The Appledore book festival has been running annually since 2006, but organisers said that after months of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, it became clear that this year’s event would not be able to go ahead if social distancing was still in place. Many of the UK’s book festivals, from Hay to Wigtown, have gone online-only in the wake of the pandemic, but the Appledore team came up with the idea of a drive-in festival, to be held in the grounds of the local Skern Lodge outdoor activity centre.Authors and interviewers will sit, socially distanced, on stage and more than 100 cars will be able to attend each event, listening to interviews through a dedicated in-car FM radio station, or via the PA system. Food and drink will be available to order in advance, served directly to the car once parked, and as guests leave, there will be a drive-through book stall selling signed copies.“We’ve hung on and we’ve kept our fingers crossed, but it became very apparent in the last few weeks that we couldn’t book our usual venues, and people were obviously concerned about any social distancing that might take place,” said festival director Ann Juby. “So we came up with the idea of a drive-in. We were reading about cinema going that way, and comedy festivals. We made some investigations, and it’s on – full steam ahead. People are going to feel safe because they will stay in their cars.”The five-day festival, which kicks off on 18 September, is set to welcome writers including former children’s laureate and War Horse author Michael Morpurgo, bestselling novelist Adele Parks, television presenter Kate Humble, former British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch, and broadcaster and author Jeremy Vine.Guests will be able to send in questions in advance for authors to answer during their events, said Juby. “We’ll also have a mic at a distance, so people can wind their windows down to ask a question, and if we pull out a question sent in before the event, we’ll ask the person who sent it in to flash their car lights so the author can engage. We’re trying to make it as interactive as possible, and luckily we’re in a field so at the end we can have applause and honking of horns and flashing of lights, to make it exciting.”The festival is a registered charity, and profits support a local schools literacy programme. Vine, the festival’s patron, said: “Lockdown has been so hard for everyone but we honestly believe that, as things ease, people will be more desperate than ever for their annual fix of literature by the sea. If there’s ever been a drive-in book festival before, I’ve yet to hear of it. I hope we have a festival like no other, and show the horrible coronavirus that you can’t keep our great writers down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8cb7146dc0ee452fd4869ddda983a354f32c73/0_146_4392_2635/master/4392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb68b888e2da24df9c96ab8c5594bd96","title":"flew jumbo jet 10 years 747 ba pilot aircraft concorde","story":"Former BA captain says aircraft that captivated passengers and pilots alike will be missed more than ConcordeWhat was it like to fly a jumbo?It wasn’t until I completed my first external inspection of a 747 that I realised just how big it is. I knew the 747-400, which I was just about to fly for the first time in the early 2000s, was bigger than my previous aircraft, but just how big was a real surprise. Four engines, 16 massive main wheels, four engines and two passenger decks. It was on a different scale.The size translates into significant differences in how it is flown, too. Taxiing it around an airport is an exercise in geometry, as you take the flight deck beyond the edge of the taxiway, because you are sat so far ahead of the nosewheel – the set of wheels furthest forward in the plane. When airborne, the size translates into significantly more momentum: it remains the fastest flying commercial jet. For a pilot, that represents a challenge. You have to anticipate every manoeuvre you are going to make on a 747 – more than on previous aircraft types I have flown – because its size and momentum mean it is less forgiving.Unlike a fly-by-wire aircraft like the Airbus family – where a computer system interacts with the pilot – the jumbo needed positively flying, or rather a more hands-on style. If you didn’t keep it flying in the direction you wanted, it could very quickly get away from you and, given its large momentum, was more difficult to correct. It was more a pilot’s aircraft for that reason.There are other challenges, too: with up to 350 passengers and 20 crew aboard for up to 14 hours, the legal authority and responsibility for the safety, security and “maintenance of good order” on board threw up regular and interesting questions. Because of the amount of time we spend airborne and the relaxed feel brought about by the space available inside, you often get drinkers getting drunker, lovers becoming more amorous and children getting very bored.From the first moment I started telling friends and family that I was retraining to fly the 747, I realised what a special place it holds for people far beyond the industry. It has absolutely captivated the hearts of the flying public and professionals alike.Like Concorde, the jumbo is a renowned aircraft. But I believe it will be missed far more as it was the aircraft many, many more people were on when they fell in love with long-distance travelling. Concorde was an incredible achievement and has its place in history, but you needed very good reason and bountiful resources to afford it - the jumbo was much more welcoming of us all.But for me, during all the more than 10 years I flew the jumbo as a captain, the one thing I never fully got over was the height at which the pilot is still flying when the main gear touches the runway on landing. At that point, you are still moving at three times the height of the average two-storey house.• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/957e657470f1edf6aadc0a37c13977a95d55a15c/68_110_5615_3369/master/5615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02810701b289b0bcdfa82c34c95b0687","title":"lloyds to increase number of black staff in senior roles","story":"High street lender will also publish its first ethnicity pay gap report this yearThe commitment, announced to staff on Thursday, will mean recruiting about 168 more black colleagues into senior roles by 2024.Britain’s biggest high street lender will also publish its first ethnicity pay gap report later this year and include at least one candidate from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background on every executive director shortlist.It will help ensure there is more erse pool of candidates to replace the outgoing chief executive, António Horta-Osório, who will step down next year after a decade at the helm.Currently, the bank only employs about 40 black staff across its 7,000-strong senior management team.

But before getting down to business, gifts were exchanged. It was Merkel’s 66th birthday, and she was presented by Macron with a bottle of fine white bourgogne. Borisov gave her a traditional silver flask containing Bulgarian rose oil. Merkel posed for a photo with Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, also marking his birthday. She gave him a copy of a 17th-century map of Goa, a former Portuguese colony where Costa has family ties.Michel, the European council president, wished the pair a happy birthday and offered congratulations to the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, who got married on Wednesday. She had had to change plans three times when a general election, coronavirus and then this weekend’s summit got in the way.It’s going to be one of those summits, I fear....We’ve got some nice video from inside today’s EU Summit, as mask-clad leaders gathered to debate the proposed Recovery Fund.They didn’t always manage to keep very far apart, but at least they remembered to bump elbows and bow politely, rather than clasping hands.And with Jean-Claude Juncker no longer leading the Commission, there’s less danger of a virus-spreading air kiss...But Netflix took the shine off these results, by predicting that the next few months would be tougher - as the lockdown means it has ‘pulled forward’ so many new customers already.We live in uncertain times with restrictions on what we can do socially and many people are turning to entertainment for relaxation, connection, comfort and stimulation.In Q1 and Q2, we saw significant pull-forward of our underlying adoption leading to huge growth in the first half of this year (26 million paid net adds vs. prior year of 12 million). As a result, we expect less growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the prior year. The US stock market has opened a little higher, as investors juggle optimism about a Covid-19 vaccine against the alarming jump in virus cases.Traders seem to be relaxed about the pandemic, perhaps betting that policymakers will deliver further stimulus measures to protect the economy from fresh lockdowns.EU leaders remained poles apart on the terms of a €1.82tn budget and recovery package as they met for the first time in five months today, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports from Brussels.While Angela Merkel warned of the possibility of talks dragging into a second destabilising summer summit, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told fellow leaders in Brussels they had an “obligation” to agree on a response to an economic downturn unparalleled since the Great Depression.His comments were echoed by Italy’s Giuseppe Conte, whose country, like Spain, was among those hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic and faces a devastating recession.But the German chancellor, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, offered a notably downbeat assessment about the level of unity among leaders going into the meeting, which is slated to finish on Saturday.Arriving at the summit, she said:“The differences are still very large and so I can’t predict that we will achieve a result this time.”“It would be desirable, but we also have to be realistic. And it really does take a great deal of willingness to compromise on the part of everyone if we are to achieve something that is good for Europe. In this respect I expect very difficult negotiations.”The commitment, announced to staff on Thursday, will mean recruiting about 168 more black colleagues into senior roles by 2024.Britain’s biggest high street lender will also publish its first ethnicity pay gap report later this year and include at least one candidate from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background on every executive director shortlist.It will help ensure there is more erse pool of candidates to replace the outgoing chief executive, António Horta-Osório, who will step down next year after a decade at the helm.Just in: The number of new homes being build in America jumped in June, as the economy opened up.This all suggests there was a burst of construction activity as lockdown measures were relaxed, but it is now fading -- just as the Covid-10 pandemic intensifies, with a record 77,300 new cases yesterday.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested that Britain’s economy is recovering, while not speculating what shape the recovery will take.Speaking on a webinar this morning, Bailey“We are seeing activity return. We are beginning to see this recovery.”May’s GDP data, released earlier this week, did show that activity has picked up - but only slowly.So, when asked if he spies a V-shaped recovery (as chief economist Andy Haldane suggested recently), Bailey replied that “We don’t yet know the full story of this”.Bailey also pointed out that the recovery is uneven - car sales and housing transactions have picked up, but the entertainment and hospitality sector is still suffering.The euro is nudging higher in the foreign exchange markets, as traders look for any signs of progress in Brussels today.Despite a mood of caution, the single currency has gained half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.143. That put it close to Wednesday’s four-month high.Against the pound, it’s picked up half a penny to 91.1p.Traders may be anticipating that leaders make some progress today and tomorrow, even if a full-blown agreement to put the €750bn Recovery Fund into action will be a stretch.It could be case of deal, or no deal yet... Brad Bechtel of Jefferies suggests another summit will be needed:The mood is not too optimistic as there seems to be some significant hold outs still but if we were to get some form of agreement that would be quite positive and the worse case is a kick the can down the road meeting for later in the month or early August.Edward Moya of OANDA says Angela Merkel’s prediction of a ‘very tough’ meeting has cooled the markets.US equities fluctuated after German Chancellor Merkel’s cautious comments suggested EU leaders might not be able to reach a compromise at the EU summit. Her comments may have been posturing, but they did sink stocks to their session lows. Negotiations are expected to be tough from the frugal four, but optimism is high that a breakthrough will be made at the two-day summit.A diminutive spectre is stalking the UK’s shops -- the spectre of shrinkflation.Snack maker Mondelez is in the spotlight, after announcing that it is cutting the size of Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks to lower their calorie count.The move means Crunchie, Twirl and Wispa bars will contain no more than 200 calories each when sold in a four-pack, the BBC reports.Cutting the nation’s intake of sugary snacks shouldn’t be knocked... but Mondelez isn’t cutting its own intake of cash, as prices will stay the same. It’s part of a broader move in recent years -- I’m sure that Christmas sweetie tins were rather chunkier in my distant youth, for example.Mark Jones, food \u0026amp drink supply chain expert at law firm Gordons, reckons we’ll see more shrinkflation as the economy struggles.“This is a sign of the times. You may remember in July 2017, the ONS confirmed that 2,529 products shrank in size between January 2012 and June 2017 but their price remained the same. The vast majority of the affected products were food and drink.“Whilst that process has slowed in recent years, we can expect a new wave of shrinking products. The phenomenon was embraced by the market as a consequence of the last recession. No food producers wanted to increase the on-the-shelf price but, at the same time, they needed to cover the cost of rising overheads and limited volume growth in the packaged food market. The solution was to modestly reduce the size as consumers, generally, don’t notice.“Now we are on the brink of another recession, shrinkflation will probably increase again. Only this time, when the producers are caught, they are likely to point to the obesity epidemic as their motivation rather than their margins.”In China, investors are reeling from the worst week’s losses in four months.It was quite a week. Stocks hit a five-year high on Monday, then slid on Tuesday and Wednesday, before a hefty selloff on Thursday.Yesterday’s tumble came after Chinese retail sales shrank unexpectedly in June, while the wider economy returned to growth in Q2. That raised fears that consumption was weak.At the start of last week, State media were encouraging investors to take part in the “healthy bull market”. But the tone did change, urging traders to be cautious...Economists at ING have drawn up a handy graphic laying out the possible scenarios from the EU summit - and how it might move the markets.Their base case is that we see “some progress towards a compromise, but no final agreement” this weekend. That would give the euro a small nudge upwards, they reckon, while an actual deal would give it more strength.With handshakes out, EU leaders have been elbow-bumping:Our Jennifer Rankin is covering the Summit arrivals:French president Emmanuel Macron was hedging his bets too, telling reporters in Brussels that he was confident but cautious.“We will do everything we can to find an agreement”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226c6f30548b190a9b13dfdf6558654d82bd8da5/0_73_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=880da6733964c1a34d465f52b31a97d5","title":"royal opera house lays off entire team casual staff coronavirus","story":"Voluntary redundancy process also under way due to impact of coronavirus crisis on arts sectorThe Royal Opera House has cut its entire team of casual staff, as pressure mounts for the UK government’s emergency arts fund to be quickly rolled out after an estimated 3,000 job losses in the sector.ROH, which is in Covent Garden in London, did not confirm the number of job losses but said a voluntary redundancy process was also under way and that all casual contracts had been terminated.“It is with huge sadness that we have begun a restructure process,” the ROH tweeted. “The scale of financial pressure on ROH alongside continued restrictions on our ability to perform to live audiences, has resulted in this very difficult decision.”The ROH confirmed its chief executive, Alex Beard, had taken “a significant reduction in salary” and the music director, Sir Antonio Pappano, had waived his salary since the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown. Pappano earned a basic salary of £115,000 for the financial year 2016-17, with additional fees of more than £650,000.Beard told the Stage the “sad decision” had been made because of the financial pressure caused by the Covid-19 crisis, coupled with the continued restrictions on its ability to perform to live audiences. “The process has started with a call for voluntary redundancies and the termination of all casual contracts, with a consultation on proposals for changes affecting permanent members of staff due to commence shortly,” he added.The head of Bectu, Philippa Childs, said the trade union was urging ROH to reconsider the move in light of the government’s recently announced £1.57bn emergency arts fund aimed at preserving cultural institutions. Bectu has estimated there have been 3,000 job losses so far in the culture sector as a result of Covid-19.Childs said: “We are very aware that venues still have no income, and no prospect of ticket sales for the foreseeable future, but the government has announced a bailout package for theatre and the arts and on that basis we have urged the Royal Opera House to pause its redundancy and restructuring proposals.”The coronavirus lockdown has prompted some of the UK’s most prominent companies to announce large-scale job losses. The aviation, automotive and retail sectors have been among the worst hit, as businesses adjust to dramatically reduced revenue projections.While the government’s job retention scheme has so far protected millions of jobs, fears are mounting that unemployment will rise as the scheme begins to be phased out from August.Since lockdown began on 23 March, some of the UK’s largest companies have announced plans to cut a total of 60,000 jobs globally, many of which will fall in the UK.Burberry – 500 jobs worldwide15 July: Total includes 150 posts in UK head offices as luxury brand tries to slash costs by £55m after a slump in sales during the pandemic.G4S – 1,150 jobs13 July: The security company G4S plans to make 1,150 workers redundant as it scales back its struggling cash handling business and contends with pandemic-hit cash usage.John Lewis\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp1,300 jobs9 July: John Lewis announced that it is planning to permanently close eight of its 50 stores, including full department stores in Birmingham and Watford, with the likely loss of 1,300 jobs.Celtic Manor\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp450 jobs9 July: Bosses at the Celtic Collection in Newport, which staged golf\u0027s Ryder Cup in 2010 and the 2014 Nato Conference, said 450 of its 995 workers will lose their jobs.Pret a Manger\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp1,000 jobs6 July: Pret a Manger is to permanently close 30 branches and could cut at least 1,000 jobs after suffering “significant operating losses” as a result of the Covid-19 lockdownCasual Dining Group\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp1,900 jobs2 July: The owner of the Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas restaurant chains collapsed into administration, with the immediate loss of 1,900 jobs.

Ziwe talks about the idea behind her live interviews on InstagramHow many Black friends do you have? Can you name five Asian people? Did your ancestors own slaves?If you don’t have the answers to these questions, you might find a new live show by Ziwe Fumudoh, who goes by the stage name Ziwe, incredibly uncomfortable.Then again, discomfort is the raison d’être of the show, which sees Ziwe grill her guests over 30 intense minutes on Instagram live, asking them awkward, difficult and sometimes seemingly impossible questions on race and sexism.Her guests have included many a liberal white woman whom the internet loves to hate, such as the food columnist Alison Roman, the influencer Caroline Calloway and the actor Rose McGowan. But her guests recently have also included Jeremy O Harris, who wrote Slave Play, and the comedian Dana Donnelly.The live, interactive nature of the show allows viewers to chip in, so as guests fumble over questions such as “Qualitatively, what do you like about Black people?” viewers can – and do – roast them in the comments section.Roman apparently likes the way Black people dance and cook – but we’ll never know more because Ziwe stopped Roman short, simply saying: “I’m doing you a favor”. These moments – when Ziwe steps in to save her guests – are a brief reprieve for those who find the show lacking in generosity.But her questioning does, at times, feel torturous. Asking Roman (who faced a backlash after she called Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo – two Asian women – sellouts) to name five Asian people was never going to go well, and even if Roman could name 10, it wouldn’t be particularly illuminating. So what, exactly, is Ziwe trying to achieve with this exercise?Ziwe says she does not want her guests to fail, but she does believe in asking hard questions. “What comes out in my interview tactics is I’m actually trying to be nice, to be kind, to educate, not shame, necessarily,” she says. “Sure, I do it in a way that is really confrontational, but my goal is to help and heal people. I get comments like ‘Ziwe, you hate white people and you’re the devil.’ I don’t think those people necessarily understand the concept of my show or have watched a longer clip,” she tells me on an early morning phone call from her Brooklyn apartment.There are moments when her frank questioning captures something that sensitive questioning cannot. After Caroline Calloway proudly exclaims that she is fed up with white people pretending they’re not racist, Ziwe’s sharp reply – “Oh, so you’re a proud racist?” – reminds us that bragging about doing the bare minimum shouldn’t be commended.After Roman’s numerous defenses for her recipe for a bastardized curry (ingredients: chickpeas, coconut milk, turmeric) which she calls a “stew” – ignoring the recipe’s roots – it was refreshing to hear Ziwe ask: “Would you consider yourself the Christopher Columbus of food influencing?” “No, I wouldn’t,” said an irked Roman, who went on to define a curry as complex, while “a stew is a generic blanket term for like a thick soupy liquid dinner”.Lest you think she is too harsh on her guests, there’s a method to this exchange, Ziwe argues. “Calling someone a proud racist, it’s radical – it seems very cruel and intense and violent but I am actually making the statement that like, ‘Hey, we need to name this thing that is sort of plaguing our nation or else we are doomed.”Some argue that making people feel embarrassed is not a good way to tackle racism, but that often overlooks the other person in the debate: the person who is afflicted by a racist, sexist or homophobic comment, but has to prioritize the feelings of the offender above their own.In other words: why are we more worried about being called a racist than being racist?Considering she is a comedian, not an activist, to burden Ziwe with the far from enviable task of curing racist America with her show could be considered presumptuous. Why should her job be to change minds, rather than make people laugh? But she tells me it is supposed to be political during our interview, so I send her a text after our call and ask her whether the accusation is ever leveled at her:“Ziwe, I’m wondering, do you ever get people saying things to you like: ‘If you really want to change minds this is not the way to go about it. You’re putting people off you’re probably only talking to people who agree with you.”“Nothing that literally, but here is a tweet I got tagged in,” she replies, sending me a screen-grab of a tweet, in which someone says: “I struggle to see how things like Ziwe’s ‘gotcha’ tactics are helping anything at all.”“How did that make you feel? Do you buy it?” I ask.“I disagree, but I encourage those who don’t approve of my tactics to join me in finding positive ways to effect change. I’m just doing my best like everyone else,” she says.Ziwe argues there are no wrong or right answers on her show, just honest ones. “The questions are designed to be impossible because ultimately the way that we are dealing with race is impossible. To pretend that you don’t have a racist bone in your body, that’s a fallacy, that is not based in reality,” she says as she suppresses an exasperated laugh. “It’s not an impossible question if you just say what you think,” she says.There are, obviously, incorrect answers. The internet has a furious appetite for wrongdoing: people are swallowed whole for making mistakes, and people often love to pile on, to admonish the wrongdoer. When this happens, there is no compassion, no context, just right and wrong – only, right and wrong constantly changes, and people’s moral compasses expand, shift and change overtime. At least her guests are showing they want to learn. But Ziwe doesn’t really believe in cancel culture. “People who get ‘cancelled’ never really get cancelled, right? They get a lot of press and they are trending on Twitter but I don’t know if we see legitimate repercussions in their lives,” she says. “I think if you say racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist stuff then yeah, people are gonna be mad at you, and you shouldn’t be surprised or go home like a boo-hoo baby and cry. You deserve everything that comes to you, right?”This is a confusing set of statements, and relate to the main criticism that can be made of the show. If cancel culture is not real – with its victims suffering no concrete consequences outside of having their profiles elevated as the internet obsesses over them for weeks – it would be fair to ask whether Ziwe’s show feeds that publicity machine. Some will say there are impacts (Roman’s New York Times column was suspended after her comments about Teigen and Kondo).Still, to describe the show as simple “gotcha” comedy or a show based on the celebrity status of the formerly “cancelled” misses the mark. Ziwe’s former show, Baited, also used reductive questioning to remind us of our racial biases. In it, Ziwe deliberately race-baits her guests as a device to make people think about the way that we discuss race.In one episode, the tables are turned: Ziwe is interviewed by the completely un-baitable comedian Aparna Nancherla, who tries to get Ziwe to do something racist. They play a game where Ziwe has to help Nancherla guess the name of a celebrity – normally an ethnic minority with an accent. Ziwe seems uncomfortable, but she won’t bite. “I want the audience to see these excruciating, hard questions and say, ‘Hey, how would I answer that question?’ I want to point out my guests’ racial biases, the audience’s racial biases and my own racial biases. I am constantly trying to critique culture. So if you’re asking me who am I laughing at? Everyone! Including myself, always!”It might be cringe-making to watch, but Ziwe warns that she doesn’t want you to just feel angry at Caroline Calloway when you watch her interview – she wants you to think about how Calloway is a product of the world we live in.She wants people to come away from the show equipped to have these conversations – something she could not do when she was younger.“I remember going to prep school, going to university, and I didn’t have the vocabulary where I could have these really tough conversations to really confront racism. I didn’t have the vocabulary to defend myself,” she says.For her, the show is not just radical, it’s a kind of therapy: “I am trying to think about my younger self.

The birds are also also known as lammergeiers, which translates as “lamb killers” and refers to the false belief that the birds killed lambs and sheep.The vulture is a wild-hatched bird that originates from either the Alps or the Pyrenees, according to José Tavares, the director of the Vulture Conservation Foundation, which runs a bearded vulture reintroduction scheme across Europe.“It is common for young bearded vultures to leave the mountains and explore vast areas, but it is unusual for this species to cross over large bodies of water, which in this case was the English Channel,” Tavares said.“The bird will most likely attempt to return home in the future, but it is difficult to predict when or which route it will take.”Like all vultures, bearded vultures are scavengers but are unique in that they are the only bird to live on a diet made up almost exclusively of bones, meaning they pose no threat to farm animals or game birds. In the Peak District, the vulture has been seen feeding on the bones of a dead sheep.Birdwatchers planning on seeing the bird this weekend are being asked to ensure its safety.“We’re really excited that a rare bearded vulture has chosen to roost on National Trust land in the Peak District,” said Rachel Bennett, a National Trust ranger.“However, it’s vital that we all do everything we can not to disturb the bird while it is here. We want to make sure it’s protected and safe, as well as looking after the surrounding wildlife and other visitors, as well as our local community.”While the vulture is protected under EU law, there are fears for its future.“There are obvious concerns for the bird’s safety as it’s currently within the worst 10km square for raptor persecution in England, dominated by land used for driven grouse shooting,” said Mark Thomas, the head of investigations at the RSPB.“It’s great that the bird is effectively being protected by the admiring public and birdwatchers.”Tim Birch, from Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, believes the vulture’s presence in the uplands of the Peak District gives us a glimpse of what a wilder future could look like.He said: “Much of our charismatic wildlife remains missing from the Peak District national park including pine martens and hen harriers along with healthy populations of peregrines and goshawks. We will all benefit along with wildlife when our national parks and the environment becomes wilder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884c16c3490b5b97485a30323814eb4a6313d950/0_160_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9394a121f22805365eb4ba012e1407da","title":"share your photos from the big butterfly count 2020","story":"As the world’s biggest butterfly count gets underway once again, we’d like to see photos of what you’ve seenToday sees the start of the UK’s annual Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation, which asks people to spend 15 minutes in an outdoor space and count the amount and type of butterflies, and some day-flying moths, they see.We’d like to hear about the butterflies that you spot too – and we’d also like to see photographs, if you’re lucky enough to capture them.

Now, the Clockwork Orange star is reconciled to a life of golf, gangster flicks and the odd glimpse of geniusMalcolm McDowell was the insolent prince of early-70s cinema, the Liverpool salesman who stormed the establishment’s barricades. You can see him on screen in Lindsay Anderson’s If…., kickstarting a bloody revolution inside an English public school. You can see him in Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, hanging with his droogs at the Korova milk-bar, making up his rassoodock what to do with the night. The sky was the limit. The world was his oyster. One felt he could achieve pretty much anything.If McDowell’s life was a movie, he would either have gone on to be crowned king or he would have exploded and vanished, ideally before he turned 30. But real life has a way of monkeying with the script, which may explain why McDowell is now a snowy-haired 77-year-old. He is a father of five, an avid golfer and a jobbing Hollywood actor specialising in baddies. His wild youth is behind him. He has made peace with his lot. “I had an incredible first few years,” he explains. “And of course that was the golden age. But you can’t keep playing the rebel for ever.”Every now and then he’ll land a peach of a part. Last year he played Rupert Murdoch in the #MeToo drama Bombshell. But his filmography also includes titles such as Abnormal Attraction and Death Race 2050, Kids vs Monsters and Meet the Small Potatoes. He has appeared in nearly 300 productions, many of which he forgot the instant he walked off the set. “People stop me and say: ‘Oh, we loved you in blah-blah’ and I say: ‘Sorry, that wasn’t me.’ And then they’ll show me on their phone or show me the DVD cover and sure enough, there I am.” He chuckles. “And I have no memory of doing it at all.”In his latest film, The Big Ugly, he plays a London gangster at large in the US, intent on laundering dirty money through the green hills of Appalachia. Billed below Vinnie Jones and above Ron Perlman, McDowell comes weaving through the action with a weaselly menace and a face like a clenched fist. It’s the sort of polished, dependable B-movie performance that must feel almost second nature by now.Happily, McDowell remembers The Big Ugly. They shot the film in Kentucky, deep in the boondocks at the height of summer. He recalls boarding at the Motel 6 and eating biscuits and grits at the local Cracker Barrel. “I had my 14-year-old son staying with me. He got so bored and it got so hot. That steamy southern heat that Tennessee Williams writes about. The only thing to do was drive to Walmart and walk around this big air-conditioned building to keep cool. That was the excitement. That was the big thing to look forward to. Breakfast at Cracker Barrel and then we’ll hit Walmart. After a week, he said: ‘You know what, Dad? I think I’d like to go home and see Mum.’”Just lately, of course, McDowell has been at home a lot, too. He lives with his third wife, Kelley, in a small town near LA but says the effects of the pandemic have largely passed him by. The main drag is that he was booked in to have his left knee replaced but the operation kept being cancelled it’s finally happening tomorrow. “I’ve been winging it for long enough,” he says. “Hobbling about, bone-on-bone.”He was a child of the aspirational postwar working-class. His dad ran a pub in Burscough in West Lancashire, the Bull and Dog. In his youth, McDowell worked at the Planters’ nut factory and as a coffee sales rep before alighting in London. He had a confident swagger and an air of dancing mischief. He went about life as though it were a game to be played, or a set of rules to be broken. “You’re a Brechtian actor,” Lindsay Anderson told him. “They know that you’re acting but the audience believes you anyway.”The collaboration with Anderson was like a marriage, he says. Spats, rows and make-ups. They made three fine films together, chasing the character of If….’s Mick Travis through the capitalist hunting grounds of O Lucky Man to the floundering society of Britannia Hospital. And it was thanks to If.… that he landed the role of Alex DeLarge in the vicious, playful A Clockwork Orange, prancing about Thamesmead in bovver boots and a bowler hat. “Fiftieth anniversary next year,” he says. “Where does the time go?”At the peak of his fame he starred in Caligula, a fevered Roman epic bankrolled by Penthouse magazine. The production sounds hilarious it was basically two films in one. First, McDowell played the mad emperor alongside a classy lineup of actors that included Helen Mirren, John Gielgud and Peter O’Toole. Then the producers brought in adult performers to shoot hardcore sex scenes to be deployed as extended cutaways, seemingly at random, so as to give the impression that McDowell was gazing wistfully at a lesbian orgy, or a gladiator getting a blowjob. “There’s quite a good movie in there somewhere,” he says. “But not the porn stuff.”McDowell’s imitation of Gielgud is perfect. He catches the man’s mellifluous delivery and querulous top note. “He’d say: ‘Oh, my accountant says I have to make cutbacks but I don’t see where I can.’ And I’d say, “Well, you’ve got a huge house, John.’ He’d say: ‘Oh yes, but I can’t sell that.’ ‘Well OK, but don’t you have a chauffeur-driven Rolls?’ ‘But, but – how do you think I’m going to get into London?’ ‘How about the train?’ ‘Oh, but I couldn’t do that. The train indeed!’ And I’d say” “Well, that’s why you’re having to do movies like this one, John.’”At the end of the decade, McDowell went to Hollywood to play the role of HG Wells in the film Time After Time. There he met the American actor Mary Steenburgen. The marriage eventually ended but by then he had put down roots. Looking back, he seems more nostalgic for his old London house than for the British film career he abandoned. “It was just off Church Street, near Notting Hill Gate, back of the Czech embassy. Painter’s studio. A unique building. I bought it in 1969 and sold it the first year that Blair got in. And my Aunt Vera lived there for longer than I did. I said: ‘You can stay here, Auntie, I’ll be back in three months.’ Then I went to Hollywood, met Mary, fell in love, had two children. Never went back.”England at the time felt too small, too parochial. Whereas the US was enormous, almost too big to handle. “I was out of my depth,” he admits. “So I played the heavy. The Brit. Which is sort of boring, but unfortunately that’s the way things worked out. When you move to a country like America, you’re a very small fish in a very big pond.”I’m interested to hear McDowell’s side of the story. Reading the cuttings, one gets a different take: the sense of an actor who somehow squandered his promise and let his audience down, possibly out of spite. The critic David Thomson refers to his “strange, thwarted career”. The biographer Roger Lewis describes his later years with an undisguised glee (“his pretty boy looks faded and he was condemned to playing villains in straight-to-video films that turn up on Channel 5”). It’s as though McDowell’s progress offends our collective sensibility. We hate to think of Peter Pan growing up to become a footsoldier in Neverland. The children of the revolution must never ever play golf.I ask whether he is as excited by acting as he was in his youth and he says that he is by and large, it depends on the part. “I still love it, otherwise I wouldn’t do it. Maybe in my forties I didn’t have a good time. People didn’t know what to do with me. I was a useful rebel in the 60s and 70s. But the Kubrick movie was overbearing. Everything was measured against A Clockwork Orange, which gets a little old. But that’s what happens when you work with giants.”Kubrick, in the end, was too controlling, “too brutal”, to properly bond with. But he adored Anderson and was great friends with Robert Altman. Those were his giants. Maybe there are others still out there. From time to time he will overhear his sons discussing new directors they love artists who seem to share the same bold and freewheeling style. “But I’m an old fossil these days. So I sit still and stay quiet.”Far be it for me to moonlight as his manager, but if he hears that there are exciting young film-makers hiding in the woods, why not seek them out? Better that, surely, than another third-billed slot as a photo-fit Mr Knuckles, another film he has forgotten as soon as it is put in the can.“No,” McDowell says, “I’m not going to seek them out. If they offer me something, I’ll do it. But do I want to go parading around actively looking for work? No. Because I don’t have the ambition to be above the title, doing this, that and the other. I really don’t care. I’ve had an amazing run, an incredible career, when you take it all into account.”Maybe this is the arc of most actors’ careers. Maybe it’s not just actors either. We start out looking for the biggest stage, the biggest challenge, the project with the potential to turn the world on its head. We finish up with a different set of requirements: a regular pay-cheque, some half-decent colleagues and a work trip somewhere warm, preferably near a golf course. McDowell – gifted, vibrant actor though he is – once said he would rather hit a home run than win an Academy Award. He tells me that this was partly meant as a joke but that actually he did hit a home run one time and it’s the most exhilarating thing, a feeling that lasts for ever.On top of that, he has never especially been a believer in prizes. It has always struck him as funny, the way the Academy lavishes acting Oscars on the movies with the best script and the best direction, the ones that are already so good that the actor barely makes any difference. The voters, he feels, are coming at it arse-backwards. Those aren’t the films where the real heavy lifting takes place.McDowell casts his mind back over his own long list of credits. The gangster flicks and the sci-fi knock-offs. The kids’ animations that few kids ever saw. He says: “I sometimes think: ‘My God, I’ve just acted in a real piece of shit and I managed to produce a credible performance. I managed to turn that piece of shit into something watchable.’ That’s what’s worthy of an acting award.”The Big Ugly is out on 24 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/923a3c8fb9b1bdd271383e68728bc1604453807a/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=db2f8db60078560e0cf835634d3a02a2","title":"amazonico amazonegroni pineapple cocktail recipe","story":"A pineapple-infused take on an all-time classicYou’ll need to make this a day ahead, to give the fresh pineapple time to infuse with the alcohol.

Wearing hi-vis shirts, wellies and waders, they were the only ones who got close. Cars passed by beeping but on the street there were more police than people. Usually the scene of celebration, thousands gathering, this time fans had been asked to stay away and the men who had won the league weren’t coming either.They were 15km north-east. “We would have liked be there at Cibeles with the fans, but there will be time for that and they’ll be happy watching at home,” Zinedine Zidane said. Around him, the floor was soon covered in confetti and his players wore commemorative T-shirts. We Are The Champions boomed around and a celebratory banquet was prepared, burger and chips the dinner of champions. But this was their training ground, not the Santiago Bernabéu, and when Sergio Ramos lifted the trophy only a couple of hundred people were there to see it: staff, ballboys, six reporters and Villarreal standing politely to applaud. It was, the manager said: “Strange for everyone.” It had been that kind of season.Yet if there had been no wild celebration, no open-topped bus on the day that Spain paid tribute to almost 30,000 victims of coronavirus and figures brought fears of a more outbreaks and renewed restrictions, there was nothing empty in the embraces. Madrid’s manager felt fulfilled, more than ever before. “I don’t have the words I feel huge emotion,” he said. He also described it as one of the most significant days of his life. For the man who has won a trophy every 19 games, the day he won La Liga stood above all those European Cups, not last because of how far they had come. The longest season had ended with Madrid’s third league in 12 years, just as he had hoped it would.“Our season will be good, I’m convinced,” Zidane had said almost exactly a year ago. Which might sound standard enough, the usual pre-season optimism soon bitten by reality, but that was in New York where his side had just let in seven against Atlético Madrid. “One great team and one set of ruins,” judged one front cover there was “no football, no fight, no plan.” Only there was, and from the rubble came the champions, the hint of a new culture emerging at a club where Europe had eclipsed all else. “Zidane built the plan the league was our objective from the start,” said Thibaut Courtois on Thursday night.It wasn’t smooth and it wasn’t always sparkling, but slowly something was building even if it wasn’t with the tools Zidane had in mind. Paul Pogba hadn’t arrived, while James Rodríguez and Gareth Bale hadn’t gone, their moves blocked after the defeat to Atlético. They were destined to play minor roles – unlike the men in whom Zidane trusted when others didn’t, club included. This is not a new side, at least not when it comes to the names. Eight players have started more than 20 league games and all of them were there already. Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric are 34, Marcelo and Karim Benzema 32, Kroos 30. Between them, they have 54 seasons at the club some didn’t want them to have any more. If earlier in the season it so often felt like Madrid relied on the dynamic presence of Fede Valverde, and while Vinicius was decisive in the clásico, ultimately this feels like the success of the old guard, trusted and revived by Zidane.Built around a spine of seven+two that have almost always played – Courtois, Carvajal, Ramos, Raphaël Varane, MendyMarcelo, Casemiro, Kroos, ModricValverde and Benzema – Madrid have won a league in which they’ve had minimal contributions from their new arrivals (Mendy apart) and even less from their four most expensive players, including their two most costly signings ever and four of the all-time top six. Bale, Hazard, Jovic and Rodríguez cost €336m for an average of 8.75 games and 1.5 goals. With Hazard struggling with injuries, Benzema has led, scoring 21 league goals that’s more than all the other forwards put together. The second top scorer is Ramos, on 10.And yet at every step, there have been key contributions at key moments. Twenty-one different men have scored: of the outfield players, only Éder Militão and Brahim Díaz (39 minutes) have not. They went top at Valladolid in January, Nacho Fernández heading in the only goal and Zidane talking about the significance of set plays. The week before Casemiro scored both against Sevilla. At Getafe, Varane scored two from set plays. At Alavés, Dani Carvajal and Ramos scored. All that in a seven-week run than included 0-0 draws at Athletic and Barcelona and a 95th-minute equaliser at Valencia, scored when Courtois went up for a corner.There were glimpses of something more expansive – Eibar, Leganés – but that idea was taking shape. There was variety in their formations – 4-3-3, 4-5-1 4-4-2 – they pressed higher than before and the ball was brought out cleaner now, while there was also a tighter structure than in Zidane’s first spell. Solidity and seriousness were the foundation stone, an idea more pronounced after the pandemic but there from the start. When Madrid dropped points in week two, giving the ball away, Zidane complained that they should have just booted the bloody thing. In week five he did something even he hadn’t done before: took a Madrid team to the Sanchez Pizjuán and won 1-0, the word solidarity a recurring theme afterwards. Two weeks after, they drew the derby 0-0, Courtois responding to suggestions of conservatism by saying: “We weren’t going to go mad.” “Solidity is very important it’s what gives you life,” Zidane added. “If we’re defensively strong, OK. We’ll do something in attack.”Not that it was perfect. Beaten by Mallorca in the autumn, there were doubts. And had they lost in Istanbul in October, Zidane might not have survived. They came through those and went top when they defeated Barcelona in March, but that was their only win in four league games. Out of the Copa del Rey, they lost to Manchester City in Europe too. The week after the clásico, they lost at Betis and Barcelona were leaders again, the situation delicate. And then everything stopped.When it restarted, it was something else. Not so much two halves as two different things clumsily welded together, like From Dusk Til Dawn. Barcelona had never really convinced even when they led, the team desperately trying to keep the club’s crisis at bay, and now they started to collapse, dropping eight of the last 30 points on course to finish with their fewest points in over a decade. Meanwhile, Madrid got stronger, the new context suiting them. If Zidane had changed Madrid’s culture, it is also true that something shifted when the league became more like the Champions League, the target within touching distance, a sole focus. Five weeks to get through and nothing else, 11 games to glory. Or 10, as it turned out.“Lockdown was good for us, to react and take the return super seriously: there was no margin for error in our minds,” Ramos admitted. “What makes now different is that after lockdown when they came back they wanted to do great things you could see it in the training sessions they wanted to do more, and that tells you everything,” Zidane revealed. Everything else stripped away – the noise, the tension, the intangibles, all those elements that bring equality – they were too strong. “When their fifth sub is Kroos …” Athletic manager Gaizka Garitano said. The former Madrid manager Bernd Schuster even suggested that it might even have been good for them to play behind closed doors, away from the pressure of the Bernabéu, where those tight games are a problem, not a pathway. One that led inevitably to the title, with 10 wins from 10, just four goals let in.Since the restart Madrid have never been behind, let alone beaten. They started two points behind and finished seven points in front it wasn’t always brilliant – although the second half against Valencia and the first in Granada were superb – but it brokered little argument. They didn’t even need all their games. Zidane insisted that the title race would run until the last day but for once he was wrong. Victory against Villarreal meant that Madrid won the league with a game to spare.After everything that happened, everything he believes in, all the doubts that he knows are there – even from within own club, even from within his own mind – this was the competition Zidane wanted most of all. No one had appreciated Barcelona’s titles like him, which is why no one appreciated this quite like him. The league was the true test, he kept insisting, the proof that you’re the best, reason enough to visit Cibeles, even if that has to be some other day. “The Champions League is the Champions League,” Zidane said late on Thursday, “but, the Spanish league, pfff … the Spanish league is the dog’s bollocks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8813fdd191c970c0c1583c64a2dede0041130577/0_318_4799_2881/master/4799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b8ddc39d2f1c57fb318e9d73569e9be","title":"huddersfield v west brom championship live","story":"Team news news: Slaven Bilic tweaks things from West Brom’s draw with Fulham in midweek, with Matt Phillips and Hal Robson-Kanu replacing Kamil Grosicki and Charlie Austin. Meanwhile Karlan Grant drops to the bench for Huddersfield.Oh how West Brom need this. They kick-off the penultimate round of Championship fixtures knowing victory against Huddersfield will inch them closer to a Premier League return. But the jitters have well and truly started and should they slip up once more, their fate will tumble out of their hands and into the laps of Brentford, who have won all seven games since the restart. But Leeds, too, will be watching with great interest. Well, Marcelo Bielsa and his staff might not be – presumably they will be glued to The Chase, another kind of pulsating climax – but fans will, oddly, be willing on their Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield, who can inadvertently promote Leeds should they prevent Slaven Bilic’s side from picking up all three points.Bilic has maintained those below them would sooner be in West Brom’s position but they are wobbling and Brentford are breathing down their necks, just one point behind them despite being 10 points adrift when the season was halted. “The key is to be very calm,” he said. “We have to share that pressure. It has always been in our own hands. It has been that way since September. From round seven, you’re checking on other results.

Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a371e11d8c0194b16ba2ad85052f592fafd61558/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e65dd308a467c45f3bb10e9faf011db","title":"we sold the most books ever in a month how an inclusive bookseller adapted during lockdown","story":"Lynsey Pollard’s family-run business champions ersity in children’s books. Using Google tools helped Little Box of Books become a bestsellerLynsey Pollard picks up her phone from the kitchen table and pans the camera around to reveal dozens of boxes stacked through the living room behind her. “There’s another bookcase full downstairs and some in the hallway,” she says. “You should have seen it two months ago you could barely move. We even had to store them under the bed.”It’s been a hectic three months for the director of Little Box of Books, a subscription service for children’s books she runs with her partner Neil Langston from their London flat. In mid-March, just before the coronavirus lockdown, they took the risk of ordering a three-month supply of books instead of the normal one-month’s supply.“We had no idea how business would go, how our suppliers would manage or if they’d even exist afterwards,” Pollard says. “We wondered what would happen if one of us got sick. Neil also runs an IT consultancy and we’ve got an 18-month-old and a six-year-old to look after. For a two-person business, it was quite intimidating.”Pollard credits Google tools for the surge. “Google My Business has helped us to help our customers,” she explains. “We could let them know we were still open for business and fully stocked up. It is amazing to have a versatile and visible storefront apart from the website that drives traffic to our products, helping people to find us and trust us.”For Pollard and Langston, who founded the company in 2018 with the aim of bringing greater ersity to kids’ bookshelves at home and in school, this enhanced ability to create awareness of their product and capitalise on it is central to not just their business, but to their mission.Pollard, who previously worked in charity communications, had the idea during a period as a single mum to her eldest son. “I just didn’t see our family in any of the stories I was reading to him.” Now, each month, after scouring scores of publishing lists, she sends customers hand-wrapped books and other learning resources that include characters with different racial backgrounds, disabilities, step-parents, single parents, two mums, two dads and anything else that more accurately reflects the society we live in.Pollard and Langston hadn’t even finished testing their website, but she soon found herself on Sky News discussing the study and her new business. To make the most of the media exposure at the time, Pollard started using Google ads so her website would appear when people searched for more erse books. “It helped bring us our first customers who weren’t friends or family,” says Pollard. “That was such a great feeling, to know that people wanted to buy our product.”“We thought books and learning resources that would transport them outside of their family bubble during this time could be important,” says Pollard. “So we created ads to reference that, and help more people to find us.”Pollard says Google tools have enabled their business to reach an entirely new audience in recent months. “They have brought hundreds of people to us who may not have realised that most children’s books don’t accurately reflect the world we live in today. I love that it’s why we set up the company. I’ll continue to update my Google My Business as another place where people can find our business.”There’s a social element to all that Pollard and Langston do. For every box purchased, they send one to London-based child literacy charity Doorstep Library. And since March, each new order has received a stamped envelope addressed to a care home resident, so children can write letters or draw pictures for older people who are isolated.When we speak, anti-racism protests have spread from the US to the UK, further highlighting the need for greater ersity on children’s bookshelves. Pollard is already noticing the impact on her business. “People want to do better for their kids. Sometimes they just need a little help. We’d love it if all children could see themselves in stories. Then instead of talking about ‘erse books’, we could just talk about ‘books’.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd5768d253d9a63e17d7252950e98744d03d90f/0_289_4980_2989/master/4980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=148c861222ddee009795270c789e25ac","title":"childrens sleep severely affected coronavirus experts anxiety routine","story":"Warning as anxiety and lack of routine lead to rise in inquiries at clinics The coronavirus crisis is having a significant impact on children’s sleep, with anxiety and lack of routine causing serious disruption, experts and charities have warned.“At the moment we are very busy,” the clinic’s founder Mandy Gurney said. “We have definitely seen a spike in six- to eight-year-old children with anxiety impacting their sleep. And for younger ones who are not seeing other babies in parenting groups – I think it will be hard when they start to go out more”.She added: “Parents are also finding it hard to keep older children’s or teenagers sleep’ on track, as the temptation to lie in is very strong when there is no school to get up for.”A survey of 2,700 people in April gave the early warning sign about the long-term negative impact coronavirus is having on children’s sleep.It supports a newly published paper from the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry that suggests the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen during and following the pandemic is high.In Lincolnshire, a sleep service started by the Sleep Charity saw 90 people in March 2020, with 169 on the waiting list.“We are definitely very busy and seeing an awful lot of children with a late sleep phase, so they are finding it hard to go to sleep at a normal time and not falling asleep until late,” said Lisa Artis, the deputy chief executive of the Sleep Charity. “It’s triggered by not having regulated routine but also anxiety.” She added that parents were finding it hard too, because they have little respite and children are not able to exercise as they normally would. “We have had some sad cases where families found themselves separating because of the pressure, so deciding to live separately for a period of time because of the general pressure with sleep being part of it.”In May, researchers from King’s College London conducted a survey of 2,254 people to ascertain how the virus outbreak and lockdown has impacted their sleep. Almost half of 16- to 24-year-olds said they were sleeping fewer hours than they had been prior to lockdown. In comparison, a third of those aged 35 and older said the same.“Coronavirus has had a significant impact on sleep,” said Dr Michael Farquhar, a consultant in paediatric sleep medicine at Evelina London at Guys and St Thomas’ NHS trust. “Teenagers are often trying to be forced into a sleep pattern that is not natural for their biological pattern. They may want to get up later and society and school forces them into a pattern of getting up earlier but lockdown lets that sleep pattern drift.”The Evelina London hospital has released some tips on sleep, advising exercise during the day and getting outside. They also said to make sure curtains are closed and lights dim at night, as well as introducing a calming bedtime routine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c194c9bc9b55c02241aad687637e6c0754f9be53/956_956_3195_1917/master/3195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c51254e8481abe96e076cf45fba001e6","title":"experience im an irish dancing tiktok star","story":"Beyoncé’s mum reposted my video, and Leo Varadkar invited me to Ireland for St Patrick’s DayI created my TikTok account shortly before the pandemic. I first heard about it from some of the younger kids at my dance school. They were doing all these viral dances with choppy choreography, so I gave it a go. I was terrible! I tried to learn the routine to Savage, a song by Megan Thee Stallion and Beyoncé, but I couldn’t move fluidly. So I tried Irish dancing to it, instead, doing the tricky footwork like rocks and toe-stands, trebles, drums.To my surprise, hip-hop works well with Irish dance choreography: you can tap out the beats with your shoes. I posted a video in the evening at about 3am, I woke up and there were thousands of comments in everything from Russian to Chinese, and so many from people in Ireland. When the Irish author Emma Dabiri posted it on Twitter, even more flocked to my page.I started getting Facebook friend requests from older Irish people saying how much joy it gives them to see me dance, and that my mum must be so proud – it’s very cute. The video has had more than 1m views even Beyoncé’s mum reposted it. In the space of a few days, I had been tweeted by the then taoiseach Leo Varadkar. He wrote: “Some brilliant moves there, we’d love to have you over,” and invited me to Ireland to dance on St Patrick’s Day.I did an interview on Irish radio where they surprised me by having the director of Riverdance, Padraic Moyles, on the phone. He told me what I was doing was unique and asked me to take part in the touring show. I would definitely have gone to see it when it came to Virginia now I’m going to be in it.Since then, I’ve posted other TikToks of me dancing to tracks by Drake, Koffee, Doja Cat, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson. The comments have been mostly celebratory, but some people said that, as a black woman, I’m appropriating Irish culture. I’m passionate about Irish dance, teaching and my identity as a young woman of colour, so the comments about “cultural appropriation” were quite hurtful. I feel like they’ve come from people who don’t understand the term.Irish dance is like any other cultural art form, it was created to be shared. It’s a dance that was born out of oppression we can’t lose sight of that. For me, as a little black girl, it was a beautiful art I was desperate to be a part of. I was 10 when I first saw an Irish dancing recital, at the dance school where I was learning tap and ballet. I was mesmerised. My mum was a bit incredulous at first, but she let me give it a shot. I fell in love after my first class.Now I’m 20, and Irish dancing is my life. Competitions aren’t that regular in Virginia, but until recently I was travelling every weekend to compete in major events elsewhere in the US, or international shows in Glasgow, Dublin and London. I came 43rd in the last world championships in 2019 – that might not sound huge, but getting into the top 50 is a big achievement.I addressed the negative feedback in a post on social media by explaining that there are Irish dance schools all over the world. The supportive response was overwhelming and it felt like an educational moment. People in the US tell me they want to pick it up and are searching for schools, and Irish people are looking for their heavy shoes from childhood. The most surreal moment was a black mother telling me she let her daughter sign up for Irish dance classes because she saw me. I didn’t have someone who looked like me to look up to in what is historically a very white space. That I can be that person for young black dancers is an honour.Dance has been an outlet to take my mind off the craziness of the world. I teach my pre-kindergarten kids Irish dancing – they love the high kicks – and I’m pursuing my teaching certification. My plan is to go back to competing I just have to recover from some injuries. The Riverdance tour has been postponed for now, but when it comes to Virginia I’ll be there, dancing in the show. It will be a dream come true.• As told to Anna Cafolla.Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

The show had never been shy about the incestuous love affair between art and commerce, and so it proved a workable vessel for a commercial that needed to be delivered with a no-BS wink. If we’re going to sell to you, the opening tacitly stated, the least we can do is show a little shame and get some laughs out of it.It’s in this spirit that the gang gets back together for one last ride, which just so happens to be in the form of an hour-long special pushing the next year of content from the benevolent overlords at NBC Universal. It’s a devilishly apt pairing, the orgy of synergy that is TV upfronts presentation and the unlikely 30 Rock revival – a deeply cynical attempt to milk nostalgia for a show about TV deeply cynical attempts to cash in on our sentimentality. That may seem like a weighty concept to convey in the lacunae between sizzle reels, but by the comfortingly unchanged comic sensibility of these writers, that can come across in an insert shot of Kenneth Parcell’s soul gasping out of his body as he prostrates himself before advertisers.He’s the chairman of NBC these days, a paradigm shift set up by the series finale back in 2013, though he has not parted with his country habit of eating chickpeas from a can. (Jack McBrayer also portrays his sultry assistant Vivica, easily the show’s most inspired gag.) The new episode, a word justified here by the structure and occasionally even the rhythm of a normal hour of entertainment, gets rapid-fire laughs from checking in on the happily-ever-afters not previously laid out. Hapless beta male Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) has reinvented himself as a goth-styled rock star, much to the pleasure of his wife, Paula incurable eccentric Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) has moved to Canada, where he spends his free time polishing his hockey sticks using maple syrup, as Canadians are wont to do horndog Frank (Judah Friedlander) was consulting at children’s program Peppa Pig, until he was let go for keeping pornography around the office.These feel like real set-ups for real jokes, made under the permissive auspices of a moneyed conglomerate. Some guest appearances had an intrusive incompatibility to them (for the love of all that is holy, must we watch one of the Kardashians toddle her way through scripted comedy?), and the mandate to set up each clip-package segment with a couple lines of dialogue couldn’t avoid the core shill-ness. Still, the TV-history-literate 30 Rock would be the first to remind us that Milton Berle’s first show on NBC had Texaco right in the title. Same as it ever was, except for the group Zooms.But this show in particular returns with a higher mandate than simply being funny. Topicality was so integral to its DNA that today, every new world happening generates a fresh wave of tweets wondering how 30 Rock would have satirized it. The series has been the subject of some controversy in recent weeks, as Americans remembered en masse that a handful of episodes included blackface, and it would have been comic cowardice to let the issue sit. The writers make an early overture toward simple contrition with one joke re-dubbing “Toofer” (so nicknamed because he’s a twofer hire, as a black man and a Harvard graduate) as James, but the engagement gets even more substantive. We learn that prima donna Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) has been canceled, and that she’s been losing her mind since landing in “famous person jail”.Though the public turned on Jenna for defecating in a Thermos belonging to Mandy Moore, she must nonetheless sort through the thorny politics of “cancel culture”. She makes the hollow justifications that Fey herself knows not to, rationalizing that “the late 2010s were a different time!” After some duly hilarious wallows in self-pity (quarantine has been hardest on “hot extroverts”, apparently), she arrives at the realization that she can do nothing but own up to the wrongness of what she’s done and throw herself at the public’s mercy. And because this is a sitcom, this also involves her using a musical number about the new streaming service Peacock to force Moore to accept her apology.A well-calibrated harmony between earnestness and irony powered the engine that made 30 Rock go, and the old bucket still runs like a dream after all these years. Remorse must be tempered by a resolution to remain uncouth, just as a professional agreement to play a little ball must be undercut by subversive sniggering. Even as they grease the giant grinding cogs, the staff can expose the absurdity of corporate doctrine by delivering its soulless messaging with maximum enthusiasm. These writers have known for years how easily promo copy can be made to sound sarcastic, that it takes nothing more than the mere suggestion of a carbon-based organism ever actually using the phrase “dynamic new platform”.After a while, the ads themselves start to play like cold punchlines, as if each new real show had been conceived as a bit by comedy writers. The lines about such fictitious titles as Dracula PD and Merlin: The Teenage Years sound no more implausible than the sitcom about the boyhood antics of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, which is real. Right? If nothing else, this will be the lasting legacy of 30 Rock. Every time a new season of TV brings us something that seems too dumb to be true – every time that “too dumb to be true” seems like it might be the very essence of the televisual medium, an inkling never stronger than during upfronts season – its genius will grow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecccc90ad2af5295e2c052391c2ac38193b5bd1/0_180_768_461/master/768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae283c4361018846829a2a0db308fe2","title":"a single use face mask or one like amber heards how i learnt to choose wisely","story":"As more countries make coverings compulsory, Nazia Parveen experiences face mask envy during a work trip to MallorcaParis Hilton likes hers made from mesh, encrusted with rhinestones, Amber Heard and Johnny Depp have opted to wear bandanas for their dramatic daily court appearances. Meanwhile, for most of us it’s the disposable versions that can be bought from most high-street chemists.But whether they are bejewelled with diamante or made out of beautiful cotton fabrics, wearing or not wearing a face mask in shops has become the latest polarising debate on social media – with the reaction ranging from the humorous to downright outrage.It will be compulsory to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets in England from 24 July, with those who fail to follow the new rules facing a fine of up to £100.During a recent work trip to Mallorca, my first foreign excursion since the world hit self-destruct, I was confronted with the prospect of wearing a mask for long periods of time.

My mask went on the moment I stepped into Manchester airport and, bar a few short breaks to sip a drink and hurriedly eat a sandwich, it remained on for six hours until I reached my hotel.The following day, walking through the streets of Palma, popping into shops and getting on a bus, I once again donned my three-ply, ear-looped travel buddy, as it is mandatory to wear a mask on public transport and in stores on the Spanish island.But as temperatures hit 30C the mask got sweaty and, with no escape for the warm air, nausea set in. I instantly started to regret my mask choice, jealously eyeing up those who had obviously done their research. I began to suffer from mask envy.Next came the not-so-attractive steamy sunglasses as my mask flipped about, not quite fitting the bridge of my nose. After hours of wearing the elasticated loops my ears began to chafe, an unusual, but distinct, discomfort behind my lobes.Lessons were well and truly learned, and I will be armed with research before future mask purchases, as more countries globally make it mandatory to wear them in public spaces.Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. They have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries.According to guidance from the World Health Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.The Costa del Sol, where around 2.3 million Britons holiday every year, recently made it compulsory to wear masks in public at all times, in line with the other tourist hotspots of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera. Exceptions are made only for sunbathers on beaches and pools, when eating or drinking, while practising sport and while playing a wind instrument. However, in Catalonia tourists are still required to wear masks at the beach or by the pool.Across the border in France, the rules are slightly less stringent. While it is compulsory to wear face masks on public transport, it is up to inidual shop owners to ask their customers to wear face coverings. This, though, could be subject to change, with the French prime minister, Jean Castex, recently signalling that face mask use in enclosed public spaces was under consideration.Meanwhile, in Italy, although holidaymakers will not receive a fine for non-compliance, it is mandatory to use masks in enclosed public spaces. Flout it at your peril, as mask-less people will be removed from public transport.Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against the virus, followed by surgical grade masks, but they are costly and reserved for healthcare workers. Then there are the homemade reusable cloth versions and the single-use paper ones.Whatever you decide on, face masks are here to stay – for a while at least – so spend the next week choosing wisely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db482cc283adcd9f00acdcfc176aa66976e65e0f/0_195_5624_3375/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0256a0f60821786656f3bd9d85007bcb","title":"face coverings show us your homemade masks","story":"Shoppers in England will have to wear face masks from 24 July.

Many, such as Emmanuel Macron and Charles Michel, opted for a friendly elbow bump. Others offered polite bows.After a series of unsatisfactory video conferences, meeting in person was deemed essential if EU leaders are to bridge their differences on a €1.8tn (£1.6tn) financial settlement in a fiendishly complex negotiation that exposes profound differences on fiscal discipline, rule of law and the climate emergency. “The stakes couldn’t be higher,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president and architect of a €750bn coronavirus recovery proposal intended to help Europe’s economy through the deepest economic shock since the second world war. The leaders are also trying to finalise a deal on a seven-year, €1.074tn budget after talks failed in February.Having arrived under grey skies, Macron described the coming hours as “absolutely decisive”, adding: “Our European project is at stake.”The summit, which is slated for two days but could run into Sunday, is taking place under strict hygiene conditions, with extra cleaning and changes to the ventilation system to ensure fresh air at all times. Meeting in the largest room in the egg-shaped dome of the Europa building, each leader found a bottle of hand sanitiser and a sealed packet of clean headphones at their place.All took the advice to wear a mask on arrival, although Bulgaria’s prime minister, Boyko Borisov, allowed his to slip down his face, leaving his nose exposed. Luxembourg’s Xavier Bettel eschewed the pale blue pharmacy option for a pop-art mask reading “moien!” (morning, in Luxembourgish).Angela Merkel, the EU’s longest-serving leader, who is seen as a crucial broker in the talks, said she expected “very, very difficult negotiations”. But before getting down to business, gifts were exchanged. It was Merkel’s 66th birthday, and she was presented by Macron with a bottle of fine white bourgogne. Borisov gave her a traditional silver flask containing Bulgarian rose oil.Merkel posed for a photo with Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, also marking his birthday. She gave him a copy of a 17th-century map of Goa, a former Portuguese colony where Costa has family ties.Michel, the European council president, wished the pair a happy birthday and offered congratulations to the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, who got married on Wednesday. She had had to change plans three times when a general election, coronavirus and then this weekend’s summit got in the way.Rutte insists his government should have the power to veto coronavirus recovery grants, a demand deemed unacceptable by France, Spain, Italy and others. Among the frugal four, which also comprises Denmark, Sweden and Austria, “he is the only one sticking to unanimity,” an EU diplomat said. “If he is ready to move, you can discuss something.”At February’s EU budget summit, Rutte irritated Merkel and others by ostentatiously telling the press he had brought a book about Frédéric Chopin to pass the time. “No biographies this time,” Rutte told Dutch media on Friday. “It will be hard work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f070d69205d9846969c8b6dd86bb00a498614bcd/0_242_3184_1910/master/3184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88131cf719cbc639b732412ad64954d3","title":"dam busters dogs gravestone altered by raf","story":"Dog’s name was on headstone at base of 617 Squadron, which carried out wartime raidThe headstone of a grave of the Dambusters’ dog, whose name was a racial slur, has been altered.The 617 Squadron, based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, undertook a low-level night attack on German dams in 1943, probably the most famous raid in the history of the force.Wing Commander Guy Gibson used his dog’s name as a codeword to say the dam had been breached. The black labrador retriever died on the same night as the raid.Films about the Dambusters have either edited out the dog’s name or given him the moniker Trigger instead.A source at the RAF said the gravestone at Scampton would be stored in a safe location while the air historical branch considers the next steps. It is understood the RAF’s review of its historical assets is continuing and further changes may be made.The Conservative former minister Sir Edward Leigh, whose constituency includes Scampton, wrote to the RAF station commander saying: “Undoubtedly we are both more sensitive and more sensible today when it comes to the delicateness of racialist and derogatory terminology which had been used with unfortunate informality in the past.“It is perfectly understandable that this is a tricky matter to which there are no simple or easy solutions. I am, however, very fearful of our ability today to erase or rewrite history.“The past needs to be explained, taught about and learned from – not rewritten. Wing Commander Gibson’s dog was much loved by the Dambusters and was killed while he was on a raid risking his life to defend our country.”A spokesman for the RAF said: “As part of an ongoing review of its historical assets, the RAF have replaced the gravestone of Guy Gibson’s dog at RAF Scampton. The new gravestone tells the story of Guy Gibson’s dog, but its name has been removed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc8c86ed89994f6406fb538cb6b78de215d40002/536_167_3245_1947/master/3245.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5ffb29d99908f8eb18764a344270ac98","title":"former catalan president amassed huge fortune through judge says","story":"Jordi Pujol, his wife Marta Ferrusola, his seven children and 18 other iniduals linked to the family will be chargedA Spanish judge plans to charge the former Catalan president Jordi Pujol, along with his wife Marta Ferrusola, his seven children and 18 other iniduals linked to the family, with forming a criminal organisation that used its political influence to amass “a disproportionate fortune”.Pujol was the first democratically elected president of Catalonia after the end of the Franco dictatorship at the end of the 1970s, a position he held for 23 years, during which time his Convergència i Unió party dominated the Catalan political scene.In his 509-page ruling, judge José de la Mata of the Audiencia Nacional, the criminal court that deals with terrorism and organised crime, said: “For decades the Pujol Ferrusola family has used its highly privileged position in Catalan political, social and economic life to accumulate huge wealth through corrupt activities.”De la Mata said a seven-and-a-half year investigation had exposed the family as a criminal organisation involved in money laundering, tax fraud and false documentation. The judge said that some of this activity took place from 1980 to 2003, when Pujol was the Catalan president.The scandal first broke in 2014 when Pujol admitted that he had failed to declare funds held in Andorra, which he claimed derived from his inheritance, a claim the judge says is unsubstantiated.During his time as regional president, Pujol played the kingmaker in Madrid, wringing more concessions and greater political autonomy for Catalonia in return for supporting minority governments on both right and left.The scandal emerged just as the Catalan independence movement was hitting its stride and was largely ignored or even dismissed by some Catalans as a Madrid-based conspiracy. But following Pujol’s initial confession, investigators uncovered a series of corrupt operations and cash for favours, especially on the part of his eldest son, also called Jordi.While many in Catalonia will see the development as another conspiracy hatched by a hostile Spanish state, for much of the country it will be a welcome sign that the judiciary is clamping down on the sort of corruption that has been a hallmark of Spanish political life for the past 40 years.According to the judge, the family concealed payments through fake contracts and tax havens and used its political influence to ensure that, in exchange for money, companies were awarded lucrative public contracts.The judge claims the organisation was led by Pujol and his wife, “who describes herself as the mother superior of the congregation” while the other key player was her son Jordi, known within the clan as “the parish priest”.When Pujol confessed to the undeclared inheritance in 2014, fellow party member Josep Rull described him as “a thinker and a statesman” and “the man who led the recovery of self-government and who governed Catalonia as a nation, not a region”.Rull was jailed last October for 10-and-a-half years for his part in the illegal declaration of independence in 2017. From today, he and the eight other jailed Catalan politicians will be allowed out of prison on day release."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65db9aa3dcf73bdd26aff1a796e422caa1c11e24/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59463920bc3302a56fa78493fdef6cd0","title":"israel returns to partial lockdown with immediate weekend shutdown","story":"Government unveils measures after marathon emergency cabinet session as infections riseIsrael has reimposed some lockdown measures following a vigorous second surge in the number of coronavirus infections, putting in place stringent weekend shutdowns in which shops, hairdressers and attractions will be closed.The government announced the measures in the early hours of Friday morning, following a marathon emergency cabinet session called after daily infection rates climbed to close to 2,000.Gyms and fitness studios will also be closed at all times, while restaurants, which opened again in May, will return to takeaways and deliveries only. All indoor gatherings of 10 or more people will be banned.Changes start from this weekend, which in Israel begins on Friday afternoon, the eve of the Jewish Sabbath, and last until Sunday, the first working day of the week. Nurseries will remain open, although closures were being considered.Israel Radio reported that full lockdowns, with people again confined to their homes, might be imposed from next weekend, after parliamentary approval.During the cabinet meeting, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the government’s goal was to stop gatherings of people, but added that the new steps may not be “scientific”.Yair Lapid, the head of the opposition, criticised the partial lockdown, saying it was confusing and not based on evidence. “An entire country is trying to understand why decisions are made in the middle of the night without any data and isn’t able to,” he tweeted on Twitter on Friday.The country of 9 million was praised initially for a swift lockdown in March that was credited with reducing daily infections to single digits. However, officials and public health officials say the economy was reopened too hastily and without necessary steps taken to control the pandemic.With more than one in five Israelis unemployed, Netanyahu has faced mounting public anger over his handling of the crisis, with thousands of protesters holding frequent demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, some of which have been dispersed by police.The Israeli leader is also fighting three corruption allegations, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust – accusations he denies, dismissing them as part of a politically-motivated witch-hunt.Outside his Jerusalem residence on Thursday night, several hundred people banged drums and blew on horns, calling for Israel’s longest-serving leader to resign. Some wore masks with “crime minister” written on them.Noam Arnonovitch, 32, who lives in Tel Aviv, said he had been seeking employment for a few months while working part-time in bars.“I came because I think there’s something very deeply wrong with our political culture in Israel,” he said, complaining of what he said was destructive us-versus-them discourse from the government.“I think that now, because of the extremity of the situation we’ve reached, people are really fed up and we’re starting to feel it in our pockets, in our refrigerators, and in our general sense of security.”Another demonstrator, Aramit Lotem, said Netanyahu had painted any dissenting voices as those of traitors. “It’s not only the virus,” the 61-year-old Jerusalem resident said. “The virus is really a good opportunity for Netanyahu to manipulate our liberty.”At a nearby counter-demonstration of about a dozen people, one person said he had come to protest against “the anarchists”. He accused the anti-Netanyahu camp of staging violent demonstrations. “I believe that if you want to change the leader, it’s at a vote.”On Wednesday, Netanyahu had presented a 6bn shekel (£1.4bn) package, with payments of up to £175 for iniduals, rising to nearly £700 for families, arguing it would boost spending and “get the economy moving faster”.The plan, which needs cabinet approval, was swiftly rejected by senior officials, including government ministers, who said the money should instead be targeted at the poorest citizens. One prominent Israeli columnist, Ben Caspit, accused the leader of “handing out bribes to the masses” to placate nationwide discontent.However, other polls have shown his ruling Likud party remains the most popular in the country, even if slightly fewer people would vote for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7a413083a98840d41dd23c14e455c011131e6e/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1602ac9976aed41f09f4e93ee59d8e 700w","title":"coronavirus live news brazil cases near 2m as more countries re introduce restrictions","story":"Gatherings of more than 10 people banned US sets highest one-day total of new infections for pandemic so far Brazil cases pass 2mMillions of workers in the US have lost health insurance and faced salary cuts and unions say firms are not doing enough to take care of employees during the pandemic.

Fink said additional stimulus is critical for the recovery. With protests growing, economically punishing restrictions reimposed and surging coronavirus cases in Israel, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s poll numbers are sinking.After a late-night cabinet meeting, the government on Friday announced that stores, markets and various other public spaces would be closed on weekends. It said restaurants would be limited to takeaway services through the week, with a later statement specifying the measure would start from Tuesday. Netanyahu’s office said the premier wanted to avoid another “general lockdown” – a move that would likely infuriate a public battered by the pandemic.But it is clear that coronavirus stumbles by Netanyahu, a right-winger, have dented his support. After his government curbed flights and imposed lockdown measures in March, Israel briefly reduced its daily tally of newly confirmed cases to the single digits in early May, but in recent weeks new cases have regularly topped 1,000 per day. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties, whose support has been essential to keeping Netanyahu in power, have voiced frustration over the looming threat of renewed synagogue closures. Netanyahu met with ultra-Orthodox party leaders this week and said he wanted to ease their “distress,” while pledging to hold consultations before imposing any closures.

Please get in touch with me if you want to share any comments or news tips.Homebuilding in the US increased by the most in nearly four years amid reports of rising demand for housing in suburbs and rural areas as companies allow employees flexibility to work from home during the pandemic. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.169m units.Builders reported increased demand for single-family homes in lower density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro suburbs. The public health crisis has shifted office work from commercial business districts to homes, a trend that economists predict could become permanent.Following the earlier reports of partial and voluntary lockdown in Barcelona,  journalist Stephen Burgen reports on the response in the city.Meritxell Budó, the Catalan government spokeswoman, urged people not to travel to their second homes for the weekend. The measures mirror those recently introduced in L’Hospitalet, a a large satellite town on the southern edge of Barcelona, as well as in Lleida and the surrounding rural area in north-west Catalonia.Budó said “the pandemic is advancing without cease” and said people “have to follow all the measures taken by the regional government”. She called for “personal and collective commitment”. Strictly speaking the lockdown can only be advisory in the absence of a state of emergency, which can only be imposed by central government. The state of emergency was lifted on June 21.Furthermore, the recommendations are confusing and apparently contradictory. People are being asked to stay at home but bars and restaurants remain open, albeit with a limited capacity. Children’s summer schools are also allowed to stay open.The only absolute prohibition imposed is on meetings of more than 10 people in the street, but even this will have to be ratified by a judge.The measures have been introduced after the regional health department said that 1,293 new cases had been recorded in Catalonia in the past 24 hours, a figure similar to that recorded in March at the height of the pandemic. In the course of a week the number of cases in Barcelona has tripled.India has become the third country to record more than 1m coronavirus infections, following the US and Brazil, as it reported 34,956 new cases in the past 24 hours, taking the national total to 1,003,832, Peter Beaumont reports.Amid evidence that the disease was taking hold in poorer, rural areas less well-served by public healthcare, the latest tally prompted renewed concerns about the country’s ability to cope with rising infections.The figures have been released after a week in which authorities in India were forced to impose new lockdowns, including fresh restrictions on 128 million people in the state of Bihar, which came into force on Thursday.Read more here: Covid-19 cases in the France’s Brittany region, which is popular with tourists, have risen sharply in less than a week, according to government data. This is the latest indication that the virus is again gaining momentum in France.According to data released on today, the disease’s reproduction rate, known as the R0, in Brittany had risen from 0.92 to 2.62 between July 10 and July 14, Reuters reports. The number is one of several indicators authorities are watching when deciding on whether to reimpose tougher restrictions after ending the country’s lockdown in May.A reproduction rate of 2.62 means that each Covid-19 infected person is, on average, passing the disease on to between two and three other people. A rate of less than one is needed to gradually contain the disease.The government on Thursday accelerated plans to make it compulsory to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces amid concerns about renewed spikes of Covid-19, especially in areas in western and southern France that had been relatively spared during the height of the outbreak between March and May.Barcelona residents were urged to stay at home and to not gather in groups of more than 10 as regional authorities aim to curb a rise in coronavirus cases, without imposing a mandatory lockdown.We recommend that people don’t move around if it’s not absolutely necessary.” It is very important to respect these measures now, it’s the best way to avoid a lockdown.”Residents were urged to shop online and cultural and sports events will also be limited, Reuters reports.Barcelona, which is Spain’s second largest city with a population of 1.6 million people, has seen its number of coronavirus cases increase from last week.Spain reported the steepest daily jump in coronavirus infections in over two months on Thursday, with 580 new cases registered. Spain has been one of Europe’s hardest hit countries with more than 28,000 deaths in the pandemic. It emerged from a strict national lockdown on 21 June but since then more than 170 clusters have appeared, prompting regional authorities to impose a patchwork of local restrictions.Authorities in the Czech Republic have tightened restrictions in the north-east of the country after a spike in cases. Compulsory face coverings, limited restaurant opening hours and ordering checks on cross-border commuters have been reinstated.There have been 335 Covid-19 related deaths in the country but it has seen a new spike in infections in the past three weeks, mostly concentrated in the industrial Moravia-Silesia region bordering Poland and Slovakia.The Czech Republic has reported more than 100 new cases in seven out of the past 10 days, with a large number from the north-east following an outbreak in the state-owned OKD coalmines, Reuters reports.The national tally of new positive cases hit 305 on 28 June when the mine outbreak peaked. The mine suspended most operations earlier this month after criticism that it had acted too slowly.Health minister Adam Vojtěch tweeted that from today the local hygienic station will extend the currently valid measures in the Karviná region to the entire region. In the region, the obligation to wear veils indoors and on public transport is being introduced.Urumqi, the capital of China’s far western region of Xinjiang, reported five new coronavirus cases on Friday, after the report of an earlier case, its first in months. The new cases has led to hundreds of flights being cancelled.The city also reported eight new asymptomatic cases, the regional health commission said, taking Xinjiang’s tally to six infections and 11 asymptomatic patients.Subway services have also been suspended in Urumqi on Thursday.On Thursday, health authorities in Urumqi said a 24-year-old woman with symptoms such as a sore throat, fever and headaches, tested positive for the virus. Three people with whom she had close contact tested positive but did not show symptoms.Also on Thursday, the eastern province of Zhejiang reported an asymptomatic case involving a traveller from Xinjiang.The tally of mainland China’s confirmed infections was 83,622 by the end of Thursday, with the number of deaths remaining at 4,634. Another 104 asymptomatic patients were under observation.Beijing reported no new cases for an 11th consecutive day.This was still significantly below the 1,600 daily new cases the country logged at the peak of the pandemic.With the latest numbers and the recent increases of confirmed cases, you can clearly see that we are at the start of a second wave”However, Yves van Laethem, a spokesman for the Belgian health ministry, told Belgian broadcaster RTBF that the prospect of a second wave appeared to be localised to particular provinces for now. Speaking to Le Soir newspaper, virologist Marius Gilbert echoed this, adding that transmission rates remain relatively low.Health Minister Maggie de Block today called on Belgians to respect social distancing rules.Boris Johnson has unveiled the next steps in England’s coronavirus response, Simon Murphy reports.At a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister highlighted that local authorities will have new powers in their areas to enable the closure of specific premises, shut outdoor spaces and cancel events.In addition, new regulations will allow the government to intervene in local areas. He said: “Action for local councils will not always be sufficient, so next week we will publish draft regulations which clearly set out how central government can intervene more effectively at a local level.“Where justified by the evidence, ministers will be able to close whole sectors, or types of premises in an area or introduce local stay-at-home orders, prevent people entering or leaving defined areas, reduce the maximum size of gatherings beyond national rules or restrict transport systems serving local areas.” Johnson also said during the press conference he hopes for a “return to normality, possibly in time for Christmas”.

Photograph:  Domnick WalshOver 1,000 natterjack “toadlets”, Ireland’s only native toad, have been released into specially constructed ponds in west Kerry after being rescued and reared in captivity during the dry spell, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has confirmed.They had to be rescued earlier this year after the long period of dry weather dried up their ponds.Some 463 tadpoles were rescued by NPWS staff and brought to the Dingle aquarium where they were reared. A further 600 were reared in Fota Wildlife Park in Cork as part of a captive toadlet breeding programme there.The natterjack, an internationally endangered species, is found in Ireland only in southwest Kerry, primarily in the Maharees and Castlegregory areas where a golf course and sand dune system are some of its most important breeding grounds.The decline in farmland ponds has been identified as the main cause of natterjack toad decline across Europe.A pond construction scheme put in place by the NPWS in 2008 involving local farmers has seen around 100 ponds dug. Farmers are asked to maintain around the ponds under five-year contracts for which they are paid €1,000 a year.“We are trying to recreate the original range around Castlemaine Harbour,” said Dr Ferdia Marnell, amphibian expert with the NPWS, who heads up the programme put in place by field workers.Although one in five of the constructed ponds have become colonised, numbers of toads are still in decline, according to the most recent survey and the toad is on Ireland’s red data list of endangered species.Unlike the common toad, the natterjack crawls and runs rather than hops, burrow into sand dunes and have a distinctive yellow stripe down their back,according to ecologists with the NPWS."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"National Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recoveryAnalysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"A beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creatures"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: John ThysPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesAre we near the end of this seemingly endless crisis yet?The short and dispiriting answer is no, we are not even close to the end. There was definitely cause for optimism in the early part of the summer with Ireland seemingly moving through the first three phases of the exit from lockdown with comparative ease. All the talk was of the curve being successfully flattened while new cases declined and the numbers of lives claimed by Covid-19 each day fell significantly. But - as has we have seen in many countries across the world - this beast is not easily tamed and infection rates are on the rise again. The critical R number could be, by some estimates, dangerously close to 2. This has triggered loud alarm bells in the corridors of power and in hospital ICUs across the country which has led to many elements of phase 4 of the lockdown exit being pushed back.Can you remind me again what the R number is?The R-number is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus onto and according to Prof Philip Nolan, the chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) modelling group, it has likely risen to 1.4, but could be as high as 1.8. When the virus seemed to be on the wane the R-number was closer to 0.6. According to the current models, if the spread of the virus continues as it has done recently, the number of new cases could rise to more than 150 a day by August 10th. The State’s current “precarious position” has seen the Health Service Executive (HSE) warn that hospitals will not be able to cope if a second wave of coronavirus hits during the winter flu season.Why is the winter flu season so important?Because, traditionally, when flu is spreading widely, hospitals are under the most extreme pressure. As it stands, they are operating at an 80 per cent capacity, with the 20 per cent being kept in reserve to allow for any Covid-surge that may happen. During the winter months, many hospitals see their capacity exceed 100 per cent and if that coincides with a second wave - or a continuation of the first wave - of coronavirus, we are going to be in serious trouble.That is all very worrying isn’t it?Everything is very worrying these days but it is important to stress at this point that Ireland has not seen a major spike in infection rates and the county’s 14-day incidence of the virus remains among the lowest in Europe, according to the latest country data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. We are not experiencing a second wave of the virus.What is the Covid toll as it stands?Official tallies suggest that - at the time of writing (10:20am on Friday July 17th) it has claimed the lives of 1,749 while 25,698 people have been confirmed as having had the illness.What is behind the increased number of cases in recent weeks?Some class of increase was always going to be inevitable as the country started to reopen and people started going about their daily lives and interacting more with each other. However, there have been clusters arising out of house parties in recent days while about 20 per cent of new cases are connected to international travel, either imported cases or people travelling here from elsewhere and passing the disease on.International travel? I thought we were being told to stay at home?We are. But that doesn’t mean the country has been hermetically sealed. Flights to and from Europe and the US are still taking off and landing as they have done throughout the crisis.The US? But isn’t the disease rampant there?It is certainly a long way from being brought under control in that part of the world and an increase in the number of flights to and from the US in recent weeks has been a cause for concern in many quarters, not least because US travellers are not allowed come to other countries in the EU.Why are they allowed come here so?Because Ireland not in the Schengen Area and as a result it is not part of that wider EU ban. It is, however, important to point out that just because planes are travelling to and from the US, it does not mean there is a significant number of people on those planes.What do you mean by that?Aer Lingus have three flights to the US daily, United Airlines have four a week and American Airlines have three. But the reality is that only a handful of people are on any of those flights. In recent days one flight crossed the Atlantic ferrying eight passengers to Ireland.But why would an airline fly a plane with so few passengers?Freight is one simple answer to that question. There is a significant cargo business that needs to be catered for while it is also important to keep the routes open to allow for essential journeys . There are certainly some tourists from the US and from other problematic countries travelling to Ireland but the numbers are not thought to be significant, at least not at this stage.But don’t people who come here from overseas have to quarantine?No, not really. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil this week that the use of the word “quarantine” in this context was wrong. What people have to do is self-isolate, apparently.And do new arrivals “self isolate”?Well, some do and some don’t an answer which is not much use to anyone we know.So, what’s the deal with travel, then?The advice against unnecessary travel overseas has been extended until the middle of August but the Government still plans to publish a “green list” of countries with similar levels of infection rates that people can travel to on Monday.What? That sounds sort of confusing. Have they not heard of the concept of mixed messaging?Indeed it is confusing. On Monday we will get a list of countries we can travel to with relative safety but we will also be told not to go to those countries or indeed any other countries unless it is essential.And what countries will be on the green list?Too early to say, although you can expect to see countries with a broadly similar infection rate to Ireland’s on the list. Varadkar said the green list would include countries where “you are no more likely to get the virus there than here”. Don’t expect too many countries to feature and even if they do feature you’re not supposed to go to them anyway so it doesn’t really matter.Um, what is the point of the green list then?What indeed. According to the Tánaiste, if a country makes it onto the green list for those travelling “between Ireland and a country on the A-list or the green list there’ll be no restrictions, and that’s based on science, based on the fact that if you’re travelling to one of those countries you’re no more likely to get the virus there than a weekend in Dublin or weekend in Killarney. ”Oh, and wasn’t there talk of a voucher so we could holiday at home?Yeah, that is not going to happen.Anything else about overseas visits and visitors?Well, “tighter controls” are also expected to be implemented on passengers travelling between countries not on the “green list” - possibly random testing for Covid-19. At present, arrivals in Ireland only have to fill in a passenger locator form and agree to self-isolate for a fortnight.And the pubs aren’t opening as planned?No. Pubs that don’t serve food were supposed to be reopening on Monday July 20th but that has now been pushed back until August 10th as health officials raised concerns about an increase in Covid-19 infections. The move was described as a kick in the teeth by publicans.And who is going to police that particular recommendation?At a guess, no-one. The idea that the Garda would have the resources or the inclination to call to someone’s house if they saw some class of gathering taking place and start checking numbers and names and addresses seems outlandish.Can you tell me what is happening with masks?Wearing face masks on public transport is already mandatory and is to become mandatory in indoor spaces such as shops and shopping centres.But do they work?When it comes to something like Covid-19 giving a definitive answer to almost anything is a challenge but we do know that masks do not completely protect people from getting the virus. Masks most likely do, however, push transmission down to controllable levels.Do we have any evidence to back that up?We do. According to one US study, when 80 per cent of a closed population wear a mask, infection rates statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections compared to “a live-virus population” where no masks were worn. Then there is the University of Edinburgh study which found masks can limit how far exhaled breath travels out by up to 90 per cent. There is also a third study which found the daily growth rate of infections fell by 40 per cent after mask use was made compulsory in the German city of Jena. There are more studies. A lot more. The bottom line is wearing a mask does little harm to anyone - save for those who medically can not wear a mask - and have the potential to do a whole lot of good.So, is August 10th as the last exit from lockdown now definitive?Not even remotely. The final phase of the Government’s roadmap to unlock the Irish economy from coronavirus restrictions may be pushed out beyond August 10th. The Tánaiste told the Dáil on Wednesday that pubs may remain closed beyond that date. He said pubs, nightclubs and other venues will open “no sooner than 10th August. We are not saying they will open on 10th August.” And he stressed that it depends “on how the virus behaves” and the numbers of coronavirus cases which were rising.Singing?Yes, it emerged on Thursday that a cluster of cases had recently arisen from a microphone used for karaoke at a house party in Co Derry Singing it was one of the easiest ways to spread the virus because of the spray of droplets, Dr De Gascun said.What is happening with schools, the Leaving Cert, university and all the rest?To say there is still uncertainty about what will happen to Ireland’s student body come September is an understatement up there with “Covid is a nasty dose all the same”. The plan as it stands is to reopen schools in September as normal and guidelines on how that will happen will be published in the coming days. More than 60,000 Leaving Cert students will this year receive their grades several weeks later than normal on September 7th with CAO offers for college places issued four days later on September 11th, which means many students may not start their third-level courses until October.And what is happening on the economic front?Next week the Government will publish the snappily-named July Stimulus. It is the Government’s centrepiece policy to try to re-stoke the economy after four months of near standstill during the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Social Protection said on Monday that the numbers receiving the pandemic unemployment payment had now reduced by 42 per cent, or by more than 250,000 since the peak of nearly 600,000 in early May. It said that 345,000 people would receive the Covid-19 unemployment payment this week, a drop of 67,300 on last week.What’s the story with the wage subsidy scheme?Mr Varadkar has said continuing the wage subsidy scheme, and commercial rates waiver, until the end of 2020 will be central considerations of the July Stimulus. Mr Varadkar has also said he will consider extending the wage subsidy scheme - which is due to come to an end on October 31st - to seasonal workers and others who might not have been on the payroll last February. He also indicated a reboot of the already-operational restart grant for businesses.Something big is happening in Brussels this weekend?Yes, EU leaders are meeting to discuss a €750 billion recovery plan to fight the worst recession in a century. The leaders will also discuss the EU’s next seven-year budget. A group of so-called frugal states led by the Netherlands want cut to the €750 billion and believe the money should be distributed as loans. The European Commission has proposed borrowing on financial markets to raise the money for the fund, which would then largely be distributed to member states in grants that would not need to be directly repaid.What is happening with Covid in other parts of the world?The crisis is getting worse in many parts of the world and even in places which were thought to have largely brought the pandemic under control, there are spikes still happening. On Thursday the US reported a record 77,300 new coronavirus cases , the highest one-day total for the pandemic so far. It is by far the worst-affected country worldwide with almost 3.6 million confirmed infections and 138,358 fatalities. Brazil is next highest with 2,012,151 cases and 76,688 deaths. The state of Victoria in Australia has just reported a record 428 new cases, 10 days in to a lockdown of Melbourne while the neighbouring state of New South Wales has tightened restrictions on pubs, restaurants and gatherings. The residents of three districts in a Barcelona suburb have been told they must stay indoors amid a resurgence in cases while Lerida in the north east of Catalonia, which is home to 160,000 people, is now in lockdown after a surge in new infections.And how are we doing with the vaccine?The global race to develop a vaccine is continuing apace with several candidates leading the charge. Dr Anthony Fauci, of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said one could be ready at the end of the year, although others have said that may be optimistic.Moderna’s potential Covid-19 vaccine produced immune responses in patients in the early stage trial, according to results published in a peer-reviewed journal this week. The US biotech company’s vaccine candidate produced antibodies in all 45 participants in the first cohort of the phase one trial run by the National Institutes of Health, while the paper said there were no safety problems that could curtail further trials.The trial showed that 15 days after the first dose, all participants had produced antibodies. After 57 days, the participants had on average more antibodies than a group of 38 recovered patients, whose symptoms were mainly mild or moderate. There are other companies not far behind but the next stage will be wider trials and then wider ones. And only then will vaccines be produced after which the scramble to get the doses will start.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4306286.1594913398!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"face masks all you need to know about where when and why you need one","story":"Researchers in UCD and the Mater hospital are looking into the benefits of face masks for the public and in operating theatres.  Video: UCD Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA mask protects the public from the wearer who might not know they are contagious.Ireland got its response to Covid-19 largely right. Case figures and deaths don’t lie. But we got some things wrong – notably on face masks. In spite of remarkable progress, there are no widely available treatments and no immediate prospect of an effective vaccine. Covid-19 still poses the same risk as it did during the pandemic’s first days . The threat of a second wave lurks ever present.That is why making the wearing of face masks compulsory is essential. Ireland is coming late to this approach after much dithering and too much confused messaging.Where are we now on face masks?Wearing face masks on public transport is already mandatory and is to become mandatory in indoor spaces such as shops. We are shifting from “should” wear them to “must” wear them. And because of the extent of health threat, this goes beyond “basic good manners” or respiratory etiquette.The hard lessons from having to implement actions in a nightmarish scenario of constantly emerging knowledge about an insidious global threat don’t need to be raked over. Scaling up effective actions knowing what we do now needs to be the focus.Likewise, the message has to be right browbeating people into wearing them won’t work. We may, however, be at a tipping point. This week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin was out and about wearing a face mask. Many more people have their face covered on public transport – one media report suggested nine out of 10 people on Dublin’s Luas were wearing masks.What’s the latest evidence for wearing face masks?There is no study of scale providing definitive proof but science is about weighing up probability and evaluating risk.A UK study found population-wide face mask use could push transmission down to controllable levels, and prevent further Covid waves when combined with minor lockdowns.A US study found if 80 per cent of a closed population were to don a mask, infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections compared to “a live-virus population” in which no one wore masks. Emerging evidence prompted the World Health Organization to strengthen advice in their favour.A University of Edinburgh study recently found masks can limit how far exhaled breath travels out by up to 90 per cent, while another study found the daily growth rate of infections fell by 40 per cent after mask use was made compulsory in the German city of Jena. Many are wearing masks, so why are we seeing rising cases?The capricious nature of Covid-19 knows no bounds. It’s clear outdoor transmission is a minimal risk, the big challenge is stopping transmission in indoor settings, where iniduals are in close contact with limited ventilation for a prolonged period of time.Compounding this, according to Prof Devi Sridhar of the University of Edinburgh, is the role presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can play in spreading the disease – where an infected person spreads the virus before they develop symptoms themselves, or where they never develop symptoms.“Relying only on those with symptoms of coronavirus to self-isolate is not enough to stop transmission given the role that these silent carriers play in its spread,” she wrote in the .Covid-19 exploits those opportunities for infection in confined spaces. Washing hands properly before and after going to such places remains a critical action – wearing face masks while in that zone of potential spread is just as important.So what is the best advice?Face masks do not need to be worn in the open air or while driving a car but should be worn routinely where physical distancing is not possible. A mask protects the public from the wearer who might not know they are contagious.Medical-grade masks are the most effective barrier. Evidence on the protective value of single-use paper masks or reusable cloth coverings is less clear, but still suggests they can contribute to reducing transmission. For those over 60, whose immune system is weakening coinciding with ageing, and those with underlying conditions, the case is clear-cut. Moreover, they should wear medical-grade masks.What about indications of reckless socialising?Reinforcing regulations on mandatory wearing of face masks will soon be in place. Then it’s down to enforcement lack of implementation will quickly undermine credibility. Such measures are justified, especially where inadequate precautions are being taken. Given clusters are increasing around the country – and in spite of much good work curtailing Covid-19 – it suggests wearing a mask has been a matter of inidual choice for too long.Is there an outstanding messaging issue?A perception of invulnerability among young people persists. This necessitates a new approach to messaging, underpinned by great clarity. It should embrace wearing masks handwashing and getting tested quickly if showing signs of Covid-19.Wearing a mask is one of the most important defences in keeping Covid-19 at bay. Widespread adoption will enable further opening up of society and travel between countries with similarly low levels of infection to Ireland. That should be part of messaging too, ie the rewards.The social norm has to be wearing a mask, while accepting some people cannot wear one. We are not there yet. It’s a small price to pay for getting closer to normality – and pushing back that second wave.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Plan for

Photograph: Jack GuezAFP via Getty ImagesWith Israel struggling to contain a second coronavirus wave, the government has introduced a weekend lockdown and tightened restrictions in an attempt to bring down the rising daily infection rate, which is now close to 2,000.With angry demonstrations and polls showing the public was losing faith in the government’s response to both the pandemic and the deepening economic crisis, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu also announced a controversial cash handout for every Israeli family in an effort to stimulate economic activity.Beaches, malls and stores were ordered to close on weekends, which in Israel falls on Friday and Saturday.The new weekday restrictions included limiting restaurants to takeaways and imposing a 50 per cent capacity on government offices. Pools, museums, exhibition spaces, and tourism and holiday venues were also shuttered.Angry restaurant owners said they would defy the law and remain open this weekend rather than throw away all the food they had just bought ahead of the busiest two days of the week.Mr Netanyahu reacted angrily when ministers spoke out against a plan to close summer schools and kindergartens.“What, are you blind? We are heading toward a full lockdown,” he warned.Mr Netanyahu prided himself on Israel’s successful response to the initial outbreak of coronavirus, saying other countries were following its example. By late May designated hospital coronavirus wards were closed and economic restrictions were eased as he told Israelis “go enjoy yourselves”.But the lifting of the restrictions is now seen as having been too rapid and Israel is now in the midst of the second wave.Naftali Bennett, leader of the right-wing opposition Yamina, criticised the new restrictions. “Prime minister, have you gone mad? Deciding to impose a broad lockdown is out of touch, illogical and destructive. Why are you ruining peoples’ livelihood?” he asked.Growing criticism“The government has gone off the rails and it has lost the public’s trust,” said opposition leader Yair Lapid.Knesset member Ofer Cassif from the opposition Joint List linked the weekend lockdown to polls showing growing criticism of Mr Netanyahu and large protests that took place recently in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.The feeling that the government is disconnected from the distress caused by mounting unemployment was amplified when Tzahi Hanegbi, a minister from Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party, described reports of citizens going hungry as “bullshit”.On Wednesday Mr Netanyahu, in what looked like a panicked response to quell the growing resentment, announced that each family or adult would receive a grant of between 750 and 3,000 shekels (€190-€760).“We need to get the economy moving and so we are giving out this money. People are sitting at home and not spending and we want to encourage consumption,” he said.But the move, which was opposed by treasury officials, seemed to go against Mr Netanyahu’s staunchly capitalist, free market beliefs.Critics said the plan failed to differentiate between the affluent and those who are truly struggling. Many who said they didn’t need the handout promised to donate the money to people hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302587.1594542601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government announces 700m for britain eu border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December. Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

The sword used during the investiture was that of the Queen\u0027s father, George VI.Capt Sir Tom said before the event that he could never have imagined this would happen and that it would be the most special of days when he finally meets the Queen.I\u0027m absolutely overwhelmed by that, he told reporters as he departed his home for Windsor Castle. It isn\u0027t everybody that gets the chance to see the Queen, is it? It\u0027s going to be absolutely marvellous for me.If I kneel down I\u0027ll never get up again, he quipped.The ceremony took place outdoors at Windsor Castle, where the Queen has been in self-isolation with Prince Philip since March 19.It was staged in the quadrangle at the castle, where a military ceremony was held to mark the Queen\u0027s official birthday back in June.Both the Queen and Capt Sir Tom have been credited with providing a much-needed boost to national morale during the lockdown, becoming heroes of the pandemic through the respective reassurance and inspiration that they offered to the public.The Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote on social media after the ceremony: Congratulations to ⁦Captain Tom Moore⁩ on receiving your Knighthood.Capt Sir Tom Moore\u0027s knighthood is unusual in that it was announced inidually by the Prime Minister outside of the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours and the New Year\u0027s Honours.The knighthood also comes at a time when the royal investitures have generally been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Boris Johnson made a special nomination for the Army officer to be knighted on May 19, and said that he had provided the country with a beacon of light.The knighthood was approved by the Queen, and formally announced on May 20.On announcing the conferment of the honour, Mr Johnson described Capt Sir Tom Moore as a true national treasure who embodied the national solidarity that has grown throughout this crisis.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: On occasion, the Queen invests iniduals privately during audiences.Captain Sir Tom and his family were hopeful the investiture could take place in a timely fashion and we are pleased it has been possible on this occasion.Capt Sir Tom\u0027s daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore told BBC Breakfast this morning: It is just the most sensational day - of all the things Tom has been honoured by, this is just truly the absolute icing on the cake.Capt Sir Tom has received a knighthood after raising a total of £32.7 million for NHS charities via a Just Giving page at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.On April 6, two weeks into Britain\u0027s lockdown, he began to walk laps around his garden in aid of NHS Charities Together, and initially hoped to raise £1,000 in funds by the time he turned 100.He soon became a much-loved household name, with his fundraising page receiving more than 1.5 million indvidual donations and extensive coverage of his extraordinary life story.Born in Keighley, West Yorkshire on April 30 1920, Captain Tom completed a civil engineering apprenticeship before joining the Army, and was enlisted into the eighth battalion of the Duke of Wellington\u0027s Regiment (8 DWR).This was an infantry unit that was converted to operate Churchill tanks as part of the Royal Armoured Corps. In 1940, Sir Capt Tom was selected for officer training and rose to the rank of captain, going on to receive a promotion to 9 DWR in India.He then served and fought in the Arakan, west Burma, which has since been renamed Rakhine State. Post-war, he returned to the UK and started work as an instructor at the Armoured Fighting Vehicle School in Dorset.As the nation came together to honour its war heroes on May 8, the 75th anniversary of VE Day, Captain Sir Tom Moore reminisced about how his troops were under fire constantly and there was an element of discomfort during the Second World War.He also reminisced about hearing the Forces\u0027 Sweetheart Dame Vera Lynn, who in June passed away aged 103, serenading him and other soldiers.Captain Tom\u0027s fundraising total passed £30 million on April 30 - the day of his 100th birthday - and by the end of the charity campaign he had become a much-loved household name after extensive coverage and public tributes.A special flypast was held for Captain Tom\u0027s 100th birthday with two RAF planes, a Hurricane and a Spitfire, which took place over his village in Bedfordshire.The Royal Family confirmed that the Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire, the Queen\u0027s representative in the county, had also delivered in person a birthday card from the monarch to Captain Tom.Well-wishers included the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who told Captain Tom in a video message: “Your heroic efforts have lifted the spirits of the entire nation.You’ve created a channel to enable millions to say a heartfelt thank you to the remarkable men and women in our NHS who are doing the most astounding job.Mr Johnson added that he had become a point of light in all our lives, and praised his service to others.In recognition of his work, Captain Tom has also been made an honorary colonel by the Ministry of Defence, received the Freedom of the City of London, and even been made an honorary member of the England cricket team in acknowledgement of his favourite sport.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"many ants flying across england picked radar met office has","story":"So many ants are flying across England that they are being picked up on radar, the Met Office had revealed.Meteorologists were baffled when sensors in the South East picked up what seemed to be rain, but people in London, Kent and Sussex were enjoying a dry and cloudless day.Examining the shape of the \u0027droplets\u0027, which were picked up by radar, they found that they appeared to be insect-shaped.They then investigated on social media, to see if anyone in the local area was posting about an insect swam, and found that hundreds of people were complaining about hordes of flying ants.In mid-July, ants grow wings and fly high in the air, swarming together in the sky to mate. This causes a nuisance for those trying to enjoy a fine day outside, as they are prone to gathering in the sky and landing in drinks and on books and surfaces. They are often spotted by sunbathers as they prefer to mute in hot, dry and humid weather. This annual phenomenon is referred to as \u0027flying ant day\u0027.While many complained this year, BBC presenter Chris Packham rebuked those who besmirched the insects. He reminded his followers they are harmless and ecologically important. The ants provide an important food source for birds in the summer, and sometimes colonies of as many as 15,000 can be in the air at the same time.This years swarms of ants appear to have come thick and fast, as the Met Office have had small \u0027rain\u0027 alerts in dry parts of the country all week, and then a major alert in the South East on Friday.A spokesperson for the Met Office told The : It’s an annual event where they come out of the ground and fly into the air at the middle of July, it’s when they do their mating.“When our radar is detecting rain we send a beam down, it hits the droplet and sends the beam back. When it was sending the signal this morning our rain gauges were dry, there were no clouds in the sky, it was sunny. So it was hitting something else in the sky and sending a signal back.He explained that they had to trawl Twitter to find an answer, adding :We looked into what it was, looked into reports on social media where people were reporting flying ants and sending pictures and videos. We can also look at the shape of the object in the sky and they were coming back as not raindrop shapes, they were longer and more insect shaped.We could say that they were insects but couldn\u0027t say they were flying ants until we saw the information on social media.”This phenomenon has happened in previous years, and sometimes the swarms become so significant they can be seen from space.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle blames deterioration close relationship father","story":"The Duchess of Sussex has laid bare her financial dealings with her estranged father in the latest round of court documents, as she blames the deterioration of their “very close relationship” on the tabloid media.The Duchess, in new court papers filed by her lawyers, said she and Thomas Markle “had a very close fatherdaughter relationship throughout her childhood and remained close until he was targeted three years ago by intrusive UK tabloid media”.She is now suing the Mail on Sunday over publication of part of her handwritten letter to him, following the Royal Wedding he did not attend.In paperwork submitted to the High Court, the Duchess answers new questions about an “imputation” that she “failed to provide any or any real financial support for her father”, which she has said is false.It includes revelations previously included only in a private letter, claiming Mr Markle’s medical bills were offset by the “significant payments” he received for media interviews, which “would appear to exceed and offset the excess medical cost of roughly $2,500”.The disclosures are intended to counter claims that the Duchess has not provided financial support for her father.Instead, she said, she has offered “voluntary financial contributions” since she got a job, noting:  “The Claimant’s father gave occasional financial support to the Claimant, just as she provided reciprocal financial support to him once she began earning.”The details of the Markle family finances are the latest in an ongoing series of legal disclosures relating to the High Court case, which will rule on whether the Mail on Sunday breached the Duchess’s privacy, copyright or data protection.The existence of the letter, given to the newspaper by Mr Markle, first came to public attention in US celebrity magazine People, after five friends of the Duchess gave an interview intended to tell her side of the story.The Duchess has claimed she knew nothing of the article ahead of publication.In papers made public today, she said: “The Claimant realised Friends A, B and C had given anonymous interviews to People magazine upon learning that the article had been published.“Her belief that they had been involved was confirmed during phone calls via FaceTime on the day of publication and the following day.“The Claimant learnt Friend D was one of the anonymous sources for the People magazine article on or around 19 February 2019 when the two of them met in person.“She subsequently learnt of Friend E’s involvement a few days later during a celebration with friends to mark the forthcoming birth of her son. This discussion also took place in person.“All of these conversations took place post publication.” A source close to the Sussexes said the paperwork was a response to a fourth request for further information from Associated Newspapers.In reply to questions about the financial support provided by the Duchess to her father, lawyers said “the requests are gratuitous and a further violation and intrusion of privacy of both the Claimant and her father”.They go on to expand on the father-daughter relationship, admitting it has “never been denied that the Claimant’s father supported her throughout her childhood and as a young adult”.While the young Meghan Markle was at college, they said, her father did not “pay for all” tuition fees, with her mother also contributing, along with a scholarship and “work-study programme whereby income she made from working on campus after class was applied directly to supplement and lower her tuition costs”.While Mr Markle took out a loan from Northwestern University for tuition costs for his daughter, his daughter “began making voluntary financial contributions to her father” once she started earning to given “personal financial support”.As she started out as an actress, it is claimed, the Duchess “always maintained full-time jobs while auditioning, both as a professional calligrapher as well as working in a restaurant”.“The Claimant’s father gave occasional financial support to the Claimant, just as she provided reciprocal financial support to him once she began earning,” say her lawyers.Mr Markle made a “personal offer to contribute financially to her first wedding”, but “no request for any such contribution was made by the Claimant - not for $20,000 or any other amount”.Adding the Duchess had provided “substantial financial support to her father from January 2014”, lawyers confirm she has not offered any further funding since May 2018, when father and daughter ceased contact.After he received medical treatment ahead of the Royal Wedding, when he was admitted to hospital with heart problems, Mr Markle could have paid his costs with the fees he received for his media interview, papers suggest.“Medical documents within the Defendant’s possession, which were shared in the private reply from Mr Markle to the Claimant, clearly state the medical costs covered by insurance (exceeding six figures) and the nominal co-payment Mr Markle paid of roughly $2,500,” they state.“Within the correspondence Mr Markle notes the significant payments he received for interviews and quotes provided to UK tabloids and commentators, which would appear to exceed and offset the excess medical cost of roughly $2,500.”The Duchess is suing for undisclosed damages on the grounds of breach of privacy, copyright and data protection.No date has yet been set for the trial, which is expected to go ahead in 2021.Earlier this year, she lost the first strike-out hearing, in which Mr Justice Warby ruled her lawyers would not be allowed to argue in court that the newspaper acted dishonestly, “stirred up” issues with her father, and had an “agenda” against her.Associated Newspapers have wholly denied all claims against them, particularly the suggestion that the letter was edited in any meaningful way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz us statereimposed stay at home order","story":"In the week that Downing Street tightened its rules on face masks, it\u0027s time test your knowledge on the last seven days of current affairs. While the British government has been revising its own Covid-19 regulations, which US state reimposed its original \u0027stay-at-home\u0027 order this week after a surge of Covid-19 cases?In the world of sport, it was announced that Clive Tyldesley will be replaced as ITV\u0027s lead football commentator, but who will replace him? If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters closely you will have come across all of the answers to this week\u0027s quiz.

As a result, prior to our work, wireless vision has not been possible for small robots or insects.”The camera weighs about 250 milligrams, which is about one-tenth the weight of a playing card, and was placed on the back of two beetles: a death-feigning beetle and a Pinacate beetle.It transmits images at one to five frames per second and sits on a mechanical arm that can rotate 60 degrees.Using this mechanism, researchers can get a high-resolution, panoramic shot of the beetle’s environment.The challenging in developing the cameras was not image quality or weight, but battery life.Smartphone cameras, while small, require batteries too big to be carried around by insects. As such, the researchers had to use a tiny, low-power black and white camera which moves when a high voltage is applied to it.During social distancing could these Japanese robots be the answer?They turn their heads to steer where they want to see with extra clarity, such as for chasing prey or a mate. This saves power over having high resolution over their entire visual field.”The benefit of using this method is that the researchers can track an object without having to expend excess energy moving the whole robot.The camera system was also used to design what the University of Washington say is the “world’s smallest terrestrial, power-autonomous robot with wireless vision”.It uses vibrations to move, and uses as much power as a Bluetooth radio. It can move at a rate of two to three centimetres per second – apparently faster than any other tiny robot which uses vibrations to move - and has a battery life of 90 minutes.These cameras could be used to explore previously-unreachable environments and, in the future, could potentially be solar-powered.“This is the first time that we’ve had a first-person view from the back of a beetle while it’s walking around. There are so many questions you could explore, such as how does the beetle respond to different stimuli that it sees in the environment?” Vikram Iyer, a electrical and computer engineering doctoral student who also authored the research, said.“Also, insects can traverse rocky environments, which is really challenging for robots to do at this scale.

Yesterday, it was announced that two of Manchester’s most popular music venues, The Deaf Institute and Gorilla would be closing their doors for good.A series of UK drive-in concerts organised by Live Nation was recently cancelled amid concerns over local lockdown restrictions. The acts scheduled to perform included The Streets, Kaiser Chiefs and Dizzee Rascal.On the podcast, Geiger warned: “The next six months may be more painful than the last six months, and maybe the next six months after that are even more so.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus infection rate in England is five-times greater than that of Scotland’s, the latest data has revealed.Since mid-May, both countries have seen new daily coronavirus cases reduce significantly, though Scotland’s handling of the virus appears to have been far more effective.At their peak, both nations recorded a similar amount of new cases per day, with England recording around 73 new cases per million people compared to Scotland’s 63 infections per million people.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut while Scotland’s rate of new Covid-19 cases has fallen consistently below two per million since late June, England’s is yet to drop below seven per million.The latest figures, taken from Public Health England and Public Health Scotland, come after Nicola Sturgeon said she would “not shy away” from imposing quarantine restrictions on visitors from England.Scotland\u0027s more rapidly declining number of new daily coronavirus cases means that the difference between the two nation\u0027s infection rates has grown wider.Since mid May, England\u0027s infection rate compared to Scotland\u0027s rose from around 1.4-times greater, to more than 7-times greater by mid July. It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can reach temperatures of more than a million degrees Celsius.That is 300 times greater than the surface of the star, which is a comparatively chilly 5,500 degrees Celsius.Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that heat the corona are still not fully understood, but such discoveries are vital in the study of solar physics.It is possible the nanoflares could be the key to unlocking this mystery.NASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeYannis Zouganelis, Solar Orbiter deputy project scientist at ESA, said in a statement: “It’s obviously way too early to tell, but we hope that by connecting these observations with measurements from our other instruments that ‘feel’ the solar wind as it passes the spacecraft, we will eventually be able to answer some of these mysteries.”“We are all really excited about these first images – but this is just the beginning,” said Daniel Muller, ESA’s Solar Orbiter project scientist. “Solar Orbiter has started a grand tour of the inner solar system, and will get much closer to the Sun within less than two years. Ultimately, it will get as close as 42 million km, which is almost a quarter of the distance from Sun to Earth.”The temperatures of the campfires will be tracked using a tool called the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (Spice), which takes images using ultraviolet light.“Spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnostic of fundamental processes in hot plasmas. Each spectral line gives us a piece of the puzzle – combining information from all lines reveals the amazing complexity of the atmosphere,” said Dr Andrzej Fludra, the Spice Instrument Consortium lead.The Solar Orbiter has ten sensors: six to monitor the Sun and its surroundings, and four to monitor the environment around the ship itself.These include the Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyser, which measures heavy charged atoms of carbon, oxygen, silicon, and iron in the solar winds from the Sun’s inner heliosphere. By comparing the data between the sensors, scientists will also be able to better understand how solar winds are generated. Solar winds are charged particles sent from the Sun that can affect the entire solar system.“Already our data are revealing shock waves, coronal mass ejections, phenomena called ‘switchbacks’ and fine-scale waves in the magnetic field that we are only able to see thanks to the extreme sensitivity of our instrument,” said Professor Tim Horbury from Imperial College London.Nasa delays trip to Mars after rocket problemNASA shares time lapse footage of the sun over a decadeNasa asks for ideas for toilets for astronauts to use on the MoonNasa plans to fly a helicopter on MarsOn occasion, the Sun pushes out a great number of particles into space. These are called “coronal mass ejections” and, when they hit the Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause a huge surge of electrical current.On Earth, these events can disrupt and damage satellites, affecting people’s mobile phones, GPS signals, and electricity networks.The largest one to hit the Earth happened in 1859 and caused telegraph wires to short out, sparking fires. If the same event happened today, it could potentially cause continent-wide blackouts and severely damage the electrical grid.Such damage could take months or years to repair, at a cost of up to £300bn to the UK economy.The Solar Orbiter itself was part of a combined effort by many countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as Nasa in the United States.It was built in the UK by Airbus Defence and Space, and launched from Nasa’s Cape Canaveral site in Florida on 10 February.The Solar Orbiter will eventually get closer to the Sun than the planet Mercury, the solar system’s closest planet to the Sun.Gravitational forces from Venus and Earth will be used to direct the craft. By November 2021, it is expected to be in operational orbit.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism is much in evidence. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scientists from Oxford University point to evidence that seasonal coronaviruses may have provided people with some degree of immunity and other may be more naturally resistant to infection.Fears that a second wave of Covid-19 may arrive in the winter and cripple the NHS have been raised, with scientists urging ministers and health chiefs to plan now to get the UK ready for the winter. Experts said a major expansion of the test and trace system will be needed, as well as a roll-out of a major flu vaccination scheme and a nationwide disease surveillance system.On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a partial relaxation of lockdown restrictions imposed in the city of Leicester. The city’s mayor has criticised the government for taking a “sledgehammer approach” to the lockdown, which he said should only be imposed on 10 per cent of the city where infection rates are higher.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Peter Soulsby said he was not surprised but was “bitterly disappointed” by the announcement and accused the government of making a “party political” decision.New outbreaks in Yorkshire spark ‘growing concern’Government\u0027s \u0027work from home\u0027 advice to be relaxed from 1 AugustStudy: UK population may have high level of immunity to avoid second wave of Covid-19Leicester mayor \u0027bitterly disappointed\u0027 by lockdown extensionPM to announce additional\u0026nbsp£3bn funding for NHSA White House document has revealed 18 states are in the coronavirus “red zone” as the country records its highest single-day jump in new cases.Concern has risen among health professionals as cases have surged in states across the country – including Florida, Arizona, California, Texas, and Georgia. In response, some states like California and Texas have rolled back reopening plans to curb the spread of the virus.Social distancing could be part of our lives \u0027for a long time\u0027England\u0027s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has told the Lords Science and Technology Committee that social distancing is likely to be necessary for a long time.He said: There are some things which we started right at the beginning, which absolutely have to continue for a prolonged period of time - washing hands, isolation, household isolation.\u0026nbspAnd then we\u0027ve added to that things like contact tracing, most recently face coverings.\u0026nbspAnd these are issues of, and issues around distancing, which have been varied but the reality is distancing remains an important part of this mix and how it\u0027s interpreted in different governments has evolved.\u0026nbspBut it has not gone away. So, all of those need to continue for a long period of time.People need to \u0027buy into\u0027 public health guidancePublic health guidance needs people buying into it so they understand what actions to take during the coronavirus pandemic, the chief medical officer for England has said.Speaking to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, Prof Chris Whitty acknowledged there were technical variations in terms of surgical face masks or face coverings available to the public.\u0026nbspBut he added: The variation in those is much less important than getting people to do the basics.\u0026nbspAnd the basics are, if you\u0027re going to wear one in a high risk area it must cover your nose and mouth.\u0026nbspWearing a brilliant mask covering half your mouth, only your mouth or only your nose, clearly is only going to have limited effect.Coronavirus testingBoris Johnson has vowed to increase the UK\u0027s Covid-19 testing capacity to 500,000 tests per day by the end of October in a bid to keep any potential second wave this winter under control.The British prime minister warned\u0026nbspthe rise in the number of people with\u0026nbspcoronavirus-type symptoms due to seasonal illnesses could make the job of tracking the virus harder in colder months.Speaking at a press briefing at Downing Street, Mr Johnson said testing capacity currently stands at 200,000 per day.The PM said: As we approach winter we will need to go further, not least because many more people will show Covid-like symptoms as a result of seasonal illnesses and therefore require a test.So we will further increase testing capacity to at least 500,000 antigen tests a day and 3.5 million antigen tests a week by the end of October.Press AssociationLondon mayor has \u0027no confidence\u0027 in local lockdown plansSadiq Khan has said he has no confidence in the government\u0027s ability to enforce a lockdown in London in the case of a local outbreak.As the prime minister set out plans to ease guidance on employees returning to their workplaces, the London mayor said the government is likely to be too slow to react to a potential second spike in the capital.Mr Khan told PA news agency: I haven\u0027t got any confidence that we could have a geographical lockdown in London.We probably could lock down a building, if it\u0027s a factory or a place of worship or a school.That\u0027s why it\u0027s really important at long last that the government provides us with the power, resources, clarity and information, should there be a need, heaven forbid, for a local lockdown in London.He added that workplaces must be properly prepared with hand sanitisers and social distancing measures, and that employers stagger start times to avoid overcrowding on public transport.Wales workers told to continue working\u0026nbspfrom homeMark Drakeford said the Welsh Government\u0027s advice to workers was to stay at home and work from home if they are able to do so.I positively don\u0027t want people to be returning to offices in the way that we did before coronavirus happened, the First Minister said.\u0026nbspCoronavirus has been an awful experience but one of the positive things we have learnt is just how possible it is for people to work very effectively from home without the need for large numbers of people to be travelling at peak times of the day to the office locations.Additional powers enable councils to take \u0027swift and effective action\u0027Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said additional powers for councils would allow for swift and effective action against Covid-19.He added: Locally led responses have proven to be the best way to tackle significant outbreaks, which this framework rightly emphasises.\u0026nbspCouncils know their local communities best and know how to address each unique outbreak. It is good that this framework also acknowledges the tireless efforts of councils already to try and contain and prevent local outbreaks.\u0026nbspGreater powers for councils to take swift and effective action to address local outbreaks will hopefully help avoid the need for more stringent measures to be imposed locally.A statement from the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre said they are delighted that indoor performances can resume with socially distanced audiences from 1 August.With the restrictions of social distancing in place it will not be practical or economically viable for many shows to open and it takes time for shows to rehearse and prepare and to build up an audience, it added.\u0026nbspHowever this is another welcome step on the road map towards opening with full audiences very soon.Indoor theatre expected to resume from 1 AugustLive indoor theatre and concerts will be able to resume with socially distanced audiences from 1August.The prime minister said indoor performances with live audiences will be allowed, subject to the success of pilots, and trials will begin of larger gatherings in places like sport stadiums.However, some arts venues have said it is not financially viable to reopen with social distancing in place.Director and choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne wrote on Twitter: Why make these announcements when they know that the vast majority of theatre, dance and music is not financially viable under \u0027Covid secure\u0027 conditions?It comes after the government announced a £1.57 billion support package to protect the future of Britain\u0027s arts, with museums, galleries and theatres, independent cinemas, heritage sites and music venues eligible for emergency grants and loans.Some theatres have already closed down, making staff redundant, amid the pandemic and high-profile industry figures have warned\u0026nbspthe industry might never recover without significant intervention.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising.

Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.After two long weeks under lockdown, there is to be no respite for some of Leicester – not just yet. Another fortnight of restrictions beckons for the city and its people. Beyond that, who knows what lies in store for this corner of the country.“I’m fed up, really fed up,” says Sylvia Beynon, a resident of Oadby. The borough, along with Wigston and Leicester itself, is set to remain in lockdown due to its high incidence of cases – yet neighbouring areas have been given the green light to finally lift certain measures from 24 July.“It’s not fair, it really isn’t. I’m just so upset and angry,” adds Ms Beynon. “I think we’re being hung out to dry. We’re all doing exactly what we’re supposed to do. We’re getting the tests, we’re following the rules, we’re doing what’s been asked of us. People’s patience is starting to run thin.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAgainst mounting anger on the ground, the government has made its position and approach clear. Addressing the House of Commons on Thursday, health secretary Matt Hancock said the continuation of the lockdown was “vital for the health of everyone in Leicester”.The latest figures indicate that the virus certainly hasn’t subsided within the city. According to Mr Hancock, the current seven-day infection rate now stands at 119 cases per 100,000 people – down from 135 when the prolonged lockdown was first announced. Progress, but as Mr Hancock added, there is “still a lot to do”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThere are some small comforts to look forward to, though. From 24 July, restrictions on some non-essential shops and early years childcare will be lifted, while those outside of the reduced lockdown boundary will be allowed to enjoy the freedoms currently available to the rest of the country.But for those caught inside the city’s hotspots, there’s no suggestion yet as to when restaurants, pubs and bars will reopen, leaving Leicester’s hospitality sector vulnerable to further economic damage and decay.“Many small businesses in Leicester are going to struggle to survive during this additional period of lockdown they certainly need additional help from the government,” Nigel Porter, the city’s only Liberal Democrat councillor, tells The Independent.However, he stressed that “putting the economy ahead of health” risked endangering the local population. “At the end of the day the priority has to be to get on top of the virus and until the number of positive cases in Leicester starts to drop the city will remain in lockdown.”While other local leaders have accepted that the city “cannot return to business as usual”, as Leicester East MP Claudia Webbe wrote on Twitter, Sir Peter Soulsby held few punches in his response to the government’s latest announcement.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have left two areas in there – one that has a Liberal Democrat council, the other that has a Labour mayor.“The fact is they have focused in a way that is clearly party political and that’s not a way to deal with the virus.”The mayor’s comments have been met with a mixed reaction among locals, but they nonetheless point to a fraying relationship between Whitehall and Leicester City Council.Of course, Sir Peter is not alone in his criticism of the government. Kamlesh Khunti, a member of the Independent Sage board and a professor of vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, told The Independent that even now, after weeks of awareness around the city’s issues, local public health authorities are “still not getting data quickly enough”.“Local teams need to be more involved too,” he says. “This needs to be all localised. We know all the networks, the shopkeepers, the faith centres, we know the business community. These are the people who can influence what happens.“It has been a complete shock to us. We’re a proud city and this has not been good for anyone here. It’s not good for the community, for our businesses or our universities.”He said that although he was saddened by Thursday’s news, he was not necessarily surprised, explaining that an increase in targeted testing across the city’s most infected areas would be reflected in the statistics.“We will identify more patients if we continue doing more tests, especially in this high risk population. Worryingly this strategy may continue our city having high rates for quite a few weeks with disastrous consequences.“The high rates are not because people aren’t socially distancing - they’re all doing that has been asked of them over the last few weeks. This is why our local people are shocked, frustrated and angry.”Understandably, the continuation of lockdown is proving a tough pill to swallow for Leicester – especially compared to the soft-touch approach adopted by authorities in Blackburn with Darwen, where residents have been urged to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings after a recent spike in cases.“We were never given that opportunity,” says Jon Porter, a resident in Wigston, which has reported the second highest number of infections across all of Leicestershire.“Why wasn’t Leicester given that opportunity? Why weren’t we warned early on that Leicester is struggling? That was when we should have acted and introduce localised measures, like Blackburn. We weren’t told and now it’s too late.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbspHEREThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boosting businesses that protect nature but also bring benefits to people and governments is the best path to showing the value of conservation in Africa, two of the continent’s leading economic thinkers have said.  Every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to prove its economic value, with quick wins like logging or farming winning out so far over conserving wildlife habitat.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 percent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow. Key to that success was strong leadership, transparent laws, and making it easy to do business, Ms Akamanzi added.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our social care system relies on many overseas workers, we should be welcoming them in not shutting them out.The new plans, promised for years since Britain voted to leave the EU back in , will see freedom of movement scrapped in favour of an Australian-style points-based scheme.Under the new system, foreign nationals applying to come to the UK for work purposes will have to meet certain criteria.It will assign points for specic skills, qualications, salaries or professions, and visas will only be awarded to those who gain enough points.The minimum requirements will include having a job offer from an approved sponsor that suits their skill level and being able to speak English. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-TABLE-PRITIS-POINT-SYSTEM-V.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Foreign nationals wishing to come to the UK for work purposes will need to score  points to successfully apply for an online “e-visa”.If an applicant meets the criteria of the minimum requirements, they will be awarded  points.But to score above this threshold they will have to meet other criteria based on salary, seeking to work in a sector with a recognised labour shortage or a having a PhD.While most will be expected to earn a minimum of £, a year, some such as lab technicians with prized skills will be able to come in with a salary as low as £,.To score  points, foreign nationals will need to be able to prove they have a job offer from an approved sponsor that is appropriate to their skill level.A further  points will be scoredthe job is in an occupation with a labour shortage such as engineering or information technology.While a university doctorate gives ten points with the figure rising to  pointsthe qualication is in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.Ten points will be awarded for an annual salary of £,, rising to  points over £,.A builders labourer who cannot speak English but has been offered a salary of £,, for instance, would only score  points and would be blocked from coming to the UK to work.Likewise, a skilled plumber with good English on £,-a -year, would also be awarded  points but denied access.But a primary school teacher offered an annual salary of £,, who also speaks good English, would score  points and would secure a visa to work in the UK.A university lecturer with a maths PhD with an offer of a £, would be awarded  points and would also secure a visa.It follows the points systems used in Australia and New Zealand.Ms Patel also announced the beefed-up measures for Border Force and immigration officials today.The Government revealed even criminals not sentenced to  months face being booted out of Britain.It said: Those already in the UK who are sentenced to  months or more in prison must be considered for deportation.Where the -month criminality deportation threshold is not met, a foreign criminal will still be considered for deportation where it is conducive to the public good, including where they have serious or persistent criminality.The change means criminals from the European Union are treated the same as currently happens to those from non-EU countries.Anyone deemed as a skilled worker - including postgraduate students - will still have the right to bring their families and children to the UK.Spouses, partners and children under  will still be eligible to come to the UK and stay.They can also have near full access to the UKs jobs market, and will be able to attend schools here.However, they will be made to pay the health surcharge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is. But the facts on the ground do not match the rhetoric.Anda right-wing politician was suggesting the introduction of a border blocking free movement by citizens of the UK we would never hear the end of it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you say it, produce the facts”.Today, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the alleged interference unacceptable.He said: The Government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the  General Election through the online amplication of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.Sensitive Government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the  General Election and disseminated online via the social media  Reddit. When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the General Election.Whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable. It is, and will always be, an absolute priority to protect our democracy and elections.The Government said today:There is an ongoing criminal investigation and it would be inappropriate for us to say anything further at this point.Mr Corbyn responded to the claims in a Facebook post calling the docs genuine.He said: The documents we revealed during the general election about the danger of a Trump trade deal for our NHS were genuine - as is the threat of a £ million a week higher drugs bill.The Tories want to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support.Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes. Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.It came on the same day the UK was able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.I AM today updating Parliament on the ongoing investigations into the leak of the UK-US Free Trade Agreement documents ahead of the General Election in .

These bring together government, civil society and private sector organisations to monitor and respond to interference, to ensure our democracy stays open, transparent and resilient. During the  General Election a cross-Government election security cell was stood up to coordinate responses to threats and hazards relating to the election.On the basis of extensive analysis, the Government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the  General Election through the online amplication of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents.Sensitive Government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the  General Election and disseminated online via the social media  Reddit.

We fully support the recent action taken by our German partners who exposed Russian responsibility for the hack of their Parliament in  as well as their intention to act against those responsible under the cyber sanctions regime. The UK Government laid the statutory instrument for our own cyber sanctions regime on  June.The online forum Reddit confirmed the NHS leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.A statement from Reddit at the time said: We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK.We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.The Labour leader was branded a foolish pawn over the blunder.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverley blasted: Corbyn has some serious questions to answer.Is he a foolish pawn in a Russian disinformation campaign, or did he know where the leaked documents came from Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Labour were quick to pounce on the contents of the papers, claiming they revealed the plot against our NHS.Experts previously raised fears over the origin of the documents.Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at media analytics outfit Graphika, said: “It’s on the same set of websites, it’s using the same types of accounts and making the same language errors.It’s either the Russian operation or someone trying hard to look like it.”Ousted MP and Corbynite Laura Pidcock even got into a row with Skys Kay Burley over the documents, refusing five times to say whether the partys leaked NHS dossier came from Russia.The then shadow secretary of state for employment rights got into a spat with the journalistdays after Jeremy Corbyn claimed hed found evidence that the NHS would be up for sale in a series of papers.The original Reddit posting was uploaded on October  but was little known until Mr Corbyn unveiled it at a highly trailed campaign event.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They share a year-old chihuahua called Luna, which Anne-Sophie is believed to have kept in the split.A source close to the DJ said: “Roman loved Soph and things had been going really well for them. But being in lockdown is tough for any couple and they just weren’t able to make things work, which has been upsetting and tough for them both.“His pals have encouraged him to move on and have got him on Raya, which is packed with attractive and creative women. He’s set up a profile with his best photos and has set the music on his page to the song Gold, by his dad’s band. He’s having fun with it.”Roman’s career has gone from strength to strength in the past year, having finished third in the TV jungle, landed an ITV talk show with his pop star dad and become a regular on Celebrity Gogglebox.But in December he was hoping to start a family and thought Anne-Sophie was the girl he would do it with.He said at the time: “Every time I see a child, I get broody.”Plenty more fish in the sea, Roman.DESPITE not ­seeing each other for four months, The Pussycat Dolls are now closer than ever, according to Carmit Bachar.The singer, who posed in a patterned bikini and floral blue shirt for the cover of Lapalme magazine, said of bandmates Nicole Scherzinger, Kimberly Wyatt, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta that absence really has made the heart grow fonder.Carmit explained: “We’ve been going through similar things.

Cara, who spent lockdown in the US, joined American Kaia, her model mum Cindy Crawford and dad Randy Gerber in a social bubble when restrictions relaxed last month.This included joining the family for dinner at swanky Malibu restaurant Nobu in June, with Cara having split from her long-term girlfriend, Pretty Little Liars actress Ashley Benson, the previous month.With Kaia quickly becoming the model of the moment, I couldn’t think of a better pal than Cara – named the UK’s highest-earning catwalk queen last year – to help her navigate the industry.I can reveal she is dating rapper Jonathan Kabamba, who she posted this photo of on Instagram yesterday.She captioned it: “My Love, my King.

You Needed Mewas always our first choice, the song we were both excited about.” And they are already writing new material.Keith said: “With lockdown, we’re miles ahead where we were hoping to be for the new album.“Boyz-le has gone from strength to strength.

Then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of her citizenship on national security grounds last February after Times journalist Anthony Lloyd found her, nine months pregnant, in Syria.She yesterday won a bombshell legal ruling to be allowed back to the UK to challenge her revoked British citizenship.She was seen shortly after wearing full black Islamic dress and burka in a refugee camp, her newborn baby having died.Upon herto Britain Begum is likely to be arrested and questioned, before facing trial on terror-related charges, reports the Mirror.The bombshell ruling could now open the door for  terrorists - including other ISIS brides and fighters - to make similar audacious bids toto Britain.And her brother-in-law and electrician Mohammed Rahman said last night he is stuck between a rock and a hard place.He said: She’s part of my extended family. I am not going to try and cause any rts between me and my brother.I’m very uncomfortable with the whole situation. I’m in between a rock and a hard place. I have my own opinions. I dont want to offend anyone.He added: I’m not very close with my brother’s we - I’ve met Shamima, but only at family s. There’s a big age dference between me and her anyway. That’s it.I have sympathy for her family. It’s a tough thing for a family to lose a child, but thats as far as I’ll go.I only found out she went to Syria on the news. I didn’t even know. They didn’t broach it with me. You take the hint.Senior judges said yesterday that Begum, who left aged , should be allowed toto the UK to challenge being denied her British citizenship.It is a bitter blow for the government who revoked her citizenship last year - sparking an appeal which has cost taxpayers more than £, so far.Begum and two pals – Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase – ran away to Syria in February .Begum used her elder sister’s passport to flee with her Bethnal Green Academy friends.The trio flew to Turkey and then crossed the border into Syria with the aid of smugglers.Within weeks of arriving, Shamima was married to Isis jihadi Yago Riedijk, , from Holland.They had two children who died from malnutrition and disease.The couple were separated as they fled Baghouz, the village where a few hundred Isis fighters were holed up in a desperate last stand.Shamima ended up in a Kurdish refugee camp where she gave birth to her third child.Eldest sister Renu revealed that her family had lost contact with her for the “longest time” until she was found by a Times journalist.One source said today: Why should anyone who leaves the UK to join ISIS then complain when they have their British passport taken away Shamima Begum made a conscious choice to go to a terrorist warzone, where she has now been stranded. Shes not able to appeal her case in person as a direct result. Many people will rightly ask, Wheres the unfairness in that The Court of Appeal ruled: Fairness and justice must, on the facts of this case, outweigh the national security concerns, so that the leave to enter appeals should be allowed.But Lord Justice Flaux - sitting with Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Singh - said: The only way in which she can have a fair and effective appeal is to be permitted to come into the United Kingdom to pursue her appeal.Begum was one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in  to join ISIS.After initially marrying an ISIS fighter and sewing terrorists into suicide vests, she was found pregnant more than three years later in a Syrian refugee camp - but her baby boy died not long after being born.Figures show her lawyers have claimed £, in legal aid trying to win back her UK citizenship - but sources say the true public bill is at least double and tops £,.When she was discovered and stripped of her citizenship, her own dad slammed her choice to run away to join the terror group.Ahmed Ali said he was on the side of the government and condemned her lack of remorse before claiming he was misquoted.Now that she is able to leave the camp in Syria andto the UK to launch her appeal, it is likely the Government would struggle to send Begum back to a war-torn country - evenshe fails to get citizenship back.Sajid Javid warned: Most critically, allowing her and indeed other terrorists back into the UK to pursue an appeal would create a real security risk that cannot be fully mitigated, even with the ersion of signicant resources.If Ms Begum does come to this country it will prove impossible to remove her.Following the ruling a Home Office spokesperson said: “This is a very disappointing decision by the Court. We will now apply for permission to appeal this judgement, and to stay its effects pending any onward appeal.“The Government’s top priority remains maintaining our national security and keeping the public safe.”Lord Justice Flaux ruled the national security concerns about her could be addressed and managedshe s to the United Kingdom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The crucial thing is that they are immune.The Oxford Uni study suggests the epidemiological limit to reach herd immunity may be greatly reduceda fraction of the population is unable to transmit the virus.This is feasible, they add,people have inbuilt resistance or cross-protection from exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.The report says: Signicant reductions in expected mortality can also be seen in settings where a fraction of the population is resistant to infection.Results suggest that sufficient herd-immunity may already be in place to substantially mitigate a potential second wave, the researchers add.It has been evident from the outset that the risk of severe disease and death from Covid- is not unormly distributed across all age classes.The bulk of deaths among the over  million cases reported worldwide are occurring among older age classes and those with [pre-existing conditions].“It is further becoming clear that risk of infection is also not unormly distributed across the population, the reports says.Scientists at Oxford point to those managing to fend off the virus as having high ing immunity.And,antibodies to the disease are built up in - per cent of the population, this is entirely compatible with local levels of immunity having approached or even exceeded the herd immunity threshold.In which case the risk and scale of resurgence is lower than currently perceived, say the researchers.Immunity to the bug has been hitting headlines for months, with Kings College research saying antibody responses to the killer bug “can be detected in most infected iniduals - days following the onset of Covid- symptoms”.It investigated samples from  coronavirus patients,  days after they had been diagnosed with Covid-.Worryingly, Kings Colleges study found that immunity to fight coronavirus might disappear only three months after infection.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And in that situation, theres absolutely no reason I can see to change it.The measures come despite repeated warnings both in public and private from his scientic experts.Boris Johnson optimistically announced this morning Brits will be able to hug all their friends and family by Christmas.Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: More close contact between family and friends where we can.It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the restrictions and allow ato more normality by November, possibly in time for Christmas.However, the PM made clear that this was all conditional on our ability to defeat the virus.He cautiously told Brits eager to hug their family that we have a plan where we hope for the best and plan for the worst.The PM today handed councils powers for lightning lockdowns so they can shut pubs and cafés without going to Government first.The rules will allow town hall bosses to ban weddings and other gatherings at short notice.Boris explained:They will be able to close specic premises, shut public outdoor spaces and cancel events.These powers will enable local authorities to act more quickly in response to outbreaks where speed is paramount.Where justied by the evidence, ministers will be able to close whole sectors or types of premises in an area, introduce local stay-at-home orders, prevent people entering or leaving defined areas, reduce the size of gatherings beyond the national defined rules or restrict transport systems serving local areas.Boris also gave the NHS an extra £billion so hospitals are “battle ready” for winter and can ensure a second wave is avoided.The PM also set a target of , tests a day by the end of October so flare-ups can be dealt with swtly.A PR blitz will now encourage Brits to get a virus test and promote walk-in testing sites.Leicester became the first city to go into a local lockdown, and now councils will have the power to swoop as soon as necessary where. Party goers and parents alike were also dealt a blow today as the Prime Minister has reiterated that nightclubs and soft play areas must remain closed.However, casinos, leisure centres and bowling alleys in England will be allowed to reopen in August.The NHS funding comes with fears growing over the virus running riot over the winter.Coronavirus thrives in the cold and spreads more easily indoors, with doctors concerned it could surge when flu is circulating.The extra billions will go towards keeping on the Nightingales and private hospital spaces.No  will also carry out a flurry of exercises to “stress test” their NHS winter plans.Boris announced the first lockdown measures back on March .Brits were told only to travelit was essential to do so for work.On May , Mr Johnson announced this was being relaxed and encouraged construction and manufacturing workers to head back to work.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And those measures introduced on the fourth of July will also not apply, he added.It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to set out how he wants to see the economy and society slowly adapt back to some form of normality over the next three to six months.He will also flesh out the Governments whack-a-mole strategy, spelling out extra measures to stop outbreaks over the coming months.In Leicester, most schools have already broken up for the summer break.The measures would be reviewed again in two weeks to seemore progress has been made, and more rules can be relaxed.Mr Hancock also confirmed that some types of coronavirus swab tests would stop being used for the meantime as the Government assesses their safety.Some were not up to the usual high standards, the health secretary says - but stressed that there is no evidence of harm or impact on test results.The Health Secretary said: I hope these careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to the people of Leicester and Leciestershire.I say this directly to the people... I pay tribute to you. You have all shown respect for one another.I understand this hasnt been easy.There is still a lot to do and the public health messages remain critical.Please do not lose your resolve. The sooner we get this virus under control, the sooner we can restore le in Leicester.The city was the first in the UK to be put back into lockdown last month after a spike in cases.Testing centres swooped on the city and people were encouraged to stay home. Shops were shut up again and pubs and restaurants did not open on July  as in the rest of the country. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: As this data confirms, coronavirus cases in Leicester were signicantly higher than other parts of the country – and we took clear and decisive action to save lives.“We are working closely with the local authorities to ensure that these measures are only in place as long as is necessary, and we will set out the next steps by  July.”The Government has stressed that data has been provided to the Directors of Public Health throughout the incident.The lockdown currently covers the city of Leicester as well as surrounding areas including Birstall, Beaumont Leys, Glenfield and South Wigston. It has been suggested that families living in closer quarters, combined with a higher population of people whose English is a second language, may have contributed to the spike in cases.Workers in cramped clothing factories have also been blamed, with Police and the National Crime Agency investigating possible links to modern slavery.But Sir Peter told Sky News there is no evidence whatsoever to show coronavirus was being transmitted in clothing factories.Theres nothing in the data that suggests it is transmitting in places of work, he said.Mr Hancock revealed flare-ups are being swtly and silently dealt with.He said more than  local actions are being taken across the country each week.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC that data published on Saturday showed the city is really quite an outlier compared with anywhere  in the country.Prof Van-Tam told the BBC: The situation has improved but it needs to go further.He said that, while it would not be his decision to end the lockdown, doing so cant be rushed.Pressed on whether Leicesters lockdown is likely to be lted, Prof Van-Tam said: With any of these things, usually the way that one approaches them from a public health perspective is to take a phased approach.Normally you dont just go from having the brakes on heavily to just taking the brakes off completely.I think thats a reasonable expectation to set.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today’s government claim is an attempt to ert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report.The former Labour boss refused to answer questions from journalists outside his home in North London this afternoon.Mr Corbyn was asked by a journalist: Mr Corbyn, Do you have anything to say about Russian disruption  Were you complicit Did you help those who attacked our election, Mr Corbyn Mr Corbyn then shut the gate and said: Goodbye.The reporter continued: Do you have anything to say at all, Mr Corbyn, about whats happened today Do you regret whats happened Are you complicit with Russian interference in our elections, Mr Corbyn Would you do it again, Mr Corbyn Do you have anything to add about what happened, Mr Corbyn Do you regret your actions, Mr Corbyn, do you regret taking that document The ex-Labour leader then shut the door after wheeling his bike inside, followed with another goodbye to the reporter.The Government said today:The dossier of leaked minutes from trade talks, which Mr Corbyn claimed was evidence Boris Johnson would sell the NHS to Donald Trump, was ripped off the website.Analysts at the time claimed the papers, waved by Mr Corbyn at an election rally, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign called Secondary Infektion.Mr Corbyn has been repeatedly accused of being soft on Russia, even refusing to blame them for the Salisbury Novichok attack.The ousted hard left Labour leader would only go as far as saying “the evidence points strongly” to the Kremlin.In March last year Mr Corbyn sparked a furious backlash after warning Theresa May against “rushing way ahead of the evidence” on Salisbury.His spokesman at the time said memories of the Iraqi “dodgy” dossier meant it was “problematic” to accept the Government’s position.Labour today distanced themselves from Russia.A spokesman said: “We condemn any attempt by Russia..to interfere in our country’s democratic processes.Labour stands ready to work cross-party to protect our nation’s security.A senior Russian politician said today that allegations that Russia tried to meddle in the  General Election are anti-Russian nonsense which undermine UK-Russia relations and the UKs own authority.The Russian Foreign Ministry added: “The statement is so foggy and contradictory that it is almost impossible to understand it.If it’s inappropriate to say something then dont say it. If you say it, produce the facts”.The online forum Reddit confirmed the leak was linked to the Kremlin in December last year.It came as Vladimir Putins Russia was today blamed for being behind repeated cyber attacks to try and steal a coronavirus vaccine from Britain.The UK has been able to point the finger at Russia for the very first time in explosive claims President Putin knew about attacks on Britains coronavirus vaccine project.A joint operation with the US and Canada has uncovered a malicious campaign to steal information uncovered by Britains top scientists on coronavirus with targeted attacks since March.No said today they believe the attacks came from a group known at APT - part of the Russian intelligence service.The clandestine group of hackers is also known as “the Dukes” or “Cozy Bear”.The PMs official spokesman said today: The attacks which are taking place against scientists and others doing vital work to combat coronavirus are despicable.Working with our allies, we will call out those who seek to do us harm in cyber space and hold them to account.Heres what we know about the attacks:The National Cyber Security Centre have thrown every protection they have at Britains vaccination projects to keep them safe from attempts to steal information.British research projects are at the forefront of the effort to find a vaccine with scientists at Oxford University and Imperial University London leading the charge to prevent thousands more from dying.Britain is expected to publish a long-delayed report into Russian influence in British politics next week.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I saw her on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday without a mark.”Mr Baruch said he had walked into Ms Heard’s apartment unexpectedly and it was “obviously the wrong time for her” - suggesting she hadn’t had time to fake her injuries yet.He said: “She wasnt wearing a speck of makeup and there was nothing on her face. I was a foot away from her and there was nothing.“I didn’t see a single bruise, redness, mark or red-tinted cellphone imprint. Nothing, not a thing.”He added: “She filed for a fraudulent domestic violence order to extort and blackmail Johnny in the orce.”The court was previously told how Depp was angry and spoiling for a fight when he showed up at the apartment.Sasha Wass QC put to Depp: You immediately launched into accusations that Ms Heard had defecated in the bed. You were ranting and raving.“You grabbed her phone, wound your arm around like a bowler and threw the phone hard at Ms Heard’s face. It made contact with the right side of her face.”Ms Heard was on the phone to a friend at the time, TV host pal iO Tillett Wright. The call was still active and Ms Heard asked her to call , the court heard.Ms Wright texted their mutual friend Rocky Pennington saying: “JD attacking Amber. She told me to call .

The firm has donated a total of £, to the party since April , according to the Electoral Commission. The most recent donation, of £, was made to the party in September . The firm has also employed Owen Paterson, a Tory MP and former minister, as an advisor since , and is paid £, a year. The Mirror understands red flags were raised about the aposCEapos safety stamps on the Chinese-made tests supplied by Randox. Physical inspection of the tests led to questions about the sterility of the swabs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Clinical advice is that thereaposs no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected, there is no evidence of any issues with our other test swabs and there is no impact on access to testing. In a statement issued yesterday, the Department of Health said: “As a precautionary measure and while we investigate further, NHS Test and Trace are requesting that all settings pause the use of Randox test kits with immediate effect and until further notice.” Randox, which described its system as part of the “cornerstone of Government testing across the UK”, was awarded the contract in May as the Government was racing to meet its target of , tests per day. Grilling Mr Hancock in the House of Commons on Thursday evening, shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth questioned the awarding of the contract which he said was “given to Randox without any competitive tender”.  The firm, based in County Antrim, posted on its website in June: “Our test was adopted by the NHS and Public Health England and forms the cornerstone of Government testing across the UK. Using the Randox-patented Biochip Array Technology, the most-comprehensive multiplex PCR  on the market.” As a result of the recall of the kits, a number of testing sites have also been forced to suspend all activity until further notice. This afternoon Wirral Council announced that it had closed down the Bidston Coronavirus Testing Site near Birkenhead “for precautionary reasons, due to a safety recall issued by the Government on Randox test kits”. The Department for Health and Social Care said there wasnapost enough time to perform a full procurement contest because of the short notice in ramping up coronavirus testing.A spokesperson said:   “The speed at which we have increased our testing capacity is unprecedented and a real success made possible by teamwork between the Government and key partners.“In a matter of weeks we have engineered the largest ever expansion of British diagnostic capability - scaling up a nationwide network of drive-in testing sites, introducing home testing, deploying mobile testing units operated by Armed Forces personnel, building three new ‘mega labs’ to analyse test samples, and more than doubling the capacity of the NHS and Public Health England laboratories.” "},{"url":null,"title":"colonel tom moore given up","story":"NewsColonel Tom Moore had given up on love before meeting we when he was Colonel Tom Moore has today been knighted by The Queen for his amazing fundraising efforts which raised more than £million for NHS charitiesShareCommentsByJane LavenderAssistant Editor:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video captain-tom-moore-knighted-queen-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news colonel-tom-moore-given-up-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

When she moved to the UK and set up home with her future husband, Meghan brought Guy with her, but left Bogart behind, with insiders saying it was because he was too old to fly. This was never confirmed by the Palace, however they said Bogart was living with friends, and explained that moving him to the UK would have lots of complexity to it. But now the Sussexes have ed to the US, many fans hoped Meghan would be able to be reunited with the Labrador-German shepherd cross - who she regularly gushed about in pre-royal interviews - but sadly that doesnapost seem to be the case.  An insider told the Sun : Meghan adored that dog but the decision not to take him back was based on Bogart’s relationship with Harry.Bogart never took to Harry when they spent time together in Canada. He didn’t like Harry. Meghan was very vocal about the fact it wouldn’t be fair to take him back full-time, given Bogart’s feelings for her husband. During September , Meghan and Harry adopted a new dog, Oz, who joined Guy in their Kensington Palace home. However Meghan hinted that people might have actually got the name wrong during an official engagement. During their first visit to Sussex  since being named Duke and Duchess of the county on their wedding day, Meghan and Harry popped into the Survivorsapos Network, a charity that supports victims sexual violence. They were presented with a framed picture of Meghanaposs beagle Guy. Harry then confirms they also have a new furry friend, saying: No oneaposs even seen our [new] dog, so thataposs amazing. Meghan then adds: I know, and they keep getting her name wrong.It has been widely reported that the couple named the new addition Oz, and many believe it was a nod to their  tour to Australia and New Zealand.Meghan is a huge animal lover, and has previously said the rescue dogs mean the absolute world to her and has referred to them as my loves and my boys.Both dogs regularly featured on her pre-royal  Instagram  account, and Meghan even shared a snap of Guy modelling a Union flag jumper.She often used the adoptdontshop hashtag in her Instagram posts.

The -year-old carer from Southend, Essex, claims the homegrown vegetables left her in agony after she ate them for the first time. Danielle Baxter said she became sick with vomiting and diarrhoea within hours of eating the roast vegetables. Sales of the seeds she used have now been suspended amid reports several families fell ill after eating the courgettes grown in their gardens.  She had reportedly planted Unwins seeds, and its parent company Westland this week has suspended sale of its courgette packets following complaints of sickness, reports The Sun. Danielle said: “I had a high temperature and I was vomiting and had diarrhoea. I phoned  after seeing online that courgettes can produce poison. “The paramedic told me to get checked out at AE straight away.  I didn’t start feeling better until five days later.” Courgettes, also called zucchini, can produce cucurbitacins — a chemical that causes nausea and stomach problemsit occurs in abnormally high volumes in the popular vegetable. Five years ago an elderly German died in a case linked to courgettes he had used in a stew.

The horried housewe says she was horried to find the sullied parcel next to sanitised baby feed bottles. New mum Ellice Moran called the police after she found the package along with what she believes was a trail of bloodied fingerprints in the kitchen. The -year-old was playing with her newborn baby Grace at her Newcastle home when she heard the back door swing open. Assuming it was her partner Lewis on a break from work, she called out for him but got no reply. After being met with silence, she headed downstairs where to her horror she found an HM parcel on her kitchen worktop with fresh blood smeared over the packaging. Ellice said: Iaposve just had my first baby six weeks ago but due to social distancing nobody has really been able to see her so my mum ordered her some dresses from HM and got them delivered straight here. I wasnapost expecting the delivery. My partner went to work and I was in the house. I thought I heard him come back in for something because I heard footsteps around the kitchen and noise from the back door and the back gate. I shouted aposcan you get us a drink from the shopapos but I got no response which I thought was weird, I thought I was being ignored. I went down and he wasnapost there. I texted him and said aposhave you just been in apos He replied aposno.apos That was when I suddenly spotted the parcel on my kitchen bench sitting there next to my babyaposs feed bottles.  I was shocked to see that it had blood on it. The panicked mother-of-one began disinfecting the gate and the door of her home in Soulby Court, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She left the parcel for her gloved partner to move before she noticed the bloody fingerprints on her cupboard. I had to disinfect the whole kitchen because thataposs where I keep my babyaposs milk and tea cups. The cupboard where the bloodstain was is where Lewis keeps his wallet and money. Luckily itaposs just filled with baby Gaviscon at the minute.  I think the driver was being an opportunist. The fact the parcel had blood on it shows that he or she obviously wasnapost sanitising their hands before handling the parcels because they would have noticed their hand was bleeding because it would have stung. They werenapost in longer than a minute but they definitely did linger. I feel really panicky, I suffer from PTSD and anxiety anyway from not nice things that have happened in the past and so moving into my first home in January, that was scary for me. I was having panic attacks in the bathroom and couldnapost go in the shower unless someone  was in the house and then it just so happens the one day I leave the door slightly ajar because it was warm, someone lets themselves in. Both Ellice and her mother attempted to contact HM and Hermes but to no avail. My mum hasnapost been able to access her email address for a while so she canapost get the tracking order number. Obviously, she didnapost think that something like this was going to happen, she didnapost think sheaposd need it. I have tried to get into contact with Hermes and you canapost unless you have a tracking number so we are literally stuck. However, the police are taking a statement from me in case I do notice something is missing and they are taking a swab to figure out who it was as contacting Hermes is near impossible.

While leaving, the Prince got into a car in a secluded street behind the hospital and sat in the front passenger seat. He did not respond to photographers as he was driven away from the private hospital but he did wave at a nurse as he was escorted to the car.  But today the -year-old and the Queen, , were among a small group of close family and friends who attended the intimate ceremony at All Saints Chapel, Windsor Great Park, this morning. The couple were driven from Windsor Castle, where they have spent lockdown, to the wedding three miles away. Before his appearance today, Buckingham Palace released a commemorative photo to mark Prince Philipaposs th birthday on June . The photo showed the Prince and the Queen at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, where the couple had been shielding since March , days before the UK went into lockdown.  The Queen’s favourite residence, dubbed Operation HMS Bubble, had a reduced household of around  staff. The snap was taken a week before the Princeaposs birthday and showed the Duke in a military Household Division tie and double-breasted jacket, stood beside the head of state wearing an Angela Kelly dress with the Cullinan V diamond brooch first worn by Queen Mary.Philip has spent much of his retirement at his cottage, Wood Farm, on the Sandringham estate, more than  miles away from the Queen, , who was usually at Buckingham Palace or Windsor. Beatrice and Edo announced their engagement last year and planned to marry in May.  One of Beatriceaposs friends told The Sun : They were obviously very keen for the Queen to come so the wedding had to happen before she goes up to Balmoral so this was a great opportunity.So many guests were disappointed not to make the big day but understood the reason for it. They are just like a normal family and had to make sacrices like many others have up and down the country and looking forward to having a wonderful celebration when the time is right. Beatrice and Edoardo began dating in autumn  reportedly getting back in touch at Princess Eugenieaposs wedding to Jack Brooksbank.

It is the first time that the monarch - who has been isolating since the start of the lockdown - has made a public engagement since March . She was seen in public for the first time since lockdown on June  when she attended a stripped back Trooping the Colour. Captain Tom, who turned  in April, raised nearly £million for health service charities by walking laps of his Bedfordshire garden. He will travel with members of his family for the rare, special investiture with the monarch. Royal investitures were put on hold during the pandemic, and those scheduled to take place at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh in June and July were postponed. But the -year-old Queen, who has been staying at Windsor since before lockdown for her safety, will carry out the official engagement in person - rare for the monarch during the pandemic - to honour Captain Tom. It is her first public appearance since Commonwealth Day, when she stood alongside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in one of the coupleaposs last frontline royal engagements. The monarch will use the sword that belonged to her father, George VI, and will present him with the insignia of Knight Bachelor.  The ceremony will take place entirely within the confines of Windsor Castle, with no viewing positions for the public. Members of the public are being asked not to attend Windsor town centre or gather in the hope of seeing any of the ceremony, which will not be visible from any external viewpoint. Captain Tom had set out to raise £,, but his incredible gesture won him fans around the world and saw his fundraising efforts soar. In honour of his incredible achievement, he was given a flypast on his th birthday.  Captain Tom also became the oldest person to ever score a UK Number One single with his rendition of Youaposll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices Of Care Choir. And his incredible efforts saw him awarded a special Pride Of Britain award. Captain Tom said the response to his charitable efforts had been outstanding. He said: Itaposs hard to describe thereaposs been so much kindness shown and so many people making kind remarks.

The Met Office said a cold front will slowly slink across the country from the north, bringing cloud and rain along with it, that will see temperatures about eight degrees cooler on Sunday. Beaches and parks are likely to be busy in the warmest places on Saturday, but Britons are being reminded to follow social distancing rules and other coronavirus lockdown restrictions still in place.Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan toldthe UKaposs warmest spot on Friday, as of pm, was Heathrow Airport, which recorded a temperature of .C. It was expected to rise to C. Mr Morgan said: Its a very warm day out there today. It may be the warmest day of the month so far. July has been a cool month, temperatures have been below average for most places so far. He added: It stays warmer in the south tomorrow, but we do have a cold front moving down from the north. The cold front is expected to bring rain to Scotland and Northern Ireland on Saturday, as well as parts of Wales and northern and central England, during the day.London and the Home Counties will see a maximum temperature of about C as it remains dry and warm. But the cold front will move further south later on Saturday and the rain will be more widespread. Mr Morgan said it will be a disappointing day on Sunday with cloud and outbreaks of rain in afternoon in East Anglia and South East England.Temperatures will be several degrees cooler than Saturday. The conditions will be cool and breezy in the north, where it will feel warm - from the mid teens to low s - in any sunny spells.

Instead under Vladimir Putin, Russia has become a rogue state, waging a new form of war against The West. It stands accused of undermining sovereign nations through cyber hacking, espionage and spreading misinformation. The charge sheet includes the Salisbury poisonings, interfering in the US elections, sabotaging a French TV station and cyber attacks on the German parliament. We can now add to that shameful list the targeting of UK institutions trying to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. The security services deserve credit for foiling this latest attack. Russia could have joined the effort to find a cure for Covid-. But no. It has tried to secure possibly ground-breaking research by cheating. Putin and his corrupt regime have made their country an international outcast.  Put her on trial Shamima Begum left this country to join a terrorist cult that gloated at the slaughter of her fellow Britons. It is easy to understand the anger at the court’s decision to allow her back to contest the stripping of her citizenship. The fact she has shown no remorse adds to the outrage. But, like it or not, Ms Begum is our responsibility. She was just  when she flew to Syria having been indoctrinated here. However grim her actions she should be tried in a UK court. That is how Britain can show it values fair justice, unlike the regime she championed.

I opened the door in my dressing gown too with my kids stood behind me wondering who was at the door with my hair up in a aposmum bunapos - I bet I looked the part. I felt so embarrassed. Even now when he comes to the door I can’t look at him in the eye, just knowing he knows what I get up to makes me cringe. He still delivers all my parcels and every time I open the door I think aposoh why  Please changeapos. Iaposve got years of embarrassment to come.

Lizzie Pocklington, , and her boyfriend Martin, from Nottingham, had spent more than a month trying to decide which colour would look best on their front door.Like any diyer would, Lizzie painted a few potential shades in ying places on her door to see which she liked best, reported Nottingham Live. But thanks to their helpful postie, their decision was made for them. Clearly seeing the trouble the homeowners were having, the friendly woman posted them a note through their letterbox offering her suggestion on which colour they should pick. In the note, the postwoman says: Second green up from bottom of door looks the best followed by a smiley face.  But in the end Lizzie ended up going for her preferred choice - a warm mid-brown London Stone - just a few days before receiving the note and has already spent £ on the paint. Lizzie and Martin had locked horns a number of times about which colour they should choose. Whilst Martin favoured earthy green tones, Lizzie wanted a neutral colour. Lizzie, from Nottingham, said: My boyfriend came into the house and said there was a strange message left by the postie. I looked at it and just started howling because the postie had given us feedback because our door was painted with so many dferent colours. She said she liked the green - which annoyingly was my boyfriend’s favourite colour which is really gutting. And now I’ve put it on twitter everyone seems to agree with her - so I hope I made the right choice.  Lizzie said after the feedback she received online, sheaposs afraid to post the finished product, as everyone sided with the postwomanaposs choice. And said she can’t afford to pay another £ for a dferent paint pot anyway. She said: Eventually it was getting a bit ridiculous with how long it was taking us so we picked a colour, which was the one I liked. “Everyone online is saying I’ve made the wrong choice and she is a postie so she’s a door expert as she’s seen plenty. The postie and twitter all seem to think green is the colour to go with so I’m scared to post the finished product. I’m just hoping it looks nice now. I don’t want to disappoint the postie the next time she’s round and sees it’s not green. But the note made my day - it just cheered everyone up. Lizzie hopes to get in touch with her postie to show her all the messages she received online. She said: I’m hoping to get in touch with her so I’m going to print out all the lovely comments she got and leave it by the door so she can read them. She’s brilliant and everyone thinks so. It’s just nice to have such a wonderful person in the community. Lizzie’s boyfriend Martin said he felt asheaposd proved Lizzie right after pushing for green for months. The -year-old recruiter said: My reaction initially was that I thought the note was telling me to go pick up a parcel from a green door.

We just have one or two that won’t be available for a week or two.“Benji’s been sent for a scan and we believe he’s going to be a few weeks.“We can only guess right now but it’ll be a minimum of a couple of weeks.“As it unfolds we’ll get a better picture.”The -year-old was a key figure as United romped to the Championship title last season, keeping  clean sheets.He will be a huge miss but Mellon is convinced, between Deniz and new kid keeper Jack Newman, the Tangerines can cope without Siegrist for now.Mellon continued: “In an ideal world we’d have them all fit but you have to deal with injuries all the time.“At the minute we just get on with it. If it became a problem for me I’m sure we’d be able to sit down and try to organise something.“I don’t think we’re in that place yet.”As for the rest of the squad, Mellon has been happy with what he has seen from them so far, both in training and against the Steelmen.He added: “We’ve been getting some good work done, getting to know the players better and they’re getting to know me.“Of course you can watch them on video but building that relationship between you is important and we’re getting there now.“The group is really responsive and we’re in a good place.“I think the important thing was everybody got match time and we came out of it with no new injuries.“For me to be able to see them on a football pitch rather than in training was good for building that picture in my head of what we’ve got in terms of how we’re going to play.“That was important and I learned more coming away from the game than I knew before.”What has particularly impressed the -year-old is the attitude of the players and the standards they set for themselves.That is giving Mellon cause for optimism with the new top-flight campaign just over two weeks away.He commented: “From the outside looking in I expected it to be like that because they’d had success and you’d imagine the team spirit would be very strong.“That’s not surprised me. They work really hard every day in training and I don’t have to ask them or stop training to up the tempo, they hit it on their own all the time.“That’s a great credit to them and their professionalism. That’s certainly very pleasing to have.“I’m happy at the minute but we’ve still got a lot of work to do moving forward in achieving our aim of winning games of football.“We’re in a work in progress but we’re moving forward.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen.

Each oyster can filtrate and clean up to  litres of water a day, and the native oyster reefs enhance bioersity by becoming fish spawning grounds and nurseries.Back in March Seawilding secured a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to grow young native oysters over a five-year period in floating baskets on the loch. When they are semi-mature, the oysters will be moved to trial seabed sites around Loch Craignish, where it is hoped they will become a self-sustaining population.Project co-ordinator Danny Renton told the Advertiser: #This is a pioneering project, driven by the Craignish community. Loch Craignish was once a rich environment for native oysters and scallops in particular, but bottom trawling since the s has destroyed much of the seabed. Our community wants to reverse that. We hear a lot about rewilding, but there’s little action been taken so far with restoration of marine habitats – so what we are doing at Loch Craignish is an exciting opportunity to show that marine rewilding and reintroduction of priority marine species is possible.#The project is teaming up with Scottish Association of Marine Scienceand the Department of Aquaculture from Stirling University to enable  marine science students to monitor, survey and research the restoration efforts over the next five years.To kick off the project, the charity along with local partner Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and the Ardfern Yacht Centre, has been introducing native oysters in suspended cages under the pontoons of the yacht centre.Each Oyster Hoister houses  mature oysters which will help clean up the marina water as well as releasing spat, adding to the wider restoration effort in the loch. The hoisters are sponsored by members of the community and boat owners, and the plan is to suspend around  cages by the end of the year.When schools open in August, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation will be working with pupils to monitor the oysters in the cages, measuring their growth and recording bioersity.Oly Hemmings and Pete Creech, the organisation’s rangers, initially want pupils from five local primary schools to get involved in this exciting project. This is an opportunity for pupils to actively take part in valuable research that will be added to data already being collected from other oyster reintroductions throughout the UK.Oly said: #We’ve been interacting with oysters in Argyll for around , years and it is fantastic to be able to get future generations involved in ensuring this relationship continues.#Any schools interested can email Oly and Pete at info@heartofargyllwildle.org for further information. A teacher’s resource pack that can be used in conjunction with school visits or as a standalone resource is available. The educational objectives are fully funded by the project’s funders, the National Lottery, and this includes travel to and from the project venue at Ardfern Yacht Centre. Oly and Pete also intend to engage with older schoolchildren and community groups as the project progresses.For further information about the Loch Craignish Native Oyster Restoration Project, please visit www.seawilding.org or email info@seawilding.org"},{"url":null,"title":"support local call as argyll eases out of lockdown","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPubs and restaurants have opened, tourist attractions can now be visited # and those wild and woolly lockdown locks can finally be tamed by a visit to the hairdresser.As the easing out of coronavirus lockdown continues in Scotland, this week has seen the most signicant relaxation of restrictions imposed as the coronavirus pandemic arrived in March.Among other steps, places of worship and childcare providers can now all reopen.There is also a partial relaxation of  restrictions on attendance at funerals and marriage ceremonies, while closer working may now be permitted in the building trade.All of the above, of course, comes with strict safety requirements which must be adhered to # but they are steps in the right direction.And with many Argyll business ready to re-open, residents are being encouraged to support Argyll and Bute by buying local.#Post COVID-, we should support our local businesses as they have supported us during the pandemic,# said Councillor Alastair Redman, Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for economic growth.#With lockdown in place,# continued Councillor Redman, #our food and drink producers had to change the way they did business – often in imaginative ways.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

I dont even like to call it a career because all Ive ever done since I was  is work for with animals and try and do something to have a contribution to conservation. But in all of that time, living there across  months definitely had its ups and downs to say the least.TO SEE PEOPLE FREELY ILLEGALLY TRADING THE PRODUCTS IN THE LOCAL MARKETS WOULD BE FRUSTRATING That market we went to was not a very prolic one when it comes to wildle. It was frustrating and again, not the first time and not the last time Ive seen wildle in markets... I think the frustrating thing is that the wildle trade is a very, very complex trade, and thats really now starting to become a focus in peoples minds because of the current situation that we face with coronavirus and the fact that its origins have probably come from the wildle trade.But regardless, that was definitely one of the points where I felt very low and very down afterwards because at that particular time I didnt have the authorities with me. And I dont have the authority and I dont have the place to be able to go into a wildle market and start taking wildle without the proper system to be able to back me up.So I had to walk away knowing full well that by the time Id informed the authorities and theyd been able to mobilise, the chances are the next day that those particular inidual animals would have not been there and not made it.YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BEARS AS INDIVIDUALS...When we talk about conservation, and when we talk about the wildle trade, and when we talk about bears as a species, it is ultimately about them as a species... but for me its also about them as an inidual.Because Mary the sun bear, when we confiscated her from the trafficker, or David and Jane, or any of the bears, they dont know that their species is now starting to become endangered in the wild andthis continues in another five years time it could be past the tipping point.What they know of is what they feel as iniduals, which is they feel fear and they feel stress and theyre hungry because quite often most of the bears that we come across are never fed properly. It comes down to balance. I want to help that animal as an inidual, but I also want to be able to help the bigger picture when it comes to species conservation.GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS SERIES I really feel, whether its organisations like Free The Bears or programmes like Bears About The House, for me its about having that respect and compassion and kindness towards the natural world and the animals that are part of that.The most important thing that hopefully will be the bigger context of the situation,we take one thing from it, it should be that we are completely interconnected to other species and the environment around us. If we dont treat that with respect, it will be to our detriment.Bears About The House starts on July  at pm on BBC Two."},{"url":null,"title":"author-patrick-baker-five-scotlands-evocative-wild-places","story":"THERE are certain places that exist at the edge of our collective memory. Ruins and relics which are scattered across Scotlandrsquos landscape, forgotten, overlooked and often hidden by dint of sheer geographical remoteness. I have come to think of them best described as wild histories. Wild, certainly, in that they are located in wilderness areas, but wild also in an almost anthropomorphic sense: feral, uncared for, mostly unknown or nameless, and outside the boundaries of public consciousness.When thought of in this way, the landscape of Scotland becomes a vast diorama: the setting for countless narrative scenes, lives and stories overlaid, some more vivid than others. These wild but often unseen histories define us more than any iconic building or national monument, for they are records of things inconsequential and commonplace. It is this compelling and contradictory mixture of secrecy and signicance that over the years some has led me to become fascinated with some particular wild places.THE GLEN LOIN CAVES, SUCCOTHAlthough I cannot say when or how I first became aware of the Glen Loin Caves, it feels like they have always been there, hard-wired into my imagination. Most people will never have heard of them, but I have come to think of them in near-mythical terms ndash a place of refuge for drovers, brigands, outlaws and even royalty.Among other claims, they were most famously the supposed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his routed army in  after his defeat at the Battle of Methven. More recently, the maze of fallen rocks on this Argyll mountainside was the focal point of a unique, sporting counterculture.It was here for almost two decades from the s that groups of working-class young people, mainly from the poverty-stricken tenements of Glasgow and shipyards of Clydebank, congregated to climb the huge rock walls of the Arrochar Alps.They created an almost permanent weekend residence in the caves. Small groups arrived at first, each with its own particular rules and hierarchies, then more established affiliations evolved. Clubs formed here whose names still resonate with modern mountaineers: the Ptarmigan Club and the infamous Creagh Dhu. The influence of these pioneering climbers was immense, providing a surge in climbing standards and techniques that was unequalled anywhere  at the time. They also redefined the sport, dismantling existing class barriers and creating a makesht society in the Glen Loin Caves whose values and ethics became imprinted on generations of climbers that were to follow.Yet the caves and their whereabouts have managed to remain largely unknown for decades. Hidden partly by the obscurity of the landscape, but also by an unwritten code of fraternal discretion.lsquoThe lad with the clinker-nailed boots and the rope in his rucksack who told me how to find the cave made me promise to keep the secret,rsquo wrote Alastair Borthwick in , in one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of the caves.lsquoI was to follow a track to a foresterrsquos cottage, pass through a gate . . . and there search for an old sheep fank. Behind it I should find a faint track leading up the hillside andI followed the scratches on the rock it led to, I should find the cave and good company.rsquoEven at close proximity, however, the caves are frustratingly hard to locate. In  it took the writer Rennie McOwan, an accomplished outdoorsman, several attempts to pinpoint the exact position of Borthwickrsquos earlier description. lsquoYou can trace these historic cavesyou know where to lookrsquo, McOwan advised matter-of-factly, lsquobut it can be both time-consuming, and exasperatingyou do not.rsquoTHE NAVVIESrsquo GRAVEYARD, NEAR KINLOCHLEVENAt the start of the th century, in a remote glen in the West Highlands, thousands of navvies were at work on a huge hydroelectric scheme: a massive civil-engineering project near Kinlochleven, which included the construction of the reservoir, a six-kilometre aqueduct and an aluminium-smelting plant.For some of the men that worked there all the inherent danger of their job would suddenly coalesce in a single instant. With a sudden evaporation of luck ndash the misplaced sledgehammer blow, a momentrsquos loss of balance or the abrupt death-strike of unseen rock-fall ndash lives were ended in the wind-torn reaches of the moor.They were laid to rest near where they fell, in a small, improvised burial ground situated below the steep walls of the reservoir. This was the place that the author Patrick MacGill described in his radicalsemi-autobiographical novel Children of the Dead End ndash the navviesrsquo graveyard. It is still bleakly visible in the middle of the vast moor: three rows of headstones sectioned off by a low picket fence, the wood weathered to bone-grey.Even at a distance, its appearance is surreal. It has a strangely filmic quality: dramatic and out of place, like a set design ready to be used in a High Plains western. The gravestones, which were made with concrete from the dam, sit low in the ground, blotched with lichen and listing at angles in the soil.A few have been etched with simple decorative borders, and some carry names ndash all either Irish or Scottish. One in particular stands out, the grave of a woman, buried alongside the men. It challenges perceptions of the place as an exclusively male working environment. The thought of both men and women working here suggests perhaps something more civilised, than the lawless encampment described in MacGillrsquos book ndash a settlement or even a community.Despite the lack of embellishments, the inscriptions on the headstones are exact: neat letterings carved with considerable care. The same effort has been applied to all of them, including one ndash an anonymous grave ndash which, in the absence of a name, simply has the words lsquonot knownrsquo traced delicately across its centre. The gesture is touching. The stonemasonsrsquo precise work, their attention to detail and unbiased craftsmanship, even for an unidentied colleague, still feels like an act of considerable compassion.BELNAHUA, THE SLATE ISLESThe Slate Isles take their collective name from their geological renown. Fine-grained slate rock is found in abundance here in several rich deposits and has been mined since prehistoric times. By the th century the area was held in such importance it was mentioned by Donald Monro, High Dean of the Isles, in his landmark account of the Western Isles.In the centuries that followed, small-scale mining evolved into massive commercial harvesting of the mineral resource. In , the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant recorded that slates of lsquomerchantable sizesrsquo were being exported in quantities of lsquoabout two million and a half . . . annually to England, Norway, Canada and the West Indiesrsquo.By the middle of the th century this number had grown as much as seven times, and the Slate Isles found themselves at the centre of a global industry, providing jobs to hundreds of workers and supplying roofing materials for buildings all around the world.All that, however, would change. A series of natural and economic calamities, beginning with a storm surge of epic proportions, rendered the mines unworkable and the area destitute. Large swathes of the population left, never to , and the land assumed a look of devastation, houses abandoned and machinery left to rust.The most beguiling of all the islands is the uninhabited Belnahua, the furthest outlier in the small archipelago. A ghost village now exists there rows of empty workersrsquo cottages that still look out over the slate quarry which has long since flooded to form a deep, stilled lagoon.I journeyed there by sea-kayak across some of Scotlandrsquos fastest tidal races, making landfall in front of hollow-eyed buildings with window and door spaces showing light-filled interiors.The best view comes from climbing up a prism-shaped knoll in the middle of the island. From up high you can see the structures that once housed the small community. As well as the terraced workersrsquo cottages, there are a scattering of other buildings: pump houses and engine rooms, coal sheds and outhouses. On the eastern side are two more substantial-looking buildings ndash a two-storey house and a bothy.What is most remarkable though is the slate mine itself now a single flooded quarry of dark water that fills the centre of the island like an ink well. The gouged area is so large that in places only a narrow boundary of land has been left to buffer against the sea.EL ALAMEIN REFUGE, THE CAIRNGORMSNo other mountain area in the British Isles can claim to have had such a large proleration of bothies and high-level shelters as the Cairngorms. By the mid-s, a constellation of these refuges existed across the range, providing a basic form shelter for climbers and mountaineers to overnight on their expeditions in and around the plateau.The names of the old Cairngorm sheltershave always held an undeniable mystique for me. They seem redolent of a bygone, pioneering era of mountaineering. A time, it seemed, when enthusiasm and exuberance appeared to outweigh adversity and a lack of proper equipment.Most of the shelters have long since disappeared: Bob Scottrsquos Bothy destroyed by fire, Jeanrsquos Hut, and the Sinclair Hut run into dereliction or dismantled the Curran and the St Valery demolished. There is one, however, that has for the most part been largely forgotten about. Situated at over , feet somewhere on the steep western flank of Strath Nethy, the El Alamein hut is dficult to find, it walls constructed entirely from rocks barely visible amid a hillside of boulders.The positioning of the El Alamein refuge was a mistake. It was never intended to be built on the northern spur of Cairn Gorm Mountain, tucked literally out of sight and notionally out of mind in a rarely ventured-to part of the Cairngorms. The story goes that its placement was a navigational error. Built by members of st Highland Division and named after one their most famous battles, a mix-up in grid references lead to its construction not on the high plateau, like its sister hut the St Valery, but on an incidental ridgeline.In , the El Alamein and the other two high-level shelters of the Cairngorm plateau became implicated in the Feith Buidhe disaster ndash to this day, the worst, single tragedy in British mountaineering history. Following recommendations of the subsequent fatal accident enquiry, a decision was made to remove of all three of the shelters. Their presence on the plateau was deemed an unacceptable risk. Notoriously hard to locate, it was thought they created a  sense of security, inviting the inexperienced and unprepared to rely unrealistically on finding their protection ndash an often impossible task in winter.After several years of highly publicised and emotive debate, two of the shelters were pulled down. But for whatever reason, the El Alamein never followed suit. Its obscurity and lack of purpose perhaps became the reason for its survival: a barely known mountain refuge, located high on a quiet ridgeline, where it remains to this day.INCHKEITH ISLAND, FIRTH OF FORTHBlack and brooding in the Firth of Forth, Inchkeith Island is easily seen, but often overlooked. I have flown over it many times. On homeward-bound planes which bank low over the coast, you get a gullrsquos eye view of the island.It gives you the chance to survey its complex, post-apocalyptic townscape: deserted roads and decaying buildings, greenery threading through concrete, shrubs emerging from the rubble. Itrsquos a contradictory but compelling mix. A strange scene of urban dereliction in an elemental and unconnected place.That the architecture and edices of dferent times could still exist so forgotten and untouched, yet so geographically close to Scotlandrsquos capital, seems paradoxical, but also makes perfect sense. For centuries, Inchkeithrsquos wild form and isolated position ndash a craggy, kilometre-long, hill-topped rock in the wide, storm-blasted waters of the Forth ndash has both alternatingly defined its importance and rendered it a landscape that can easily be cast aside.Over the centuries it has served a multitude of purposes. Fortress, garrison, farm, lazaretto, prison, religious settlement and even the venue for a bizarre linguistic experiment. As backstories go, it can certainly claim an eventful and troubled past, and more than conforms to the writer Patrick Barkhamrsquos contention that lsquoa few square miles of island loom far larger than the equivalent pocket of land on the mainlandrsquo.The same is also true for the other islands scattered in the Forth, the lsquoemeralds chased in goldrsquo of Walter Scottrsquos epic poem Marmion. Each, I have found out, have their own rich narratives, outsized stories that are much bigger than their contained landmasses would suggest. They are tales of human and natural history ndash warfare and piracy, extinction and regeneration ndash that are intimately entwined with the lives of people far beyond their immediate watery domains.One of Inchkeithrsquos most interesting histories involves its role as a staging post for an attempted invasion of Leith. On  September, a flotilla of privateer warships had reached Inchkeith Island and lay anchored off its shores waiting to attack the port. The small fleet was led by the infamous naval commander John Paul Jones, a Scot by birth who had joined the Continental Navy of the American Colonies and was wreaking havoc around Britainrsquos coastline. Jones was about to mount his offensive when he was suddenly stopped by an unexpected and ferocious storm. Leith was spared by the skin of its teeth, marking a curious historic footnote ndashperhaps the only time Scotland has ever been close to invasion by a military force of what would become the United States.The Unremembered Places: Exploring Scotlandrsquos Wild Histories by Patrick Baker is out now Follow @WildHistorianAs Scotlandrsquos wild places become accessible again, enthusiasm to discover wild histories should always be accompanied by the principle of lsquoleaving no tracersquo: please tread lightly, leave no litter, do not disturb historical relics and respect Scotlandrsquos natural environment."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Hurrah  The pubs are reopening     here  39 s why I love even the worst of them","story":"This drastic remedy would probably not meet with Health and Safety approval, yet Mr McFadden might have hit on a winning tactic, as the pubs reopen. ldquoPeople are like sheep, he said, explaining the fencersquos effectiveness.

This famous watering hole, in the depths of the borders, used to be the haunt of writers like James Hogg and Sir Walter Scott. One broiling summerrsquos day my husband, having trekked what felt like the entire Southern Upland Way, finally reached its doors. Sun-baked and sweaty, he entered the bar like a bedouin falling upon an oasis, and with the last of his strength ordered a pint of beer. The publican ndash dressed like a dentist of old, in a white lab coat ndash wordlessly poured his drink and shoved it towards him. When he began babbling his gratitude, and describing the arduousness of his passage over the hills, she cut him short. ldquoNobody told you to do it, she said.The British tradition of outrageously hostile hospitality stretches back long before Basil Fawlty. It seems some of us donrsquot merely tolerate curmudgeons behind the taps but actively enjoy being insulted. The title of Norman Balonrsquos memoir of his years as a Soho publican ndash Yoursquore Barred, You Bastards ndash sums it up. Balon was celebrated as Londonrsquos grumpiest landlord, treasured for his unaccommodating persona. The Coach and Horses, over which he presided irascibly for -plus years, was the haunt of the writer Jeffrey Barnard. His Low Le column in The Spectator was a droll but tragic depiction of a man whose every waking thought led to the next tipple. When Keith Waterhouse turned the column into the play Jeffrey Barnard is Unwell, he immortalised Balon as well as Barnard. These days, I see that The Coach and Horses claims to be the first London pub to offer vegan meals. For a brief spell it even enjoyed a nudist licence. What Balon would have thought about this development would likely be unprintable.Over the years Irsquove spent more hours in pubs than I care to remember, but while the occasional off-taking quip is amusing, serious rudeness makes me head where. Willie Ross, of the Oxford Bar in Edinburgh, was in a class of his own when it came to abrasiveness. Photos show him presiding over his fiefdom, with a face like a hanging judge and a fag in his mouth. Described as instilling ldquosomething close to a sense of terror in customers, he apparently wouldnrsquot serve the English or women. Food was also verboten. Legend has it that when one hapless customer, a QC, askedhe could see the menu, Ross took him by the arm and led him out into the street. Pointing up at the pubrsquos signboard, he said, ldquoWhere does it say f***ing restaurant .No fan of the Edinburgh Festival and its luvvies, he once put up a sign saying, ldquoClosed due to Festival. When I first visited, however, the Oxford Bar was under new management, and far more inviting. By this time Ian Rankin had placed it on the tourist map as Inspector Rebusrsquos local. The countless sightseers who troop into this literary landmark would have got a taste of an altogether grimmer Scotland had Ross still been in charge.The real-ale pub where I used to live was the ideal establishment. The owner had a wicked sense of humour, and tolerated peculiarities on both sides of the bar. On St Patrickrsquos Day hersquod offer a two-for-three deal on all drinks. Other than crisps and peanuts, food was not available, no matter how hard we pleaded. He did, however, allow taxi drivers to bring in their slow cooker after a morning sht, and ladle out chilli con carne while they played cards. In the early evenings, one bloke would bring in a cheese board, and invite everyone to pile in. A mountaineering bicyclist often arrived smelling of woodsmoke and handed out tinfoil parcels of delicious trout, cured in his garden shed. Another old-timer used to produce leeks from his allotment, which he passed beneath the bar in paper bags, like smugglersrsquo contraband. When one night I was cornered by a man who could bore for an hour without drawing breath, the landlord paraded around the crowded room, waving a white flag to summon a rescue party.In an era where the customer comes first, the days of martinets like Ross or the lady of the loch are numbered. I canrsquot say Irsquom altogether sorry. Yet although a good bartenderrsquos manner is part of what draws people back, they canrsquot be bland or dull. Itrsquos a demanding job, and a touch of authority and steel is essential. People capable of handling humanity at its most outspoken, vocal and occasionally insufferable, are rarely naturersquos sweet sherry. I like to think of those with the saltiest personalities as an acquired flavour, like a peaty Islay malt. Ideally, a publican sits midway between the two: a New Zealand sauvignon, perhaps, or dry GT.Itrsquos a job I certainly couldnrsquot handle, especially in a busy city centre. My husband recalls that our wedding ceremony in a Glasgow registrarrsquos office took less time than ordering a drink in the Horseshoe bar.

The UK Government will publish legislation on the rules that will govern the UK single market to replace the EU single market, which we leave in six months. This will replicate, in theory, the economic level playing field that used to be overseen by the trade regulators in the European Commission.:Opinion: Ian McConnell: Whether European Research Group chairman Mark Francois sees value of EU is neither here nor there amid this Brexit shamblesNow, in his time as a Brussels correspondent, Boris Johnson made his name by traducing these regulations. He pilloried Brussels bureaucrats trying to ban British prawn cocktail crisps, adjudicating on condom dimensions or the degree of curvature on cucumbers. This was mostly journalistic invention. However, there was an element of truth in his Bonkers Brussels stories.To create a single market you have to have common trading and hygiene standards,only to prevent countries using them as ldquonon-tarf barriers to free trade. So there is poetic justice in Mr Johnson now finding himself in the position of the maligned eurocrats and trying to dictate the self-same rules for Scotland through the ldquopower grab.Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon should dust down some of his riper columns. For Mr Johnson also railed against state aid laws that prevented countries supporting their key industries. Mr Johnson suggested that was just in the interest of German exporters. Now the PM is dictating state aid rules to Scotland ndash essentially that we shouldnrsquot have them.Ms Sturgeon calls this a ldquofull-scale assault on devolution. Nor is she willing to accept ldquomutual recognition of trading and health and safety standards regulations which might expose Scotland to American chlorinated chickens and hormone-fed beef.Rather like the unbent bananas, the chlorinated chickens are a bit of a myth, and unlikely to appear on British shelves. The UK Government negotiators have made that clear to their US counterparts.But the Cabinet Office Secretary, Michael Gove, has also made it clear that a new UK internal market regulatory body will call the shots on state aid. It will also alter regulations on food standards and the like without consent from the Scottish Government. So the chemical fowl do perform the politicalof reminding people that the Scottish Parliament does at present have, at least in theory, a veto power over things like health, environment, animal welfare. This is because these matters were not included in the powers reserved to Westminster under the  Scotland Act.Of course, Holyrood only exercised these powers on behalf of Brussels it did not actually set the trading standards or state aid rules itself. However, it did and does exercise a degree of latitude in applying the standards and allocating state aid.For example, the Scottish Government was able to funnel more than poundmillion to Amazon under Selective Regional Assistance and other grants. These are EU-compliant forms of state aid permitted in order to attract companies to unemployment black spots ndash in this case Dunfermline. Ms Sturgeon might be a little shy of referring to that particular exercise in state aid since it emerged that Amazon was paying less in tax per year than it was receiving in ious forms of UK Government subsidies. It was also paying workers rather less than the Scottish Governmentrsquos Living Wage.But the principle is clear: Scotland has a strong case to retain powers over state aid, and not just because of a narrow interpretation of the devolution legislation.In America, supposedly land of the free market, devolved jurisdictions have state aid policies that would delight Jeremy Corbyn. San Francisco gave tax breaks and subsidies to attract Twitterrsquos HQ that could never have been allowed in Europe. In Delaware you can set up a business and pay no tax at all.No one is suggesting that Scotland should become an international tax haven, of course. But it can make a strong case for continuing to have a role in state aid policy, in areas like ferry services to island communities or a public sector bid for rail franchises.Holyrood is also on firm ground insisting that it retains powers over food standards. Scottish beef producers are understandably worried about imports of cheap meat from non-EU countries. Salmon farmers have been getting stick from environmentalists over standards in their ponds, but things could become immeasurably worse were existing animal welfare and food safety standards to be relaxed.Of course, this is what ldquomutual recognition should mean in practice: flexibility on both sides. It would be very stupid for the UK Government to refuse to recognise ersity in trading standards across the UK. And not just in order to avoid y court actions over the Sewel Convention.The convention that the Scottish Parliament should pass a consent motion on any UK legislation cutting across its powers was effectively revoked by the UK Supreme Court in . The ldquospider lady Lady Hale and fellow judges ruled that the Sewel Convention had no statutory basis and didnrsquot limit Westminster sovereignty.

At the very least, Mr Gove should make sure that the nations and regions are properly represented on the new regulatory body.Further, on the new points-based immigration scheme outlined this week, there is a strong case for Scotland to be allowed to award extra points for certain occupations ndash like care work ndash where there is an unavoidable shortage. Mr Gove himself proposed this before the Brexit referendum.Mind you, Nicola Sturgeon might be wise to tone down criticism of the ldquoracist policy of Priti Patel.

Pick out the juicy tidbits. Is that not the tabloid way, the branch of journalism with which he is most closely associated Look closer, however, and all is not as it seems. The Farage story is fresh, but the Church tale was first aired at the Leveson Inquiry and the Succession point is mere observation. Yet that mix of modes, slipping between fact and fiction, objective and subjective, is the Murdoch way too.Hard man to pin down, Mr Murdoch. This three-part series, a sort of Dynasty without the shoulder pads, was the latest attempt to unravel the enigma, and it showed promising signs of having the chutzpah to go further than its predecessors. Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment.

The executioners wore masks and obeyed the rules of ldquosocial distancing except when they needed to get close enough to inject the pentobarbital.

The last man to be hanged here was Henry John Burnett, who murdered his girlfriends husband. As a child, Burnett spent time in borstals and later tried to kill himself the case also happened before legal aid, so he was defended by somebody with virtually no experience of criminal defence. He was executed in Aberdeen in , aged .If any good did come out of the case, it was that it probably expedited the abolition of the death penalty in Britain ndash it happened two years later. But whatrsquos striking is that, despite the abolition, public support for capital punishment was strong in this country and remains relatively high.

In the case of Labour, part of its traditional working class support is hard on criminal justice, and in the SNP, the less progressive wing of the movement partly explains the creation of new pro-independence parties led by voices whorsquove been sceptical on issues such as trans rights.:Mark Smith: Anti-Scottish  I think Irsquom finally facing up to my prejudiceWhat all this means is we should remember wersquore not really as progressive as we think we are and that, while support for the death penalty has dropped from about two-thirds in the s, it is still extraordinary that half the Scottish population thinks itrsquos a good idea for the state to kill people. They may even have a preferred method: injection, electrocution, who knows.We should also note that, although therersquos no realistic prospect of the death penalty ing in Britain ndash or in an independent Scotland for that matter ndash it has become a little bit easier in the last few months. As a member of the EU, the UK was banned from reintroducing the death penalty but now that wersquore out of the EU no such ban applies anymore. So, in theory, it could happena future government wanted it.The hope must be, surely, that Scotlandrsquos changing attitudes on capital punishment and other liberal issues such as sexuality would prevent anyto the death sentence. But itrsquos worth remembering that governments do not always follow public opinion. The death penalty was abolished in the s even though the vast majority of people supported it, so presumably the reverse could happen and a future government could ignore public opinion and reintroduce it.: Mark Smith: Take a good look at the Tories who support English independence because it is Scotlandrsquos story tooItrsquos also worth remembering that, although support for the death penalty has dropped since the s, it has dropped at a very slow rate. Yes, itrsquos   now, but think about this: therersquos a good chance that every second person in Scotland will look at the executions of Billy Wardlow and Daniel Lewis Lee during a global effort to save lives and think: good, justice has been served, job done.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

From my involvement I can confidently state that the one constant in this situation has been the rapidity by which the volume and quality of data relating to the virus has increased and knowledge and understanding of its impact has informed the need to adapt our response to reflect this.At the outset each country took its own stance relative to the scientic evidence available at the time. Inevitably this stance was clearly informed by politics and we can see the results of that by a comparison, albeit simplistic, between, for example, New Zealand and the United States.The situation in which we now find ourselves across the UK reflects this. At the outset the available science within the UK led the Westminster and the devolved governments to the same starting point. However, as the scientic evidence grew, Westminster chose one path while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland took a dferent approach which reflected the same principles as those countries throughout the world who sought to eliminate rather than contain the virus.The evidence now clearly suggests this path has been the more circumspect, while only time will tell whether it proves to be wholly successful. What is clear, however, is that the actions of the devolved governments have been taken based around a structured and strategic response to evidence rather than, as appears to be the case, a series of ill-considered reactions to prevailing political dynamics that seems to characterise the Westminster administration.It has also been the case that far from relying on \"common sense\" as promoted by the politicians, those tasked with ing the athletes to training have been extremely prescriptive about what constitutes good, and safe practice leaving no room for doubt as to what is required. While that may appear to be dictatorial and imposing on an iniduals freedom, in reality one inidual not complying with protocols can have a serious effect on everyone  around them.These are unprecedented times, calling for clarity and effective governance.

Nationalists came closer, much closer, than unionists like to admit to victory in the  independence referendum. Far from accepting that defeat, support for independence has grown steadily from that  percent base to at least a dead heat.And, although I think it is risky for nationalists to invest too much stock in any polling conducted during an unprecedented crisis such as coronavirus, there is little doubt that, in this snapshot in time, nationalists are winning. Even No voters think that Nicola Sturgeon is doing a good job.Scottish nationalism is in the jaws of victory. So why, three times in the last week alone, have dferent parts of the movement taken steps which risk snatching defeat Victory for nationalists is not a complicated route to chart. It has three elements: win a majority based on a clear manesto commitment at a Scottish Parliamentary election obtain agreement from the UK Government to allow a referendum to be held persuade enough  No voters to vote Yes.So the question for nationalists, it seems to me, should be lsquodoes what I am doing make any of these elements more or less likely to happen rsquo. If we look at the output from the nationalist community over the last week, the answer has to be lsquoless likelyrsquo.Let us take it in turn. The creation of another pro-independence party ndash the Alliance for Independence or AFI ndash has been discussed for some time amongst those seen as agitators against Ms Sturgeon. They are, very broadly speaking, more fundamentalist about the route towards a second referendum and independence, set against the gradualist and more consensual approach of the SNP.On the face of it, AFI is a clever concept, exploiting the SNPrsquos strength in constituencies, peeling off the wasted SNP regional votes, and scooping up a large proportion of the  regional seats.The legitimacy or otherwise of lsquoplayingrsquo the Additional Member Systemvoting method is for another column, but as an exercise in maximising the number of seats for pro-independence parties the AFI proposal has solid logic.However, this is not solely about electoral success in May. The entire purpose of the exercise is, I presume, to lay the foundation for a second independence referendum. However, without the consent of Westminster, nationalist parties could win  seats and there will still not be a second referendum.There remains a debate in the Conservative party about the granting of indyref. The official line remains that there will not be one. Wersquove had one, we said no, we meant it, you said ldquoonce in a letime and so on and so on.

On the fringes of the nationalist movement, yes, but nonetheless attracting national publicity. The  percent who voted No last time have, by definition, at least some affinity with the Union, and with England. It may be social, cultural, economic it doesnrsquot matter what it is, it matters that it is there. Irsquod place a bet that precisely none of the two million people who voted No in  will be persuaded by the Hazmat brigade. Indeed, it has more chance of pushing Yes voters the other way.Similarly, the decision by AUOB, a more mainstream nationalist group, betrays a lack of understanding of who lsquosoftrsquo Unionists are, and what they think.The -or-so percent of voters who might go either waythere is another referendum are, self-evidently, moderate, pragmatic, and unbiased. Their choice is likely to be clinical rather than emotional. They probably voted No last time because they felt the nationalist arguments on the economy were too weak, too left-wing.Tell me, then, how a march of thousands of highly committed, flag-waving leftist nationalists is going to persuade the persuadables If I were a nationalist, looking to achieve independence forthwith, Irsquod be sticking by the SNP strategy.

Here in the UK, we have also witnessed a signicant decline in our annual CO emissions compared to pre-lockdown levels.While it is highly questionable whether these specic benefits will be maintained, a longer-term environmental consequence of the pandemic is its likely impact on speeding up the global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. This transition, which was under way long before the pandemic took hold, is likely to be propelled forward as we emerge from lockdown and look to revive the global economy. It will be driven by a change in consumer behaviour as we enter the ldquonew normal and see increased pressure for nations to get serious about addressing environmental concerns.Many of the post-pandemic economic stimulus packages about to be introduced across the world will also be guided by environmental considerations, including Paris Agreement obligations. We can therefore expect a spike in measures, including funding for offshore wind projects, expanded rollouts of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, grants for development of clean aviation fuels and the further expansion of cycle works, to follow.Here in the UK, there is already signicant support within the business community for future government stimulus measures and corporate bailouts to take account of our net zero climate target. Wersquove already seen a group of  business leaders pressing the Government to align its economic recovery plans with the UKrsquos legislated target of net zero emissions by  at the latest. Meanwhile the UK Government is understood to be working on a net zero sector deal, which we expect to be announced later this year.This comes as we are witnessing a changing culture within the energy sector where major operators, including Total and BP, have announced high profile low carbon investments since the recent oil price crash. While a number of energy firms have cut their overall near-term investment due to current financial pressures, in many cases the reduction in this expenditure is far more signicant on oil and gas projects compared with those which are low carbon.The energy transition has never been about journeying entirely from fossil fuels to clean energy but rather finding a balancing point somewhere between the two. Fossil fuels still have an important role going forward as part of a wider energy mix. In addition, the petrochemicals industry will also remain relevant going forward ndash as an example the petrochemicals required for face masks and other PPE used in the fight against Covid- are not easily replaced. Similarly, as the infection risk falls and people resume travel, from an energy perspective we will see an initial increased demand for petrol and diesel in advance of longer term investment to promote electric vehicles.Although consumers may face higher energy prices in the short term, over time they will benefit from greater choice and easier access to the market through digitalisation and from the further development of domestically generated wind and solar power which empowers people to operate as energy producers.Overall we can expect to see a faster rise in the development and use of green energy due to the catalyst of the global pandemic which has indeed brought much adversity as well as opportunity.Norman Wisely is Aberdeen Managing Partner at international law firm CMS"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-doug-marr-era-male-leaders-maybe","story":"Itrsquos dficult to tie down the distinguishing qualities of statesmen women therersquos just something about them that creates trust and respect.

A public health campaign was thus born, and the first of many I think, in the Scots language.Whilst Irsquom not sure how far to the front of some peoplersquos heids government campaigns are after a few pints, most people seem to have quite enjoyed this foray into Scots. A cursory look on Twitter at the ldquokeep the heid hashtag confirms that, with someone from East Anglia saying it was the perfect phrase for these times, and another north of the border proclaiming that hersquod never felt so patriotic.The use of Scots somehow brings momentary respite to what has been a heavy, bruising time, it lightens our moods, makes us smile, whilst at the same time carrying an important message to behave ourselves. Therersquos something about ldquokeep the heid that feels inclusive, and is perhaps not quite as paternalistic as the UK governmentrsquos ldquoStay Alert slogan, although arguably they mean almost the same thing. Whatever the reasoning behind it, Sturgeon seems to have got it right with both choice of language and messaging.

It unies and ameliorates, strengthens and deepens those human bonds.But slogans in whatever language wont be enough to see us through the trials ahead.

I do go on public transport as much as possible. I do ride my bike everywhere I can.We take a trip to Doncaster once a year to visit our friend Stephanie and we drive to Coatbridge from Glasgow every second week. Other than that, she largely sits in the carpark patiently waiting a next outing.I used to take the train to Doncaster every year, incidentally, until the fares went up wildly. For several years you could get aticket for about pound but then it became cheaper to fly to Europe than to rail southwards, so it was Stella to the rescue.Wed get lost every year, usually going awry somewhere around Scotch corner. One year I was delighted to find a practical application for my English Lit degree. Entirely lost, I stopped at a service station and clocked a red rose above the entrance. A rose  War of the Roses!

When le started to slow down but we were still commuting in to the office, I started to drive to work every day due to, at first, a fear of coming in to close contact with people on the bus, and then due to reduced services.The bike was parked because I was having to carry a load of equipment back and forth, for boring reasons, and it was too heavy and didnt fit in my panniers. Friends who were still commuting did likewise, dropping public transport for the private car.While very much staying at home for the vast majority of the time, very rare trips that would normally be done on public transport have been done by car. Again, reduced services and reluctance to be close to strangers.As lockdown has eased, the car has become a focal point for allowing a slightto some normality. First it was drive thru food and drink outlets. Whereas you might previously have sat in, now driving through was the only option.Edinburgh and Glasgow city councils have now reintroduced parking charges, in an attempt to ease congestion and get back on track with carbon emission reduction aims while encouraging greener travel.This is the right thing to do, though it makes it tricky for workers while public transport is still reduced. It also reintroduces the conumdrum of how to encourage people to use our city centres and local high streets now that out-of-town shopping malls with their ample and free parking have reopened.Its not only commuting, shopping and dining that have become car-centric.Ato social and leisure activities is focusing on private vehicles too. There are drive-in comedy shows planned, drive-in movies and a drive-in gig - though this was cancelled due to concerns about localised lockdown restrictions.Its straightforward enough - being in a private vehicle is the most socially distanced place you can be while still enjoying pre-pandemic pursuits.Glasgows plans for a low emission zone in the city centre had made me start to think about what to do with my car. Is it more environmentally friendly to keep a relatively low emissions vehicle or to buy, say, an electric car but have that offset with the emissions generated producing it I hadnt started to look into that yet but had planned to, as well as trying to work outI could manage without the car and join a car club instead.Yet being in an emergency situation has turned all that on its head and made owning a vehicle, once again, the most attractive option, especially with the added boon of the tourism sector opening this week and the five mile travel limit lted.The oft repeated sticking point when pushing for increased levels of active travel has been the suboptimal public transport were faced with.Now, theres really no defence for public transport because its unarguably reduced. It wasnt good enough or joined up enough before, and now there is less of it.Our environmental concerns havent diminished during the Covid- pandemic, they are very much still there and very much in need of relentless, persistent addressing.Its now a bigger ask than ever before to urge people to embrace greener travel, an ask the transport minister made earlier this week. Reflecting on phase three of lockdown being the most dficult transition phase yet, Michael Matheson said, \"The obvious temptation for households with access to a car will be to take that option. However, we know many journeys are less than a few miles and could be covered via active travel, especially over the summer and autumn months.\"Using a car, though, isnt merely a temptation now. Its a common sense, understandable option for many. With a reduction in public transport and so many new car-based activities on offer, there are real additional issues of inequality for those households without a vehicle.The surge of people cycling in lockdown for leisure will, hopefully, be sustained and see those who are biking for exercise start commuting too.Id count myself as an active travel advocate but Im certainly going to have to wean myself back off driving as we move through the pandemic response. Car use is now predicted to rise to % of pre-covid levels. We dont want it any higher. Before lockdown there was so much will towards active travel - we need to be taking great strides towards that again.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

These will be the toilets at the Travel Centre and St Magnus Lane in Kirkwall and at the Pier Head and Ferry Road in Stromness – with more to follow over the weeks ahead.The council says each will have one ladies’ toilet, one gents’ toilet and an accessible toilet available for use.“Hygiene and physical distancing requirements mean that considerable work is needed at each site before the toilets open again,” said Hayley Green, OIC’s head of IT and facilities.“This means that it isn’t possible for us to open all of Orkney’s public toilets in one go.“You will notice quite a few changes inside and outside the toilets. Please follow the instructions we’re providing in order to minimise any risks to yourself and our cleaning staff.“Work is carrying on to re-open more public toilets over the next few weeks # keep an eye on social media and the OIC website for further updates.”OIC have also provided the answers to some frequently asked questions about the re-opening of the public toilets.We need to introduce quite a lot of physical changes to our public toilets in order to meet Scottish Government guidance. We are also having to arrange to clean them more often, and so we are discussing with our staff and contractors about how this will be done. This is why we can’t open all the toilets on the th, but we are aiming to have all public toilets open during August. There will be physical changes both outside and inside the toilets. You will be asked to follow physical distancing markers outside the toilet, and not all the facilities inside the toilet will be available. Because of this, please allow a little longer for your visit as you may need to wait for the toilets to be free. The toilets will need to be cleaned more frequently, and we will provide liquid soap for you to use to wash your hands, as well as a supply of cleaning products as required. We would ask everyone to please leave the soap and the cleaning products in the toilets for the next person to use # please do not take them away with you. There is still some element of risk around using public toilets, and that is why we are having to make the changes described above. We are following Scottish Government guidance, which can be found here: https:www.gov.scot publications coronavirus-covid--public-and-customer-toilets-guidance pages hygiene-measures We have carried out risk assessments for each site and also a general risk assessment for the process of cleaning the toilets during the pandemic. All of our staff are being briefed on any changes to their working practices and equipment, including PPE where needed, will be provided. Trade Unions have been provided with the risk assessments and given the chance to make any comments. We are currently working with our cleaners, including those who do relief cleaning for the council, as well as our contractors to assess their availability. If we need more cleaners, we will be looking to advertise this and recruit folk over the next few weeks.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland.Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian opened up to the public on June , with a number of new measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. These include mandatory advance booking to avoid crowding and queues, a oneway system around the zoo, hand-washing stations and the cancellation of any activities which involve the public touching or feeding the animals. The soft play area and restaurant are also closed, but food kiosks are still open.Keeper talks have been cancelled, but several videos of the talks have been made available online.The zoo is currently opening at about one third of capacity to ensure space for social distancing, and owners say they will monitor the situation and review measures in place after the first couple of weeks. “It’s been good so far, the feedback we’ve had has been really positive,” said assistant manager Gary Curran. “The past few months have been quite dficult financially, so it was a relief to be able to open safely.” He added: “We’re looking forward to the rest of the summer and hopefully some more good weather! “People really enjoy it here and they’re having a good time so far.”Summer is here and our colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens beckon. Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors.To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream.And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands.Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling.Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for re opening tourism.To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the website visitbritain gb en knowbefore-you-goWith many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Scottish tourism bosses have teamed up with Tourism Northern Ireland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK Visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening.The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a COVID- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join.UK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston said: “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely.“This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance. “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.”VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead, said: “We are pleased that after a very dficult few months Scotland’s tourism industry are starting to welcome visitors.“However, it’s important to remember that things may be a little dferent now, there may be reduced facilities available orbusy, a greater need to follow physical distancing restrictions to protect yourself and others. “Planning and researching will also become an important part of the holiday experience and we really want visitors to ‘know before they go’ when it comes to travel checking what is open and pre-bookingrequired.”To obtain the mark businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  https:goodtogo.visitbritain your-business-good-to-go-scotland including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark for display in their premises and online. Businesses across the UK are assessed according to their respective national guidance including the social distancing and cleanliness protocols that must be in place. vw, px\"  For more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But he soldiered on to complete his first nine holes in an estimable  shots.Goodness only knows what happened at half time but he required only  shots for the second nine, a gross score of  and a nett  which was to be the joint lowest nett score recorded during the whole weekend.Great stuff there and with a higher handicap than all those around him and very much in contention he has nothing to lose in the second and final round.Best wishes Ross-great play!Of course that#s only one round gone but with one still to play the likeliest contenders to depose those already occupying the qualying positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Mr Hancock told the Commons there had been a problem with swabs, but there was no suggestion test results were affected.Mr Hancock told MPs: We#ve identied some swabs that are not up to the usual high standard that we expect, and we#ll be carrying out further testing of this batch as a precautionary measure.And while we investigate further, we#re requesting that the use of these Randox swab test kits are paused in all settings until further notice.Clinical advice is that there is no evidence of any harm, the test results are not affected.There is no evidence of issues with any of our other test swabs, and there is no impact on access to testing.Shadow secretary of state for health John Ashworth asked Mr Hancock what was wrong with the Randox test kits - and how many had been used.Is there a health risk to anyone who has been tested with these kits  the senior Labour MP said.And how many people have these unsafe kits been used on and why weren#t the certications checked before these kits were used These kits tend to be used in many care homes.We want care home residents to be tested regularly, we want care home staff to be tested regularly - can he guarantee that those care homes will now get alternative kits rapidly Mr Hancock replied: The reason is that they had a CE stamp and upon investigation of the certication of that stamp, the certication was not forthcoming, and therefore physical checks were done and we found that the swabs weren#t up to the standards that we expect.This is limited to the Randox element of the testing system, not the broader testing system that we have.And I explained the clinical position, which is that there is no evidence of any harm having been done and that there is full access to testing because we have plenty of other test kits available.A statement on the Randox website said: As an immediate precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended distribution of home sample collection kits using one particular batch supplier of swabs.This is a temporary measure and does not apply to our private business, which uses a dferent supplier of swabs.Test results from Randox kits are not affected.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendHeartbroken husband of Co Tyrone crash victim Andrea Hackettpays emotional tribute to #love of his le#Limavady Covid- spike linked to microphone passed around at house party karaoke sessionGrave of murdered Warren Crossan vandalised in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On  occasions, the outward andflights were within a matter of hours. The European Arrest Warrantstated that Mr Adams was stopped at Belfast International by Border Force officers on May ,  travelling with only hand luggage. The warrant said Mr Adams confirmed to Border Force officers that he had packed the bag himself.When asked whether anyone had given him anything to take out of the country, he replied: Yes, €,.The warrant stated that Mr Adams was interviewed under caution on May ,  and made no comment to questions asked in relation to the cash, his personal background, his employment status and financial position. Counsel for the State, Aoe Carroll BL, previously made an application to the court for Mr Adams# surrender and asked the court to let the chips fall where they may. She submitted that the respondent#s objections to surrender were speculative, vague, unsupported by evidence and were subject to innumerable iables so that the court could not refuse surrender on foot of same. Ms Carroll said she was satisfied surrender to the UK would not give rise to an unfair trial. She said nothing in the warrant was defective, nothing arose in relation to Brexit as the status quo remains in place, so surrender was not prohibited.Furthermore, Ms Carroll said thatan order for surrender was made against Mr Adams, she would be asking the court to postpone handing him over to the authorities in Northern Ireland until domestic proceedings had been determined.The court has heard that the respondent#s position was complicated by the fact that he has been ed for trial before the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on separate money laundering charges, and his trial is due to take place in Dublin in June . Mr Adams had contested his surrender at the High Court, with his lawyers saying that he should not be extradited to Northern Ireland due to Brexit. Counsel for Mr Adams, Paul Comiskey O#Keeffe BL, had argued thathis client was convicted and sentenced in the Republic first, there would be an infringement of his rights to a fair trial in Northern Ireland in the future.He claimed this is because the UK would no longer be in the transitional period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the European Union. He further submitted that there was a real risk that the fundamental rights of the respondent would not be respected. Ordering his surrender to the UK yesterday, Mr Justice Paul Burns said he was satisfied that the extradition of Mr Adams was not prohibited by part three of the European Arrest Warrant Act . In light of the domestic offences brought against Mr Adams, the judge postponed his surrender to the UK until a later date.He remanded him in custody until July , .

After the club announced its formation it was inundated with interest.East Belfast men#s side faces St Michael#s Magheralin today, with the ladies# team taking on Saval tomorrow.The new club has rekindled memories of former club St Colmcille#s which really lit the GAA torch in the east of the city.St Colmcille#s was initially founded in the Ballyhackamore area in the late s before going out of existence in the s, only to resurface in the s in the wake of Down#s All-Ireland winning feats in  and .

My kids love coconut and white chocolate and my wee girl has Rice Krispies every day for breakfast. And I just thought Cadbury#s don#t really have a bar that has coconut in it, she explained.It was also a case of second time lucky for the BT telecoms employee. She previously entered her recipe idea, but was not selected.The first time I had entered the same bar and never heard anything, until I got an email to say I hadn#t been chosen. But I thought I#m going to enter that again. So probably last August I picked the three same flavours, she recalled.Then last September or October I got an email from Cadbury#s to say that I was down to the final . I just thought: #Is this a joke #The -year-old said she was shocked and delighted to then learn she had been selected as one of the three finalists who would travel to England to pay a visit to Cadbury#s headquarters in Bournville and witness their recipes being made into chocolate bars.I just couldn#t believe it. The smell of chocolate when you get in there... it just hits you. It#s amazing! I met the team and the other finalists. I had a brilliant wee day, she said.Going up against Gillian#s Coconutty is #Out of the Blueberry#, which has blueberry flavoured nuggets and white chocolate-coated cereal balls, and #Crunchy Honeycomb#, a mix of milk chocolate and caramel flavoured fudge cubes, chopped hazelnuts and honeycomb pieces.Gillian said she loved popping into the supermarket to see the bar on sale for the first time. It#s very exciting. Already I#ve had loads of people tagging me on Facebook, saying that they can#t wait to try the bar, or they#ve already tried and loved it, she added.Having tried it, I recommend taking a couple of bites, that way you get the full impact of the coconut.The chocolate bars are exclusive to buy in Tesco until July , when they go on sale at other retailers. At that stage, added Gillian, three mystery celebrities will champion each of the flavours online. I did get a buzz seeing it on the display, she said. The kids are over the Moon, saying: #Are you famous now, mummy  And I say: #I wouldn#t go that far, but everyone knows my signature now#.The overall winner will be decided by a public vote at www.cadburyinventor, which accounts for % of the vote, with the remaining % split between other online polls and sales.

children about computer programming during a visit to the Science Museum  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe Queen speaks with children about computer programming during a visit to the Science Museum By Laura Elston, PA Court ReporterJune   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Queen’s le has been steeped in tradition, but she has kept up with the vast technological advances during her reign of nearly  years.In a royal first, the -year-old has taken part in her first ever official video conference call as part of her public duties, following in the footsteps of other royals as engagements have gone online during the coronavirus pandemic.In her first televised Christmas broadcast in , she spoke of the “speed at which things change around us”.The grainy black and white picture of a young Elizabeth, dressed in a shimmering gown with a string of pearls around her neck, epitomised a signicant step for the royal family.It was one of the first strides taken by the monarch to ensure she was up to date with her ever-changing nation.The Queen has seen the advent of colour television, mobile phones, the internet and social media.Under her command, television cameras were allowed inside Westminster Abbey for the first time to film her coronation, although she had initial reservations.Five years later, the Queen made the first ever trunk call in the United Kingdom.Speaking from Bristol, she called the Lord Provost of Edinburgh  miles away.The call lasted two minutes, five seconds and cost d .When email technology was in its infancy, the Queen became the first monarch to send one of the electronic messages in  during a visit to an Army base.But the Queen continued to stick with traditional methods of communication such as letters and telegrams.Her own website, which began as www.royal.gov.uk, was set up in  during a visit to Kingsbury High School in Brent, north west London.However, it was reported that the Queen took some time to acquaint herself with certain devices.In , she is said to have told Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, that she had not yet used a computer.She later ensured that her household had embraced the internet and other major advances.The Queen is said to have had a BlackBerry in the past which she used to check her emails on the move – on the advice of her most technically savvy son, the Duke of York.Her grandchildren have helped in keeping her up to date with the latest technological trends.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie explained the concept of video sharing on YouTube before the British monarchy launched its own channel on the site in .In , her annual Christmas address was also sent as a podcast for the first time.She personally uploaded a video onto YouTube during a visit to the Google offices in London in .In , she sent an email to  young people from across the world who wrote blogs about their lives and their experiences of the Commonwealth – which was celebrating its th anniversary.The Queen strode into the social media sphere and allowed aides to create a Facebook page and Twitter and Flickr accounts, and then an Instagram account.She has also owned a number of iPods – one reportedly given to her as a gt by then US president Barack Obama and another from the Duke of Cambridge – which were said to contain classical music, including the Last Night Of The Proms.But the impact of changing technology has not always welcomed by the monarch.She reportedly said she found it strange to be greeted by a sea of mobiles when out on engagements as members of the public attempted to take her picture on their camera phones.US ambassador Matthew Barzun told Tatler magazine that the monarch essentially told him she missed eye contact.The Queen also voiced her concerns that children were being attracted to computer games and e-books.Author Joanne Harris said after attending an investiture: “She asked me what I thought about e-books and computer games and said that she feared that children were playing with those more than they were reading books.”In October , the Queen passed a new technological milestone when she sent her first tweet – to mark the opening of a new Science Museum gallery.It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting.Elizabeth R.— The Royal FamilyOctober , Touching a tablet screen, the monarch posted the pre-typed message via the royal family’s official Twitter account.It read: “It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.”The message was retweeted more than , times.But, in keeping with one of the downsides of social media, it also attracted instant abuse from Twitter trolls.“We saw some tweets with profanity but that is just the nature of the format,” a Buckingham Palace spokesman acknowledged.I am most grateful for the many digital messages of goodwill I have received and would like to thank you all for your kindness. Elizabeth R.— The Royal FamilyJune , The monarch also tweeted her thanks for all the “digital messages of goodwill” she received to mark her official th birthday in  – again signing off as Elizabeth R.In , she shared images on Instagram for the first time, also at the Science Museum.We had an incredible day today welcoming Her Majesty to the museum. The Queen posted on Instagram for the first time and announced our new exhibition: Top Secret. https:t.co HfNuzEO pic qAjJjrx— Science MuseumMarch , Touching an iPad screen, she posted photos on the official royal family account of a letter from th century inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage to Prince Albert.PAMost ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Covid- cluster outbreak found in NI town linked to house gatheringPerfect match: Ulster star Jacob Stockdale gets engaged to old school friendHeartbroken husband of Co Tyrone crash victim Andrea Hackettpays emotional tribute to #love of his le#Limavady Covid- spike linked to microphone passed around at house party karaoke sessionGrave of murdered Warren Crossan vandalised in west Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Middleton said: ‘‘The restrictions placed on pregnant women and their partners at the height of the first wave of Covid- demonstrated the serious threat posed by the virus and the disruption it caused to even the most cherished aspects of le in Northern Ireland. The guidance that took effect on  July was therefore extremely welcome, once again placing the onus on Trusts to facilitate birth partners seeking to accompany women to a range of maternity appointments. This included, but was not restricted to, dating and anomaly scans, induction of labour, the duration of labour, for birth, and visits to antenatal and postnatal wards. googletag.cmd.push I am becoming increasingly concerned that these rights have not been restored in a consistent or fair fashion. Whilst some Trusts appear to have honoured the guidance in full, the Western Trust have been limiting relaxations to -week scans only. This has led to a perception of a double standard. It is wrong that some birth partners are granted greater access than others simply because of where they live. Every pregnancy and every partner should be treated equitably and fairly. I would urgently call on the Health Minister to take steps to recty these concerns and issue clearer guidance.’’ googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Artists and the entertainment industry as a whole have come under immense pressure since the crisis forced the closure of business and mass cancellation of events in . Derry is a city with a deep-rooted musical heritage and over recent years a superfluity of talent has emerged, each of them dferent, but making their own mark in the industry. Amongst the current crop, you’ve got young established singer-songwriter SOAK, alternative pop artist ROE, the ambient soundscapes of Elma Orkestra, three-piece punk rockers TOUTS, indie folksters Reevah and PORTS, fuzzed up alt-rockers Waldorf  Canon and all female pop-rock courtesy of CHERYM. googletag.cmd.push Then there’s the masterful Our Krypton Son, rockers Wood Burning Savages and resurgent local legends Red Organ Serpent Sound - whose gigs were once described by Eamonn McCann as ‘low instinct, high art and so sexy’ they are ‘reserved sins in certain dioceses’. Unfortunately, those musicians have been unable to entertain audiences since March, except via Zoom, which is no substitute for the interactive and much more personal live experience. For musicians, performing is their leblood, it is not only what they love to do but live shows are the most dependable source of income. Leading artists in the country recently wrote a letter to the Department for Communitiesin a plea to provide urgent financial support to save the local music industry. googletag.cmd.push It is not only the musicians but the likes of producers, sound engineers, stage crew, management, live venue staff, photographers and freelance workers in the industry who are struggling. ‘STALLED’ Speaking to the Derry News, PORTS bass player and vocalist, Steven McCool, shared the dficulties experienced during lockdown but also about the welcome prospect of festivals and gigs on the horizon as restrictions have eased. He said: “At the start of the year we had begun working on a release schedule for our first new release in four years. “This includes, making music videos, touring etc. We had been finishing the last few songs of our next album. Then came the pandemic. “All our plans were stalled. We couldnt releasewe couldnt tour. We couldnt get together to finish the album or music videos. “We play live to build up the finances to release new music so that was another wall for us. “As things have started to open up, we have been able to roll out a bit of a schedule again and with Stendhal Festival going ahead, we can use that to coincide with a release. “Hopefully now as things start to open up we can get back on-board and out playing again.”  Hannah Richardson vocalist and guitarist in CHERYMechoed Steven’s view saying it’s ‘definitely been a dficult’ time for musicians. “With no furlough, no other source of income and a lot of uncertainty surrounding when it’s safe for us to get back to work,” she explained. A grant from Help Musicians NI at the start of lockdown her going for a while, Hannah said. “Spoty and the Arts Council have also been trying to issue grants to musicians which is extremely helpful but nothing compared to what we would be bringing inwe were allowed to work, especially now around festival season. “I just hope the live music scene is able to sustain itself once we see the other side of this and hope people continue to support local musicians and music venues so we can get back as quickly and safely to doing the thing we love most,” she added. Aoe Boyle, known by her stage name Reevah , had been planning to embark on her first headline tour to accompany the release of her EP A Dferent Light in April  May, followed by a busy summer of gigs and festivals. All of these plans have now been put on the back burner. As things stand the future for the arts is very uncertain, she explained. As anindependentartist the financial impact has been quitedevastatingand has affected not only our plans for the immediate future but for the next year. However, were so aware of the vast number of artists who are in a similar or even worse positions so are trying to remain as positive as possible about the future.  SOCIAL DISTANCING Stendhal Festival captured the attention of a worldwide audience after announcing the first socially distanced festival in Northern Ireland on August - aptly named ‘UNLOCKED’. It will take place at Ballymully Cottage Farm in Limavady where numbers will be limited but the audience will be treated to the very best talent on the island as well as beer gardens, delicious food and ‘perhaps best of all, over  acres of socially distant outdoor scenic countryside to enjoy’. Most festivals have however cancelled and are already trying to regroup for next year. Bars have also begun to reopen but in an effort to maintain social distancing live music has been actively discouraged. Theatres will open their doors at the end of the month but with large gatherings prohibited and social distancing mandatory for the foreseeable future there are uncertain times ahead. Strength N.I.A and Red Organ Serpent Sound frontman, Rory Moore, said it came as a ‘hefty blow’ to find out that all of their shows were cancelled for . “Live shows go hand in hand with releasing new music and sustaining oneself as a musician both financially, spiritually and emotionally. “It has been a pretty hefty blow. But working alone and self-isolation is something I have been used to for many years, the abnormality of the situation is something that comes with the turf of being a songwriter and performer,” he reflected. “Radio and social media are very important at this time for sustaining a career in music. “We hope that our fan base will pre order our album that is set for early release in  and fingers crossed we will be out playing again towards the middle of next year.” GOVERNMENT RESPONSE The Department for Communities said it is aware of the ‘immensely challenging’ situation currently facing the local music industry. The department has been in consultation with local industry representatives and further discussions are planned in the near future. In advance of the reopening of theatres and seated venues, the DfC is working in partnership with the Arts Council NI and key stakeholders, with officials having established a Consultative Arts and Culture Recovery Forum to help them in assessing the priorities for funding the sector in its entirety. A spokesperson said: “We are currently working at pace to develop our plans to ensure the future viability and resilience of the sector. These will be published as soon as possible. “The Arts Council NI currently have open funding programmes for both inidual artists and organisations. “Theatres have been provided with an indicative date for opening of  July. It is, however, recognised that it will be some time before venues such as theatres can operate as normal.” “There are a number of reasons for this. A number of venues have indicated that it will not be economically viable to open while social distancing remains in place. “We also need to consider the additional requirements for live performances including social distancing back stage and on stage, singing and wind instruments etc. “The Arts Council also are working with the sector to develop specic guidance for reopening theatres. This should be released shortly.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Many attractions are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and prebooked time slots, so the UK Government recommends looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations you plan to visit before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. To make your days out as enjoyable as possible, we encourage you to plan your trip in advance and to check all of the important facilities and attractions, while looking after our great outdoors. To ensure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, here are a few simple steps to help make planning easy. When planning your trip, check that important facilities – like toilets and car parks – are open before you travel so you’re not caught short. If you have an attraction in mind, please check online to seeyou need to pre-book a time slot. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem that you can brag to friends about. Keep two metres apart from anyone outside your household where you can. This applies to walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing too. Wear a face covering at all times when on public transport like buses, trains, taxis and minicabs.  Take time to know before you go Make sure you have a bank card because many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments and you don’t want to miss out on that ice cream. And take hand sanitiser with you – you don’t know where will be open for you to wash your hands. Leave the car behind where possible and visit attractions by walking or cycling. Please remember that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. To help you enjoy summer safely, please check the respective official sources for information prior to travelling by using the visitbritain website. Mark that shows we are good to go in Northern Ireland With many of our favourite attractions now beginning to reopen their doors, Tourism Northern Ireland has teamed up with VisitScotland, VisitEngland and VisitWales to come up with a way for people to check whether they are “good to go”. The We’re Good To Go initiative was developed jointly by the four UK visitor agencies. The UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark will provide a “ring of confidence” for visitors as the tourism sector works towards reopening. The We’re Good To Go mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective Government and public health guidance, have carried out a Covid- risk assessment and checked that they have the required processes in place, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. The scheme is free to join. “I want to encourage the public to experience a great holiday this summer and be confident that they can do so safely. This new industry standard will show people that tourism businesses, destinations and attractions are adhering to the guidance, saidUK Government tourism minister Nigel Huddleston.  READY: We’re Good To Go in Northern Ireland “It puts safety first and is an important move in getting this industry back up and running.” Tourism Northern Ireland chief executive officer John McGrillen said: “The rolling out of a UK wide industry standard and consumer mark is good news for the many tourism businesses across Northern Ireland who are gearing up to reopen their doors in the coming weeks. “They will be putting every possible measure in place to operate safely and provide reassurance to staff and customers alike that they have complied with official health guidance.” “We are acutely aware of the dficulties faced as the tourism sector reopens and the challenges ahead as we rebuild. However, we are confident that with the right measures in place and with ongoing support, the tourism industry in Northern Ireland can regain lost ground andto growth. “We have been delighted to partner with the national tourism agencies in Wales, Scotland and England to create a common approach. To obtain the mark, businesses must complete a self-assessment through the online  goodtogo.visitbritain, including a check-list confirming they have put the necessary processes in place, before receiving certication and the We’re Good To Go mark. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCP-boqqGOoCFVHHQodAIExg\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\"    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The campaign, run by Retail NI, is part of ‘Independents’ Month’, which celebrates the ersity of independent retail in Northern Ireland. County Derry has a wide range of independent retailers in its town centres of Maghera and Magherafelt, as well as the surrounding villages and towns. Customers can say thank you to their favourite retailer by lending them their vote, while there is also an opportunity to recognise efforts made by retailers during the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Cathal Mallaghan, encouraged residents to engage with the campaign. “The Mid Ulster district is renowned for its niche selection of independent retailers right across our five town centres and villages,” he said. “Following the extremely dficult and uncertain  months these retailers have experienced, we owe it to them to get behind them and not only cast our vote but to also illustrate our support in numbers by ing to our towns and villages and shopping local. “Many retailers went way above and beyond what was expected to continue to provide the excellent service we were accustomed to even in the most testing of circumstances. googletag.cmd.push “Now we are on the road to recovery I would call on all Mid Ulster residents to ‘reconnect with retail’ and rediscover our towns and villages, not only on Independents’ Day but all throughout the year, our local retailers depend on it.” Votes can be cast online until noon on Friday, July .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greyhound tells the story of aUS NavyCommander on his first war-time assignment in command of a group of vessels defending a merchant ship convoy crossing the Atlantic. The convoys destination is Liverpool, a city which also played a key role in the war. The film was released this week on Apple TV and Derry gets a number of mentions in it. This is being seen as recognition of the importance of Derry to the allied forces during the war. Its importance increased massively after the US entered the conflict. googletag.cmd.push As Derry was the first major port in Europe for ships travelling from America, it was seen as a vital location. Thousands of US soldiers were based in Derry during the war, living in several camps built in the city. During World War , Germany deployed a large number of submarines into the Atlantic to disrupt convoys of supply ships travelling between the US and Britain. Although the US convoys were protected by shore-based military aircraft when sailing near the shore, most of the voyage was in theMid-Atlantic area, known as the Black Pit beyond the range of Allied air support, where the only protection for the convoy were the assigned naval escorts. googletag.cmd.push In Greyhound, Tom Hankss character, CommanderErnest Krause, is in charge of the operation to escort a convoy of  Allied ships headed toLiverpool. The films focus alternates between the combat between the escorts and U-boats. Greyhoundwas initially scheduled to be released in cinemas in June but was delayed due to theCOVID- pandemic. The distribution rights were then sold toApple TV which released the film digitally last weekend.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One of the most familiar faces in youth football in Derry, McLaughlin has seen it all and done it all since taking the reins at the club in the early s, and in his time there has, with the help of others, elevated Celtics standing in the town to considerable heights. Yet with his partner Aisling, children Niamh , Cara , Caolan , Aaronand Rionato look out for, a degree in Community Youth Work and a job with Hillcrest Trust, Eamons plate is more than full. googletag.cmd.push The recent th anniversary celebrations of the club, plus the Covid- lockdown, gave the -year old plenty of time to reflect on both his past, and his future. So it was that McLaughlin took to Facebook earlier this week to announce his retirement, prompting hundreds of messages of support and congratulations. “It was a really dficult decision,” he admitted. “The timing however has been right for me and my family and the club. “I have been involved for  years and we have never been in a healthier position. We have more coaches than we have ever had, I think around  or  and in the last months, we have put a new committee in place, so we are in a really strong position. With that I felt the time was right for me.” googletag.cmd.push Its all a far cry from the day when he was thrust into the top position at the club, just  years of age and with little experience of coaching. “We were in the middle of a season and we had three or four matches in the league and we still had a cup run,” he recalled. “I was  years of age and I was helping Mousey Gallagher out and when he stepped away I was thrown into the deep end because there was no-one  there. “We kept it going and the likes of Oxy and Damien Doherty gave me a hand to fulfil the fixtures. We actually reached a cup final that season, but we were beaten - by Ashfield in the Brandywell. It was a brilliant season – I was hanging around with the boys as well as managing them – boys like Ryan Coyle, Eamon Morrow and Colm Fleming and a lot of those boys are now back coaching at the club, so its gone full circle for a lot of those boys as well as myself. There are so many sides to running a successful football club – but at its heart is the development of youngsters, on and off the pitch, and it is here especially where Top of the Hill has excelled according to McLaughlin. “The talent in Derry is unbelievable and thats one of the reasons I have always stuck by it,” he continued. “Its been great to see. Top of the Hill came in  years ago, but clubs like Oxford, Trojans and Don Boscos were already established. The talent is out there. For me, hand on heart, I got as much enjoyment from seeing a young fella who never got a kick as I do as someone lting a cup. Its about development. “Were slightly dferent to most clubs - because were living on the Interface, its more than about football. Im a youth worker as well so Ive always tried to tie the two in together. At this time of year we would have had trips and interventions to keep young people off the streets and away from rioting. “I got a text the other day from a young fella in Claudy saying that, more than football, he missed the trips we would do through The Whistle and Hillcrest. Its brilliant to hear that its not just about football because there are only so many young fellas who will make it as footballers. Its the community spirit and its the family atmosphere and I hope that continues on. Thats a big thing for me.” Celtic have had their share of big names come through their ranks in McLaughlins time – Rory Holden , Josh Daniels, Michael McCrudden and Darren McCauley some of those to build careers in the game.  Current Derry City midfielder Jack Malone also has his roots in Top of the Hill and McLaughlin admits that seeing a player reach his potential is the best kind of reward. It was in fact, McCruddens transfer to Newcastle United  years ago, coinciding with the tragic death of friend and fellow coach Keith Roddy, which lit a fire in McLaughlin. “Michael, at  or , was the first ever Top of the Hill Celtic player to go across the water,” he explained. “At the same time, in , Mickeys mentor, Keith Oxy Roddyhad died, and at that point I made the conscious decision that Im grabbing this by the horns and take the club where it needs to be, with the help of the likes of Paddy Logue, Higgs, Gerard Dunlop and boys like that.  “There were a very small amount of coaches but we had teams at every age group. You were out five or six nights a week. In the last two or three years, that has changed because now we have two or three coaches at every age group. I dont know for the le of me how Jon Clford and boys like that did it on their own. They deserve every credit that they get. “When I was starting out, boys like Jon Clford and Noel Crampsey, thats the boys you spoke to and asked advice of. Even though they were your competitors on the pitch, they wrere all in it for the same reasons, and they guided me, but no-one more so than Mickey Hutton in the DD. Any problems that I had ever with football, he was at the end of the phone, and the support that the DD have given us as a club hasnt gone unnoticed over here.”  is the first year that the Foyle Cup has not run in the city since its inception in , and while it is a loss for every club throughout the city, McLaughlin cannot wait for its– with the tournament holding a special place in the Top of the Hill calendar. “We try to get at least one team in every age grouppossible,” he said. “Some teams arent great, some are better than others, but they still get the opportunity to play in the Foyle Cup, and that, for me, is amazing. If youre winning - or getting beat -, your family are there supporting you during the Foiyle Cup, savouring the atmosphere and meeting new people. The buzz about the whole city throughout the week is phenomenal.” His time with Top of the Hill, for now, has reached an end, but the green and white will remain in his blood, and when football s, he will likely be the first on the sidelines cheering on his team. “Top of the Hill has been my le for  years, without a shadow of a doubt,” he stated.  “Its meant absolutely everything and will continue to mean everything to me. “It has given me some amazing memories and it will always be one of the proudest things that Ive done in my le. “Without the help and support of so many people – even the likes of my mother and sister, it all runs in their veins. Seeing the club celebrate its th anniversary last year probably sparked off my thinking that maybe it was time to move this on. The Covid thing gave me time to reflect and think – we are in a healthy spot at the minute and we need to have every faith in the boys who are going to take up the baton and run with it. “The amount of coaches we have now is credit to where people see us. You mightnt be as big a club as Tristar or Oxford, but were well up there. The respect that Top of the Hill Celtic has throughout the city is phenomenal.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels. But he has no intention of doing so.His next project will be making a model of the SS Bereby, a British merchant steamer built in  and owned by the Elder-Dempster Line.In , the vessel, which was carrying military stores and general cargo, was wrecked at Ringvad Point, near Gunnrsquos Island, while en route from Liverpool for Takoradi.Anyone who can assist William with information about the Georgetown Victory is asked to contact him on    or pop into his shop in Quay Street..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call to be vigilant of seals  ","story":"VISITORS to Minerstown beach are being urged to tread carefully to protect seals and the arearsquos rich ecology.The appeal has been issued by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with officials particularly keen for boats and jet skis to stay away from key areas.Minerstown beach mdash popular with locals and visitors alike ndash is located within the Strangford and Lecale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and, along with neighbouring Tyrella, is part of the Murlough Special Area of Conservation and area of special scientic interest.Noted for its honeycomb worm reefs and harbour seals, Minerstown was particularly busy over recent months with many people furloughed from work as part of sweeping coronavirus lockdown measures visiting the beach where harbour seals which are protected by law.Then animals use the rocky outcrops just offshore as so-called haul-out and pupping sites with the peak pupping season running from the end of June to mid-July.Pups wean from their mothers approximately four weeks after birth and, for this reason, council officials are asking all watercraft owners to stay away from the haul-out areas until the end of October.Council staff say that with seals very sensitive to disturbance, it is important for people to leave them alone.They say the area between the beachrsquos high and low tide marks is an important site for sand flats with boulders containing the honeycomb worm reef, a Northern Ireland priority marine feature.The worm lives in tubes constructed from small pieces of sand and shell fragment cemented together forming reefs between pebbles and boulders in the middle shore.Council officials have explained that these delicate reefs are under threat from beachgoers walking in the area and from vehicles driving on the beach.ldquoUnderstanding the impact that our actions can have and following simple advice will protect the health of the wildle at Minerstown beach and protect it for future generations, said officials.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said people were spoilt for choice when it came to local beaches and the waterways, with Minerstown one area which has seen an increase in use during the lockdown period.ldquoUnfortunately, an increase in the use of the beach and its surrounding waters can cause some problems for the local wildle, he said.ldquoThe council is asking beach goers to help it protect these beauty spots and the associated plants and animals by being mindful of how their actions can impact on the environment.Describing Minerstown as a ldquovery special place, she said it was important for local wildle.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoWhile we want our residents and visitors to enjoy the wonderful coast that our district has to offer, we also want to protect the habitats and species that make this place so special.ldquoPlease help us to protect this area by not taking vehicles onto the beach, stay away from the seal haul-out sites, always keep dogs under control and not allow them to chase birds.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council.

He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation.

Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

The specic timings for reopening may y from place to place as owners take assessments and make any necessary changes.ldquoAs we take these cautious steps, no one should make the mistake of thinking the virus has gone away. We could find our hard work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in every way we can, to keep Wales safe.The Welsh Government has previously asked a number of businesses to begin preparing to reopen from July ,the conditions allow.These are as follows:bull Close contact services, including nail and beauty salons and businesses providing tanning services, massages, body piercings, tattooing, electrolysis or acupuncture.bull Indoor cinemas, museums, galleries and archive services.bull Tourist accommodation with shared facilities, such as camping sites. Opening would be from July .bull Reopening the housing market fully.Provided the reopening of these sectors goes well and conditions allow, indoor opening for pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants will resume from August , following the outcome of the next review of the coronavirus regulations. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Commenting proprietor Brian Jardine said: “It’s been a pleasure to welcome our customers back to the Pot Belly and to hear their positive feedback on our distancing and sanitising measures.“Part of our measures to keep everyone safe includes our two Gel-Gem sanitising units which are front of house and at the entry to our separate upstairs restaurant and a new external covered space, our Terraced Bar.”Gel-Gem came about at the beginning of lockdown when most businesses were closed said Raymond Fegan of construction and property maintenance company d Property Services. “The amount of enquiries we received from business of all sizes led us to develop a solution to help the fight against Covid-. “One of the early issues we identied and worked to overcome was the fragile nature of some sanitising systems being installed into entrances which took up considerable space and required regular monitoring and replacement. “We wanted to design a hands-free unit which was locally produced, high capacity and which was built to last.Studying the market we believe that in offering a sturdy, solid and safe stainless steel construction which includes a gel level monitoring window, we’ve done just that.“Gel-Gem comes in three dferent sanitising gel capacities - ,  and a mammoth  litre version for higher footfall areas.They can be used outside and we are also producing bespoke ‘all ability’ models and models which include provision to store contact tracing details, order to meet the specic needs of our clients. “Working to provide solutions for our clients across the local area, from small shops to the Bouled Outlet and from churches to sports clubs we have been delighted with the feedback we have been receiving not only for our Gel-Gem’s but also for our new hand-friendly sanitising gel which we can supply wholesale. “We are also delighted that every sale of a Gel-Gem unit supports the work of charity Kidney Care UK as they support local kidney patients which highlights the need to sanitise not only for ourselves but for those who are clinically vulnerable and at higher risk of infection.”Concluding Brian Jardine said: “At The Pot Belly we are very proud of our historic roots and excited about once again welcoming our customers back to enjoy our locally sourced menu’s while at the same time taking the steps to keep everyone safe.”If you want to find out more about the Gel-Gem units visit www.d-ps gel-gem or contact Raymond at gel-gem@d-ps\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are  most desirable dogs breeds do you have one them ","story":"These are the  most desirable dogs breeds -
