The house was large, with seven bedrooms and a cellar, and had belonged to the Balakjians for 27 years. The scale of the task overwhelmed him both parents were artists and printmakers, with busy studios full of objects he had never been allowed to touch. His mother’s death from cancer four years earlier had already triggered a career change: in the year that followed, Aram wound down his web design business to develop his passion for writing and photography, and now, as he started clearing it, he began to take pictures of the house.“I thought, ‘I’ll never really see this again,’” he says. “I wanted to capture how the house was. I wanted to get those things in my head.” He knew that the process of dismantling nearly three decades of family life would be laborious and painful. He was six when the family moved into the house in north London, and the photographs were a way of securing the memories for him, his sister Tamar and any future children.But it was hard to know where to start. The house was awash with loss. His father, Marc Balakjian, had died in the living room, the same room in which his mother, Dorothea Wight, had passed away four years earlier. Together, his parents had built up the business of Studio Prints, printers to Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach and Paula Rego among others, and it took Balakjian a week, “intermittently breaking down”, just to sort through the papers in the room they called “the computer room”. He thought, “How can we ever let go of this house? How can this ever not be our house?”Daily he was floored by “emotional grenades”: a diary his father kept after his mother died, his grief-stricken poems, the sheer volume of stuff, or as Balakjian puts it, “all these things that meant so much to someone who meant so much to you”. Each one required an emotional valuation. “You’re dismantling their lives. It’s the end of their story. You really have this sense of what’s left after we die. Just a bunch of things, really.” And, of course, hundreds of family snapshots.When Balakjian had finished, he reached for his camera again, this time to photograph the empty rooms. “It wasn’t the house I was struggling to let go of. It was the memory of our parents, that whole life, growing up, our youthful innocence.”He had the idea of juxtaposing or conflating these empty images with the ones he had taken of the house immediately after his father’s death when it was still full of his parents’ things, “to show this weird contrast of what I experienced as I was clearing the house... this slow hacking away of emotions, and separation of them from the physical space”. He held up a printed photograph of a room full of family paraphernalia, and reshot it in exactly the same place, now empty. The image, showing both the before and after in a single frame, excited him. He tried the same with one of the hundreds of family snapshots he had unearthed. “That’s interesting,” he thought. “I can make the two images line up. It feels like looking through a window of the past.”Here was the warmth of a family moment – each one raising the spectre of a lifetime of similar moments – suspended within a bright, empty room. Sometimes the inset pictures overlap with their host image others butt up against them starkly. Still others show family moments appearing to hover in thin air. It is hard to tell which image feels more ghostly, the occupied or the unoccupied room. They haunt each other.Making the two photographs line up seamlessly, as Balakjian first intended, proved impossible. As a result, the viewer sees both the continuities and discontinuities between the spaces the two cameras captured, the parquet kinks and the wood panelling warps where the past and present meet.Bookshelves burst with books then terminate in emptiness. Flames flicker in one half of a fireplace while the neighbouring coals lie cold. The leaves of a copper beech glow burgundy, then abruptly wither. Random and bizarre episodes from years of family life are held to the light: a child (Balakjian himself) larks around the kitchen holding an orange, with a silly hairdo his father carries a packet of flour teenage girls, one of them Balakjian’s sister, rock face masks in a stupendously carpeted bathroom. All families know their lived space by heart, but every image here ends with the same heart-wrenching dispossession.Yet for Balakjian, the process felt constructive. “The only way I could do the project was to detach myself from what I was looking at,” he says. “Most of the time, I didn’t look at the snapshot I was holding. I wouldn’t allow myself to ‘go there’ and to be in that room. I was thinking from a very technical point of view.”Over two months, he took nearly 3,000 photos. Each time, he had to place himself in the footprints of the person who had taken the original image – usually his father. Marc, the son of Armenian genocide survivors, was “not emotionally open at all”, says his son. Presumably, trying to see long-forgotten family moments from his perspective must have created its own challenges.“By the end, it wasn’t emotional,” Balakjian says. The process of clearing, sharpened by the practise of photography, led to a sort of disinvestment. “I was actually really happy to hand the house over to a new family,” he says. “I felt we’d borrowed this space for 30 years. We built these amazing things, and now it was time for someone else to come in.”• Go to arambalakjianworkthe-house to see more images from Aram’s projectIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be16d5eb521cc536a80a6e88dde9cd5d914ac764/0_59_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41b004580b25b351a453579004ffaf79","title":"vintage posters sporting heroes and summer fun swann auction galleries","story":"Some of the world’s finest artists turned their hand to sports posters in the 20th century.

On Friday, Goals said the new accounting scandal meant it would be unable to file its financial results by the end of September. Failure to meet the deadline means trading in the shares cannot resume and the company will be delisted.“The directors do not now believe this timeframe for the audit is achievable and no longer expect the ordinary shares in the company to resume trading,” Goals said in a statement.The news will infuriate Ashley, who has been at loggerheads with the company’s board for months over the accounting errors, as his multimillion-pound stake in the business remains in limbo. Goals had a market value of £20.5m when trading of its shares was suspended in March.Sports Direct, which first invested in Goals in 2015, is facing financial difficulties of its own with the Belgian authorities slapping a €674m (£605m) tax bill on the business.This has given the company’s lenders the confidence to confirm they will continue to back the business, keeping existing debt facilities in place to allow it to trade. Goals had net debt of £29m at the end of 2018.In June, Goals appointed Deloitte to look at the prospect of selling the business. The company is also struggling with the turnover of senior management. In May, its chief executive, Andy Anson, was appointed head of the British Olympic Association after just over a year in the job.

And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

They can also register a birth, marriage or orce. But they still cannot marry, or leave prison or a domestic violence shelter without the consent of their male s – often a father, brother, or other male relative.The bizarre ship system is pervasive in Saudi Arabia. It stipulates that women are not legal persons, and consequently, they have to be represented by male relatives to work, marry, study, travel, and seek medical care.The Saudi regime has relied on a narrow interpretation of walayah (ship) in Islamic theology to enforce a quarantine over women for the last half century. It gave men power over women, while depriving them of their political, civil and human rights.Throughout Islamic history, no other government has enforced such a pervasive ship system. In Saudi Arabia and in most Muslim countries, women cannot marry without the consent of their . But in one Islamic school of jurisprudence, the Hanafi, adult women can marry without a  present.Yet in Saudi Arabia, the official Hanbali school of the state’s legal system, and its Wahhabi religious scholars, preachers and judges, stipulate that  is the only one who can approve a daughter’s marriage. Women can take a father who obstructs marriage to court, and if successful, the judge will become her  to give consent. In all cases, a woman needs the consent of a man to marry – and the recent announcement keeps this requirement in place.Many Saudi women who pushed the agenda to be treated as equal citizens won’t be able to celebrate the recent announcement as many are either in prison – such as Lujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi and Nasima al-Sada – or banned from travel, like Aziza al-Yousef, Hatoon al-Fassi, and Eman al-Nafjan. Others have fled the country and sought asylum in Canada, Australia, the US and Europe, among them Hala al-Dosari, Saffaa Hassanein and Omaima al-Najjar.This combination of reform and repression under the leadership of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman – whose initiatives include increasing the employment of women and appointing them to high-profile jobs in government – baffles not only Saudi feminists, but also outside observers.The Saudi feminist movement has proved to be the most organised and articulate civil society in the country. It operates on multiple levels. On the ground, teachers, doctors, charity workers and civil servants silently help battered women and report abuse. At another level, there are those vocal women who have taken the struggle to be free and equal beyond Saudi Arabia, securing the support of the global feminist movement. This annoys the regime as it punctures the persistent narrative that it is the only source of protection and empowerment. Moreover, women have popularised the language of rights for all. The regime’s nightmare is for this language to spread beyond its control, which is why so many vocal and courageous women have been silenced behind bars. Saudi Arabia’s reputation is reaching an unprecedented low ebb, following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last year, and the publicity around the Saudi runaway girls who end up stranded at international airports while waiting for a charitable country to grant them asylum. These women have often run away as a result of abuse or forced marriage.Granting women the right to travel abroad, therefore, is timely and has a feelgood factor, especially among potential foreign investors. Unemployed, educated women may start seeking jobs abroad, in nearby Gulf countries or beyond. Now there are Saudi women working as lecturers at British universities, researchers in the US, journalists such as Iman al-Hamoud in France, graphic designers and artists in Dubai, and many other highly educated women who work in finance, art and the media.The Saudi economy itself is still incapable of absorbing the number of female graduates. Many among them are PhD students who return home after several years studying abroad to find no appropriate jobs in their fields.There will be further relaxation of rules governing women’s lives, but several hurdles restricting both men and women remain. As the Saudi centralised economy seeks liberalisation and privatisation, many men and women may not find jobs in their desired sector – and the right of women to leave the country legally will contribute to a brain-drain, leaving the field open for a reversal of the decision to let them go without the consent of a .Saudi Arabia needs urgent political reforms to ensure that rights given now under duress are never reversed or abandoned. These rights should be enshrined in a political culture of equal citizenship to all.• Madawi al-Rasheed is a visiting professor at the LSE Middle East Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/173f813b509d75716bcdeef500dd7161eca71907/0_67_2942_1765/master/2942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d46b0febf274f0b974e1f02b3cf3d2a","title":"the guardian view on non stop sports just not cricket","story":"The football and cricket seasons have expanded beyond all reason. Spectators and players need a breakTo every thing there is a season a time to bowl, a time to bat, a time to sweep, a time to block, a time to dribble, a time to pass, a time to shoot, a time to knock it over to the big lad in the middle and hope for the best. Or at least that used to be the case, until the cricket and football seasons blended into one and we reached the current sorry situation where the first Ashes Test and the football season started in the same week. Denis Compton, who in an age when the seasons were happily compartmentalised played 78 Tests for England and won the FA Cup with Arsenal, must be spinning in his grave.The opening salvo in the Ashes battle was fired at Edgbaston on Thursday. More bathetically, the English football season begins on Friday with a championship match between Luton and Middlesbrough. No disrespect to Eric Morecambe’s beloved club, but this is a joke: who wants to spend a balmy evening in early August at Kenilworth Road? There is a full programme of Football League fixtures on Saturday, and Sunday sees the first showpiece match of the season when Manchester City and Liverpool play for the Community Shield. Why? Who decrees that the football season has to start so ridiculously early, just two months after the end of the previous one? Would football fans really mind if it started in early September as the schools went back and temperatures started to drop? And wouldn’t the players benefit from a shorter season, rather than the current bloated, virtually year-round one?The end of August used to mark the change of the sporting seasons, with cricket giving way to football and an overlap of at most a couple of weeks. Now, the overlap is almost two months, with first-class cricket – thanks to a combination of global heating and the proliferation of identikit midsummer Twenty20 matches – carrying on until 26 September. The final Test at the Oval, which always used to be played at August bank holiday, is not scheduled to end until 16 September – five Ashes Tests crammed into less than seven weeks at the tailend of the summer. The main reason for this odd scheduling is that the Cricket World Cup took up most of June and July, but surely that long-drawn-out event could have been a little shorter. The first, unforgettable tournament in 1975 was done and dusted in a fortnight.This trend towards gargantuanism, fuelled by television’s pursuit of product and sports administrators’ desire for dosh, must be resisted as much as possible. Ease the sporting bombardment and let spectators and players enjoy both sports, ideally in their traditional seasons. Who knows, perhaps then we will see a successor to CB Fry, who at the turn of the 20th century played both cricket and football for England and still had time to equal the world long jump record. He could also leap from a standing start on to a mantelpiece, which is not a feat that Joe Root or Harry Kane would have time to perfect in this over-specialised, over-stuffed sporting age of ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58791dcd7a99183d1f6e93e59718b581f1ea2417/0_268_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=563f7804d3eb0d8bc13830e9a43e8422","title":"victorias secret female friendly shtick pleasing men lingerie","story":"Lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret seems to be having an identity crisis. For the first time since its launch in 1995, its runway show has been cancelled, with model Shanina Shaik telling reporters that the company is trying to work on its branding. This comes in the wake of falling sales and controversy surrounding the show’s lack of ersity.Furthermore, the show’s whole shtick – a parade of almost naked models, each a perfect mix of skinny-curvy, decked in angel wings (an accessory the historians of the future will undoubtedly view with bafflement, if not complete derision) being ogled by men – looks dated after #MeToo. Donald Trump used to be a frequent guest at the shows Les Wexner, CEO of Victoria’s Secret’s parent brand, L Brands, owned Jeffrey Epstein’s New York mansion and was one of his former financial clients (the brand has distanced itself from Epstein).Of late, women’s magazines have jettisoned stories about the extreme nil-by-mouth dieting and exercise measures undertaken by the models in the run-up to the show, in favour of articles about body positivity. Lingerie brands aimed at young women, such as Aerie, ThirdLove and Lively, promote body ersity and oppose airbrushing. They seem miles away from the pornified aesthetic that girls – and I mean girls – were encouraged to adopt a couple of decades ago, in no small part due to Victoria’s Secret. This was lingerie touted as empowering, but it didn’t feel that way. That’s not to say that lingerie didn’t hold a sexual charge, but that charge felt mandated and tawdry.Victoria’s Secret was originally launched to appeal to men, to provide a place where they could buy saucy underwear for their wives and girlfriends without feeling uncomfortable. It was based on the idea of a Victorian boudoir – hence the name – and the original shops were kitted out that way, all drapery and chandeliers. Perhaps this is why the chain found itself in trouble and was scooped up in 1982 by Wexler who supposedly made it more female-focused.Supposedly? Because, for me, being good at flogging products to women and acting in their interests is not the same thing “female focused” doesn’t mean “female friendly”. When I co-wrote a feminist book, The Vagenda, there was a whole chapter on the way lingerie is marketed. But whether you’re critiquing lingerie or fad diets or magazines, the counter-argument was always the same: “but women are buying it” – a view that failed to take into account socialisation (as though we emerge from the womb primed to be buyers of crotchless thongs), consumer choice, media imagery and the complex nature of sexuality and desire, not least how it interplays with female objectification.John Berger nailed the tension in Ways of Seeing, a decade before Wexner bought Victoria’s Secret, when he wrote of the male gaze: “A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. While she is walking across a room or while she is weeping at the death of her father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. And so she comes to consider the surveyor and the surveyed within her as the two constituent yet always distinct elements of her identity as a woman. She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to men is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another.” It’s a fortunate woman who hasn’t felt this to some extent at some point in her life.As with any aspect of feminist critique, lingerie will induce mixed feelings in women depending on their body shape, cultural background, politics, income, sexuality, etc. There are no absolutes, as the beautiful artwork Every Curve, by Zoe Buckman, demonstrates. Buckman hand-sewed Tupac and Notorious BIG lyrics about women on to gorgeous pieces of antique lingerie, in order to explore “the contradictory and complementary influences of feminism and hip-hop in her upbringing”. Tracey Emin’s use of blood-stained lingerie in My Bed, meanwhile, drew attention to feminine corporeality.Women may have been buying Victoria’s Secret lingerie in their millions. Some women did undoubtedly feel empowered by it (just as others will feel empowered by simple cotton pants from M\u0026ampS). Nevertheless, we all know the joke about the Victoria’s Secret catalogue, and its status as a male masturbation bible. Even those of us who didn’t grow up in the US knew that Victoria’s Secret was about pleasing men. The trick it so successfully pulled off was convincing many of us that pleasing men meant also always pleasing ourselves, but now women are voting with their feet. And I don’t blame them. There’s something cheap, tawdry and passé about the whole brand identity. It conjures Hugh Hefner, satin sheets, scenes from the novels of John Updike.There is so much toss written about lingerie, about how it’s a way of “unleashing your inner goddess”, so it’s refreshing that comfort and inclusivity are now on the agenda. I’m curious to see how Victoria’s Secret will strive to reinvent itself in a post-#MeToo era. But some readers will no doubt say I’m overthinking it. After all, as Dorothy Parker said, “Brevity is the soul of lingerie.”• Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a  columnist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d27db2ed4dbdc2ca8591745ea053df89e9fce7b/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e881a855aa340d25a1e6f3d32072cb60","title":"only in canada weird and wonderful experiences countrywide","story":"Want to track down the mythical Ogopogo, ice-skate on the Atlantic Ocean or get your hands on a polar bear-shaped number plate?

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours. Our favourite to date has to be the brownie cheesecake! But if you’re not in Ontario, check out Lucky’s Doughnuts at the 49th Parallel Café in BC or family-owned business, Bronuts in Winnipeg.

Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery to learn a bit more about western Canada’s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour.

Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currencyIn the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.Fly WestJet to discover (and enjoy!) the weird and the wonderful things in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bb022811f6c1a5399a369373206922cec5fe7fb/0_110_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77993adb31b2d72fbefb940893caf774","title":"record heatwave made much more likely by human impact on climate","story":"Scientists say July at least equalled and may have beaten hottest month on recordThe record-breaking heatwave that roasted Europe last month was a one-in-a-thousand-year event made up to 100 times more likely by human-driven climate change, scientists have calculated.Around the globe, July at least equalled and may have surpassed the hottest month on record, according to data from the World Meteorological Organization. This followed the warmest June on record.Temperature records were broken in many countries, wildfires continue to devastate vast areas of Siberia, the Greenland ice sheet is melting at a near record rate, and the risk of drought has grown more acute across wide areas of central and eastern Europe.The extreme heat is particularly unusual because it is not an El Niño year – the phenomenon usually associated with prolonged temperature surges. Instead, scientists say it is driven to a large extent by carbon emissions from car exhausts, power plant chimneys, burning forests and other human sources.How much these factors loaded the dice in the two- to three-day heatwave during the last week of July was the subject of an attribution study by a consortium of meteorologists and climatologists at the UK Met Office, Oxford University and other prominent European institutions.It found that the extreme heat in France and the Netherlands, where temperatures peaked above 40C, was made at least 10 times and possibly more than 100 times more likely by climate change. In the UK, which set a record of 38.7C on 25 July, the human impact on the climate made the high temperatures at least two to three times more probable.There was considerable variation from place to place, but in all the studied locations the scientists said it would have been 1.5C to 3C cooler without climate change.Although the recent heat has been described as historic, it is unlikely to remain that way for long, according to the authors of the study. “It will not make history. These records will be broken in few years,” said Friederike Otto, of the University of Oxford. “What we see with European heatwaves is that all the climate models are underestimating the change that we see.” She said further study would investigate how likely it was to have two intense heatwaves in the space of two months.The paper says the extreme heat will have an impact on human wellbeing, though the data on this often lags, which can mean it fails to draw much public attention.“Heatwaves during the height of summer pose a substantial risk to human health and are potentially lethal,” the paper says. “The full impact is known only after a few weeks when the mortality figures have been analysed. Effective heat emergency plans, together with accurate weather forecasts such as those issued before this heatwave, reduce impacts and are becoming even more important in light of the rising risks.”The UN secretary general, António Guterres, who has called a special climate summit of world leaders in September, said the seasons were moving alarmingly far from their usual path. “We have always lived through hot summers, but this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather’s summer,” he said. “Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives, and for our lives. It is a race that we can and must win.”The World Meteorological Organization expects 2015-19 to be the warmest five-year period ever recorded. “July has rewritten climate history, with dozens of new temperature records at local, national and global level,” said the organisation’s secretary general, Petteri Taalas. “Unprecedented wildfires raged in the Arctic for the second consecutive month, devastating once pristine forests which used to absorb carbon dioxide and instead turning them into fiery sources of greenhouse gases. This is not science fiction. It is the reality of climate change. It is happening now and it will worsen in the future without urgent climate action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aee90ae8c341e16b8a2a26a7fb314d6785e4cb1d/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b5f170b2a7bcae438cceda759338628 880w","title":"what to wear august five looks five days in pictures","story":"From spaghetti straps to hiking sandals, these outfits will help you keep cool while the warm weather continues – but can be restyled long into next season"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/575c8b75f3c759ec62ee3791f50fd55c0e5d62c2/0_122_3876_2326/master/3876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95a2306443444091304950764cf5a1f5","title":"jurgen klopp evolution revolution liverpool community shield","story":"Klopp says his side were a ‘results machine’ last season and keeping hold of star players is as valuable as new signingsJürgen Klopp did not spell it out in quite these terms but over the past four seasons Manchester City’s Premier League finishes have been fourth, third, first and first. This coincides with his tenure at Liverpool. Since he arrived in October 2015, Liverpool have finished eighth, fourth, fourth and second. It is why Klopp said of City: “They are clear favourites. How could we be favourites?”City’s points tally over those four seasons reads: 66, 78, 100, 98.

Essentially, Klopp feels his Reds are a year behind the Blues.As Klopp prepared for Sunday’s Community Shield match with City, there was a hint of incredulity about his response when asked about City’s favourites’ status for the title.“Because they’ve won the league twice in a row?” he replied by way of an isn’t-that-obvious explanation. “That’s one reason. Ours was the first year on that level we have to prove again that we can be on that level. Ninety-seven points was not a coincidence but it’s not as if we outplayed all the teams, that we shot them out of the stadium constantly. We had tight games. We were a real results machine last year, really impressive.”The same description could be applied to City, who seized the title with 14 straight victories from February to May and, as Klopp said, City have not got weaker.Klopp omitted the sales of Fabian Delph and Douglas Luiz, but City have signed Rodri and Angelino. Liverpool, as some of the more anxious fans note, have not made a perceived major signing.This, however, is not the negative to Klopp that it is to some. He has retained his core squad and is relaxed, perhaps, because his Bundesliga-winning Borussia Dortmund teams were raided for players such as Mario Götze, Nuri Sahin and Robert Lewandowski before fully maturing together. “For the first time in my career, from next Monday I will have the team back together again, that’s true,” he said.“These are the transfers we did,” referring to new contracts secured over the past year for Sadio Mané, Mo Salah and others. It is 18 months since Virgil van Dijk joined, 12 since Alisson arrived, plus Naby Keïta, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri.“Keeping the boys together, staying aggressive, greedy: let’s get going again,” he said.It is evolution after a revolution, although losing once in reaching 97 points suggests scope for improvement is limited compared with, for example, Liverpool’s previous summer. Klopp acknowledged this: “The higher you get, the more difficult it is. But we have a lot of space for improvement. First, we have to try to reach last season’s level again.“When, if that happens, then you can make the next steps but it’s not always … it’s not PlayStation where you can go to the next skill or whatever.”What he has stressed as much as anything is the Champions League win over Tottenham is not dwelt on. That, he knows, is easier said than done.Reflecting on continuing jubilation, Klopp said wryly: “If you’re not successful, people still want pictures, but don’t talk to you that long.“If you win something, everybody feels the need to tell you – first of all ‘congratulations’, then where they watched it, how they watched it, how they felt, how their family felt, how their friends felt, how the dog felt.“It’s all nice but it keeps you in that moment. I want to be completely focused on a new season.”Mané, Klopp noted, will have had 16 days off this summer. Fifpro, the international players’ union, released a report this week on the subject: ‘At the Limit.’ Mané, they said, played 70 games for club and country over the past 12 months. Spurs’ Son Heung-min played 78.There will be a winter break in the Premier League this season, although the league described it as “a mid-season player break” when it was announced, as games will continue in a staggered form over two weekends in February.It feels a long way away to Klopp. “The Premier League is such a wonderful product. We don’t need these two weeks now where nobody in the whole world is playing, only the Premier League. It doesn’t make sense.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974ef47a5a96b017510dca7371c48fd133d416c1/2_125_3522_2113/master/3522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09b9644f045a0937b47fa119d25fea4a","title":"manchester united harry maguire deal buy leicester 80m","story":"• Maguire in line to become world’s most expensive defender• United also open to moves for Dybala and MandzukicManchester United believe they need Harry Maguire so badly that they have agreed to pay Leicester City £80m for the centre-back, who will become the world’s most expensive defender if he passes a medical.The fee eclipses the £75m that Liverpool forked out to Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in 2018 and United hope Maguire will make an impact similar to the one the Dutchman has had at Anfield. Manchester City were also keen on hiring Maguire but recoiled at the price.Leicester, who rejected lower bids from United earlier in the summer, refused to budge, leaving United with no choice but to hand over an unprecedented sum or shop elsewhere. The club saw no other suitable option, especially after a previous target, Matthijs de Ligt, left Ajax for Juventus.If the agreement represents a negotiating victory for Leicester, it also leaves Brendan Rodgers with a big gap to fill in his squad before the season kicks off. He is likely to make a move for Brighton’s Lewis Dunk.Ole Gunnar Solskjær, meanwhile, will be satisfied that his defence has been substantially reinforced, with Maguire’s probable arrival following the capture of the right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who joined from Crystal Palace for £45m.United hope their signings will not stop with Maguire. They remain keen on Paulo Dybala and have asked Juventus about the availability of another of their attacking players, Mario Mandzukic. Juventus say they will contemplate selling the Croatia striker only if a swap involving Dybala and Romelu Lukaku goes through. Both clubs want the swap to happen, and Lukaku is also happy with the arrangement, but they are waiting for Dybala to decide.United have work to do in that regard. Dybala will not consider joining unless he is among the club’s top earners and is demanding higher wages than have been offered. His image rights, which are owned by an agency, and the money sought by his agents could also be stumbling blocks.United have made their defensive revamp a priority, however. They conceded more goals than any other team in the top half of the Premier League except for West Ham – and the toll would have been heavier still but for David de Gea, even if the goalkeeper had a substandard season.Maguire, too, was a little below his best last season. He went into that campaign on the back of an excellent World Cup with England and a splendid first season at Leicester, whom he joined from Hull City for what has proved a bargain £12m fee (rising to £17m).Although he was often superb last season, he also had uncharacteristic lapses and his sloppiness spilled over into his performances for England in the Nations League in June. That highlighted a truth that Maguire and United must address: although the 26-year-old is set to change clubs for a world-record fee, he is not yet a world-class player.But he does have outstanding qualities and a proven ability to rise to fresh challenges, having played his way up from the lower leagues to become an England regular. Most of his appearances for his hometown club Sheffield United came in League One.His attitude is exemplary and nothing about his character suggests he will create strife in a United squad whose mentality has been questioned in recent seasons. Solskjær has been at pains to ensure new arrivals bring positivity, not preciousness.Maguire’s aerial power will also be a welcome addition to United’s backline. It was one of the factors in Leicester conceding fewer goals from set pieces last season than any other team in the Premier League. He is also strong in the tackle and a smart reader of play. Although his primary duty at United will be to secure their defence, most likely alongside Victor Lindelöf, especially now that Eric Bailly faces four to five months out with a knee injury sustained during pre-season, he is also much better equipped than the club’s other centre-backs to launch attacks.He can play out well from the back, blessed with a decent range of passing, neat feet and a fondness for barnstorming runs forward. He will need to judge such surges well, however, because he does not have the speed to recover after giving ground to top forwards.Maguire is a very good player who could become invaluable to United with the right guidance. It is up to Solskjær to show the coaching skills needed to help him perform consistently to the level required, which, presumably, at least means qualifying this season for the Champions League, in which Maguire has never played."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa85f390b096d2541fd7f877f336e58178f4ca9/0_0_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=007a242d66c76a96ba72a55ed9846dbe","title":"lets move to bermondsey south east london tom dyckhoff","story":"Eighty years of change have left a cityscape that looks as if it has been put together by a vigorous game of consequencesWhat’s going for it?

Originally a hit for all-female outfit Labelle in 1974, it was covered by All Saints in 1998. But the definitive recording (sorry Labelle) was the Missy Elliott-produced version for the Moulin Rouge soundtrack in 2001. Who among us didn’t alert our parents to the fact we were failing GCSE French by chanting: “Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?” thinking it was “something to do with dancing?” Back then it was a groundbreaking idea to have four pop superstars – Pink, Mýa, Lil’ Kim, Christina Aguilera – on the same track, singing about sex and wearing lingerie in the video.But in 2019, DJ Khaled doesn’t get out of bed unless he’s got at least 23 artists recording his voicemail message, and pop lyrics are a bit more graphic than coyly referencing a sleepover in a foreign language (see: Megan Thee Stallion breaking down every sexual experience she’s ever had in graphic detail). But still, not content with appearing on every song and TV show ever, Ed Sheeran recently revealed that he wanted to do an all-male version of Lady Marmalade. It would be incredible to get an updated version – a fantasy lineup would be, say, Beyoncé, Carly Rae Jepsen, Cardi B and Rihanna – or a weird one – Post Malone, Charli XCX, Clown from Slipknot, Mutya from Sugababes. But PLEASE spare us the bargain-bin British one (inevitably: Rita Ora, Dua Lipa, Jess Glynne and Jessie J really labouring Christina Aguilera’s part), or the quirky indie one – you just know it’d be Charlie from Busted, a Pigeon Detective, him off the Kaiser Chiefs and Lewis Capaldi gurning in a corset. Basically, the lineup we should hold out for is the original. The evidence: last year, Mýa – the one out of the four with the most time on her hands – called for a reunion, and Pink recently confirmed that she and Christina “hugged it out” on the set of The Voice US, ending their longstanding feud. In October last year, Aguilera bought Lil’ Kim out at a gig to perform part of the song. Bizarrely, this summer, Lil’ Kim and Mýa are heading off on a yacht for a reality show called Girls Cruise (yep: just them on a boat with Chilli from TLC, because why not?).

But his bravado has been masking something elseSydney’s Brent Griffin has been making music as Spod since 1995 but, he says, “I’ve never thought about this stuff out loud before.”More than a stage name, Spod is a loosely worn character: a wild party-starter, a joke, an absolute in charisma and confidence with a loyal cult audience. Mostly, he’s been renowned for the chaotic, high-octane electroclash party sets he’s played for more than two decades shows packed with confetti, streamers, glitter, backup dancers and red roses handed out to the audience mid-set. With fans including Henry Rollins, Ariel Pink and Jeremy Neale, his is the ultimate stage presence, which evangelised partying years before Andrew WK made the concept his oeuvre.But his fourth album, Adult Fantasy, is something else: a nostalgic new-wave record that he began work on eight years ago. Released last week, it comes with an accompanying “TV special” that revels in its lo-fi aesthetic, filmed live to tape by Alex Smith (who has worked with Manic Street Preachers, Tori Amos, Peaches and Kylie Minogue) and a 46-minute closing track, which aims to set a world record for the most number of soloists (35, including Rollins, Ariel Pink and Jason Lytle from Grandaddy).Spod has always been big on concepts. Before this album was 2014’s Taste The Sadness: a song-by-song tonal flipside of his 2003 debut Taste The Radness, where his party boy character (“this big suburban dude thinking he’s a sex symbol”) is transposed into an unsuccessful later life, lonely and hated by his kids. The song Letz Dance becomes Last Dance Totally Rad becomes Totally Sad and F**k Yeah!! becomes Hell No.Griffin’s is a particular creativity, delivered with an envious degree of confidence. So it’s startling for him to reveal, after almost 25 years of making party, that there’s an immense discomfort driving it all that he has never publicly discussed.“I need to feel out of my depth. I need to reverse-engineer things, whether that’s my own anxiety or fear,” he says.In early interviews, Griffin’s responses were given in-character, using an affected dialect that takes Snoop Dogg through Greater Western Sydney. (From 2003, on what to expect at a Spod gig: “Luv, power, flowerz, glitter, bubblez, freedom, dancing, hotness, radness and beatz that’ll snizap yo nizeck!”)“I think I combat that by just going extra hard. That anxiety — it’s always just bashing against a wall of anxiety, and getting through the other side.”Adult Fantasy, he says, is partly about “the delusion of still doing Spod, as old as I am, for as long as I have.” Griffin is 44 with a two-year-old daughter, but “it’s the same unit,” he says. “I wanted to show that it’s the same guy, transposed to a different time, and how he’s dealing with it.More than a mask to conceal his anxieties, the character of Spod has long been a key to Griffin’s creative practice. But his new record, he says, is the most Brent Griffin Spod album he’s done. He set no creative limitations as he wrote it, meaning, “it could be completely honest, embarrassing, whatever”, and has “a lot of lyrics that aren’t funny”.Make Things Right, for instance, is the song of a father warning his son about going out into the real world – but in fact it’s more personal.One of the record’s loveliest moments is its closing track, Golden Gaytime: a dreamy musing about an old man visiting his wife’s grave and having a nice ice cream as a treat. Its latter 41 minutes is a series of tribute solos performed by musicians including Ariel Pink, DZ Deathrays and Henry Rollins, and comedians like John Early, Claudia O’Doherty, and Doug Lussenhop. Asking people to be involved forced Griffin to confront another fear: collaboration.He even struggled asking his close friends to be on the track, worried they’d do it only out of obligation. In fact, he says, he finished the record a year ago – but crippling anxiety made him delay collecting the solos. “I’ll avoid contact with anyone, forever if I can. Which is terrible, because as soon as you open yourself up, it’s so much better.“Ugh,” he says, shuddering. “Just talking about it is making my lips quiver … you don’t want to let people know why you do stuff. That destroys everything, a lot of the time.“But if you try and control the narrative too much and be in character in an interview, it’s the fucking worst. At the beginning I would do that all the time, like make up a weird little language and stuff. It’s embarrassing to think back on. Can’t do that anymore. But I feel like I’m still being as ridiculous as ever.”• Adult Fantasy is out now through Rice is Nice.

By  Jia TolentinoThe ideal woman has always been generic. I bet you can picture the version of her that runs the show today. She’s of indeterminate age but resolutely youthful presentation. She’s got glossy hair and the clean, shameless expression of a person who believes she was made to be looked at. She is often luxuriating when you see her – on remote beaches, under stars in the desert, across a carefully styled table, surrounded by beautiful possessions or photogenic friends. Showcasing herself at leisure is either the bulk of her work or an essential part of it in this, she is not so unusual – for many people today, especially for women, packaging and broadcasting your image is a readily monetizable skill. She has a personal brand, and probably a boyfriend or husband: he is the physical realization of her constant, unseen audience, reaffirming her status as an interesting subject, a worthy object, a self-generating spectacle with a viewership attached.Can you see this woman yet? She looks like an Instagram – which is to say, an ordinary woman reproducing the lessons of the marketplace, which is how an ordinary woman evolves into an ideal. The process requires maximal obedience on the part of the woman in question, and – ideally – her genuine enthusiasm, too. This woman is sincerely interested in whatever the market demands of her (good looks, the impression of indefinitely extended youth, advanced skills in self-presentation and self-surveillance). She is equally interested in whatever the market offers her – in the tools that will allow her to look more appealing, to be even more endlessly presentable, to wring as much value out of her particular position as she can.The ideal woman, in other words, is always optimizing. She takes advantage of technology, both in the way she broadcasts her image and in the meticulous improvement of that image itself. Her hair looks expensive. She spends lots of money taking care of her skin, a process that has taken on the holy aspect of a spiritual ritual and the mundane regularity of setting a morning alarm.The work formerly carried out by makeup has been embedded directly into her face: her cheekbones or lips have been plumped up, or some lines have been filled in, and her eyelashes are lengthened every four weeks by a professional wielding inidual lashes and glue. The same is true of her body, which no longer requires the traditional enhancements of clothing or strategic underwear it has been pre-shaped by exercise that ensures there is little to conceal or rearrange.Everything about this woman has been pre-emptively controlled to the point that she can afford the impression of spontaneity and, more important, the sensation of it – having worked to rid her life of artificial obstacles, she often feels legitimately carefree. The ideal woman can be whatever she wants to be – as long as she manages to act upon the belief that perfecting herself and streamlining her relationship to the world can be a matter of both work and pleasure, or, in other words, of “lifestyle”. The ideal woman steps into a stratum of expensive juices, boutique exercise classes, skincare routines and vacations, and there she happily remains.Most women believe themselves to be independent thinkers. Even glossy women’s magazines now model skepticism toward top-down narratives about how we should look, who and when we should marry, how we should live. But the psychological parasite of the ideal woman has evolved to survive in an ecosystem that pretends to resist her. If women start to resist an aesthetic, like the overapplication of Photoshop, the aesthetic just changes to suit us the power of the ideal image never actually wanes. It is now easy enough to engage women’s skepticism toward ads and magazine covers, images produced by professionals. It is harder for us to suspect images produced by our peers, and nearly impossible to get us to suspect the images we produce of ourselves, for our own pleasure and benefit – even though, in a time when heavy social media use has become broadly framed as a career asset, many of us are effectively professionals now, too.Today’s ideal woman is of a type that coexists easily with feminism in its current market-friendly and mainstream form. This sort of feminism has organized itself around being as visible and appealing to as many people as possible it has greatly over-valorized women’s inidual success. Feminism has not eradicated the tyranny of the ideal woman but, rather, has entrenched it and made it trickier. These days, it is perhaps even more psychologically seamless than ever for an ordinary woman to spend her life walking toward the idealized mirage of her own self-image. She can believe – reasonably enough, and with the full encouragement of feminism – that she herself is the architect of the exquisite, constant and often pleasurable type of power that this image holds over her time, her money, her decisions, her selfhood and her soul.Figuring out how to “get better” at being a woman is a ridiculous and often amoral project – a subset of the larger, equally ridiculous, equally amoral project of learning to get better at life under accelerated capitalism. In these pursuits, most pleasures end up being traps, and every public-facing demand escalates in perpetuity. Satisfaction remains, under the terms of the system, necessarily out of reach.But the worse things get, the more a person is compelled to optimize. I think about this every time I do something that feels particularly efficient and self-interested, like going to a barre class or eating lunch at a fast-casual chopped-salad chain, like Sweetgreen, which feels less like a place to eat and more like a refueling station. I’m a repulsively fast eater in most situations – my boyfriend once told me that I chew like someone’s about to take my food away – and at Sweetgreen, I eat even faster because (as can be true of many things in life) slowing down for even a second can make the machinery give you the creeps. Sweetgreen is a marvel of optimization: a line of 40 people – a texting, shuffling, eyes-down snake – can be processed in 10 minutes, as customer after customer orders a kale caesar with chicken without even looking at the other, darker-skinned, hairnet-wearing line of people who are busy adding chicken to kale caesars as if it were their purpose in life to do so and their customers’ purpose in life to send emails for 16 hours a day with a brief break to snort down a bowl of nutrients that ward off the unhealthfulness of urban professional living.The ritualization and neatness of this process (and the fact that Sweetgreen is pretty good) obscure the intense, circular artifice that defines the type of life it’s meant to fit into. The ideal chopped-salad customer needs to eat his $12 salad in 10 minutes because he needs the extra time to keep functioning within the job that allows him to afford a regular $12 salad in the first place. He feels a physical need for this $12 salad, as it’s the most reliable and convenient way to build up a vitamin barrier against the general malfunction that comes with his salad-requiring-and-enabling job. As Matt Buchanan wrote at the Awl in 2015, the chopped salad is engineered to “free one’s hand and eyes from the task of consuming nutrients, so that precious attention can be directed toward a small screen, where it is more urgently needed, so it can consume data: work email or Amazon’s nearly infinite catalog or Facebook’s actually infinite News Feed, where, as one shops for diapers or engages with the native advertising sprinkled between the not-hoaxes and baby photos, one is being productive by generating revenue for a large internet company, which is obviously good for the economy, or at least it is certainly better than spending lunch reading a book from the library, because who is making money from that?”On today’s terms, what Buchanan is describing is the good life. It means progress, iniduation. It’s what you do when you’ve gotten ahead a little bit, when you want to get ahead some more. The hamster-wheel aspect has been self-evident for a long time now. But today, in an economy defined by precarity, more of what was merely stupid and adaptive has turned stupid and compulsory. Vulnerability, which is ever present, must be warded off at all costs. And so I go to Sweetgreen on days when I need to eat vegetables very quickly because I’ve been working till 1am all week and don’t have time to make dinner because I have to work till 1am again, and like a chump, I try to make eye contact across the sneeze guard, as if this alleviated anything about the skyrocketing productivity requirements that have forced these two lines of people to scarf and create kale caesars all day, and then I “grab” my salad and eat it in under 10 minutes while looking at email.It’s very easy, under conditions of artificial but continually escalating obligation, to find yourself organizing your life around practices you find ridiculous and possibly indefensible. Women have known this intimately for a long time.I was a late bloomer in terms of functional physical practices, like eating vegetables and exercising. I was a gymnast as a kid and then a cheerleader later, but one thing was fun and the second was effectively a requirement: at my school, you had to play a sport, and I lacked the hand-eye coordination to do anything else. As a teenager, I subsisted on pizza and queso and cinnamon rolls, trying to immunize myself with apathy and pleasure-seeking throughout the long stretch of time when girls, overwhelmed by sudden expectations of beauty, transmit anorexia and bulimia to one another like a virus. For the better part of a decade, I figured I was better off being slightly unhealthy and leaving the active pursuit of body-related matters alone.This all changed when I was 21 and volunteering in the Peace Corps. Under the circumstances, it was impossible to think too much about my appearance, and health was of such immediate importance it was always on my mind. I started doing yoga in my room every day as a prophylactic measure against mental breakdown. When I returned to America in 2011, I kept at it. Yoga helped me be gentle to myself during the process of readjustment, when I was constantly flooded with dread and spiritual uselessness, the sense that I had failed.And then, in 2012, at the end of a yoga class, I felt something shift. I was in grad school, deep in a period of daytime beers and open-ended self-discovery, and I was lying in final resting pose, suddenly wondering why motionlessness was supposed to be relaxing. The specter of stagnation hung heavy over my existence. I missed, suddenly, the part of me that thrilled to sharpness, harshness, discipline. I had been directing these instincts at my mind, hiding them from my body, but why? At that moment I needed something stronger than yoga, the unrestricted ease of which had reminded me, just then, that I didn’t know what I was doing, and likely never would.So, later that week, I printed out a Groupon trial offer at a studio called Pure Barre. I was greeted by an instructor who looked like Jessica Rabbit: ice-green eyes, a physically impossible hourglass figure, honey-colored hair rippling down past her waist. She ushered me into a cave-dark room full of sinewy women gathering mysterious red rubber props. The front wall was mirrored. The women stared at their reflections, stone-faced, preparing.Then class started, and it was an immediate state of emergency. Barre is a manic and ritualized activity, often set to deafening music and lighting changes. The rapid-fire series of positions and movements, dictated and enforced by the instructor, resembled what a ballerina might do if you concussed her and then made her snort caffeine pills – a fanatical, repetitive routine of arm gestures, leg lifts and pelvic tilts.By the end of class, my leg muscles had liquefied. Jessica turned the lights off and chirped that it was time for “back dancing”, a term that I thought, collapsing on to the floor, sounded like what people on a parenting message board might use as a euphemism for sex. It was, in fact, pretend-fucking: we lay on our backs and thrust our hips into the darkness with a sacrificial devotion that I had not applied to actual sex for years. The lights went on. Jessica cooed: “Great job, ladies.” Everybody clapped.Barre was invented in the 60s by Lotte Berk, a Jewish ballerina who developed an exercise method based on her dance training, and at 46, with her rigidly disciplined body as a walking billboard, founded a women-only exercise studio in a basement on London’s Manchester Street. It is now a national fixture across the US. The rise of barre is unparalleled in a few aspects: as far as exercise methods go, nothing this expensive and this uniform has gone this big. Hot yoga and pilates are both ubiquitous, but the pursuits have expanded at the level of inidual studios rather than nationwide chains. (Yoga classes also mostly hover around $20 or less, where barre, if you pay full price, often costs double that.) Among hundreds of thousands of women in dramatically different political and cultural environments, there seems to be an easy agreement that barre is worth it.In grad school in the midwest, I became a believer. I had been primed, first with my girlishly regimented physical training – dance, gymnastics, cheerleading – and then with yoga, my therapeutic on-ramp to the thing I was slowly realizing, which was that you could, without obvious negative consequences, control the way your body felt on the inside and worked on the outside by paying people to give you orders in a small, mirrored room. Barre was much too expensive for my grad school budget, but I kept paying for it. It seemed like an investment in a more functional life.Was it health I was investing in? In a very narrow way, it was. Barre has made me stronger and improved my posture. It has given me the luxury – off-limits to so many people, for so many stupid reasons – of not having to think about my body, because it mostly feels good, mostly works.But the endurance that barre builds is possibly more psychological than physical. What it’s really good at is getting you in shape for a hyper-accelerated capitalist life. It prepares you less for a half marathon than for a 12-hour workday, or a week alone with a kid and no childcare, or an evening commute on an underfunded train. Barre feels like exercise the way Sweetgreen feels like eating: both might better be categorized as mechanisms that help you adapt to arbitrary, prolonged agony. As a form of exercise, barre is ideal for an era in which everyone has to work constantly – you can be back at the office in five minutes, no shower necessary – and in which women are still expected to look unreasonably good.And of course it’s that last part, the looks thing, that makes barre feel so worthwhile to so many people. Barre is results-driven and appearance-based – it’s got the cultishness of CrossFit or a boot camp class, but with looks, not strength, as its primary goal. It’s only vaguely connected to ballet in terms of your actual movements, but conceptually, ballet is essential to the pitch. Among women, ballerinas have a uniquely legitimate reason to look taut and disciplined. There are plenty of other women who are thin and graceful-looking by professional requirement – models, escorts, actors – but ballerinas meet the beauty standard not just in the name of appearance or performance but also in the name of high athleticism and art. And so an exercise method even nominally drawn from ballet has the subtle effect of giving regular women a sense of serious, artistic, professional purpose in their pursuit of their ideal body. This is a good investment or, more precisely, a pragmatic self-delusion. Learning how to function more efficiently within an exhausting system: this seems to me to be the thing, with barre, that people pay $40 a class for, the investment that always brings back returns.The term “optimize” was used for the first time the way we currently use it, in economics, in the mid 19th century. “To satisfy our wants to the utmost with the least effort – to procure the greatest amount of what is desirable at the expense of the least that is undesirable – in other words, to maximize pleasure, is the problem of economics,” wrote William Stanley Jevons in The Theory of Political Economy. We all want to get the most out of what we have.Today, the principle of optimization – the process of making something, as the dictionary puts it, “as fully perfect, functional, or effective as possible” – thrives in extremity. An entire industry has even sprung up to give optimization a uniform: athleisure, the type of clothing you wear when you are either acting on or signaling your desire to have an optimized life. I define athleisure as exercise gear that you pay too much money for, but defined more broadly, athleisure was a $97bn category by 2016.Since its emergence around a decade ago, athleisure has gone through a few aesthetic iterations. At first, it was black leggings and colorful tank tops – a dex version of an early-aughts going-out uniform favored by women who might have, by the time of athleisure’s rise, shifted their daily social interactions to yoga and coffee dates. More recently, athleisure has branched off and reconverged in permutations. There is a sort of cosmic hippie look (elaborate prints, webbed galaxy patterns), a sort of monochrome LA look (mesh, neutrals, baseball hats), a minimalist and heathered Outdoor Voices aesthetic, and an influx of awful slogans like “I’ll See You at the Barre”. Brands include Lululemon (“Wunder Under High-Rise Tights”, described as “edgy”, cost $98), Athleta (“Pacifica Contoured Hoodie Tank”, a hooded tank top, is $59), Sweaty Betty (“Power Wetlook Mesh Crop Leggings”, which are “Bum Sculpting? You Bet Your Ass”, $120), the ghoulish brand Spiritual Gangster (leggings with “Namaste” across the ass, $88 cotton tank top screen-printed with “I’ll see it when I believe it”, $56).Men wear athleisure, but the idea, and the vast majority of the category, belongs to women. It was built around the habits of stay-at-home mums, college students, fitness professionals, off-duty models – women who wore exercise clothing outside an exercise setting and who, like ballerinas, have heightened reasons to monitor the market value of their looks. This deep incentive is hidden by a bunch of more obvious ones: these clothes are easy to wear, machine-washable, wrinkle-proof. Athleisure – like all optimization experiences and products – is reliably comfortable and supportive in a world that is not. In 2016, Moira Weigel wrote, at Real Life magazine, “Lululemons announce that for the wearer, life has become frictionless.” She recalls putting on a pair of Spanx shapewear for the first time: “The word for how my casing made me feel was optimized.”Spandex – the material in both Spanx and expensive leggings – was invented during the second world war, when the military was trying to develop new parachute fabrics. It is uniquely flexible, resilient and strong. It feels comforting to wear high-quality dex, but this sense of reassurance is paired with an undercurrent of demand. Shapewear controls the body under clothing athleisure broadcasts your commitment to controlling your body through working out. And to even get into a pair of Lululemons, you have to have a disciplined-looking body. (The founder of the company once said that “certain women” aren’t meant to wear his brand.) “Self-exposure and self-policing meet in a feedback loop,” Weigel wrote. “Because these pants only ‘work’ on a certain kind of body, wearing them reminds you to go out and get that body.”This is how athleisure has carved out the space between exercise apparel and fashion: the former category optimizes your performance, the latter optimizes your appearance, and athleisure does both simultaneously. It is tailor-made for a time when work is rebranded as pleasure so that we will accept more of it – a time when, for women, improving your looks is a job that you’re supposed to believe is fun. And the real trick of athleisure is the way it can physically suggest that you were made to do this – that you’re the kind of person who thinks that putting in expensive hard work for a high-functioning, maximally attractive consumer existence is about as good a way to pass your time on Earth as there is.I recently bought my first pair of Spanx in preparation for a wedding. My oldest friend was getting married in Texas, and the bridesmaids’ dresses – for all 13 of us – were pale pink, floor-length and as tight as shrink-wrap from the strapless neckline to the knees. When I first tried the dress on, I could see the inside of my belly button in the mirror. Frowning, I went online and bought a $98 “Haute Contour® High-Waisted Thong”. It arrived a few days later, and I tried it on with the dress: I couldn’t breathe properly, I immediately started sweating and everything looked even worse. “What the fuck,” I said, staring at my reflection. I looked like a bad imitation of a woman whose most deeply held personal goal was to look hot in pictures. And of course, in that moment, in a $98 punishment thong and a dress designed for an Instagram model, that’s exactly what I was.The ideal woman looks beautiful, happy, carefree and perfectly competent. Is she really? To look any particular way and to actually be that way are two separate concepts, and striving to look carefree and happy can interfere with your ability to feel so. The internet codifies this problem, makes it inescapable in recent years, pop culture has started to reflect the fractures in selfhood that social media creates. Not coincidentally, these stories usually center on women, and usually involve a protagonist driven to insanity by the digital avatar of an ideal peer. There is an exaggerated binary fatalism to these stories, in which women are either successes or failures, always one or the other – and a sense of inescapability that rings more true to life. If you can’t escape the market, why stop working on its terms?Women are genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy – two systems that, at their extremes, ensure that inidual success comes at the expense of collective morality. And yet there is enormous pleasure in inidual success. It can feel like license and agency to approach an ideal, to find yourself – in a good picture, on your wedding day, in a flash of identical movement – exemplifying a prototype. There are rewards for succeeding under capitalism and patriarchy there are rewards even for being willing to work on its terms. There are nothing but rewards, at the surface level. The trap looks beautiful. It’s well-lit. It welcomes you in.There is a case, as laid out by Donna Haraway in her tricky 1985 essay A Cyborg Manifesto, for understanding the female condition as essentially, fundamentally adulterated and for seeking a type of freedom compatible with that state. “At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg,” she wrote. The cyborg was a “hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction”. The late 20th century had “made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.”Haraway imagined that women, formed in a way that makes us inextricable from social and technological machinery, could become fluid and radical and resistant. We could be like cyborgs – shaped in an image we didn’t choose for ourselves, and disloyal and disobedient as a result. “Illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential,” Haraway wrote. The cyborg was “oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence”. She would understand that the terms of her life had always been artificial. She would – and what an incredible possibility! – feel no respect whatsoever for the rules by which her life played out.In real life, women are so much more obedient. Our rebellions are so trivial and small. Lately, the ideal women of Instagram have started chafing, just a little, against the structures that surround them. The anti-Instagram statement is now a predictable part of the modelinfluencer social media life cycle: a beautiful young woman who goes to great pains to maintain and perform her own beauty for an audience will eventually post a note on Instagram revealing that Instagram has become a bottomless pit of personal insecurity and anxiety. She’ll take a week-long break from the social network, and then, almost always, she will go on exactly as before. Resistance to a system is almost always presented on the terms of the system. It’s so much easier, when we gain agency, to use it to adapt rather than to oppose.Technology, in fact, has made us less than oppositional: where beauty is concerned, we have deployed technology not only to meet the demands of the system but to actually expand these demands. The realm of what is possible for women has been exponentially expanding in all beauty-related capacities – think of the extended Kardashian experiments in body modification, or the young models whose plastic surgeons have given them entirely new faces – and remained stagnant in many other ways. We have not “optimized” our wages, our childcare system, our political representation we still hardly even think of parity as realistic in those arenas, let alone anything approaching perfection. We have maximized our capacity as market assets. That’s all.For the way out, I think, we have to follow the cyborg. We have to be willing to be disloyal, to undermine. The cyborg is powerful because she grasps the potential in her own artificiality, because she accepts without question how deeply it is embedded in her. It’s possible if we want it. But what do we want? What would you want – what desires, what forms of insubordination, would you be able to access – if you had succeeded in becoming an ideal woman, gratified and beloved, proof of the efficiency of a system that magnifies and diminishes you every day? • Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino is published by 4th Estate on 8 August.

Tory party would have held it if Brexit party hadn’t taken so many votes, or if GreensPlaid had not stood aside. The Brexit debacle is so serious party politics should take a back seat. Hopefully the progressive alliance will hold and Borish Johnson will be too up himself to get a pact going with Farage. Not sure where Labour fit in the battle of the coalitions, but not a great night for them either. RedSalamanderI’m delighted that a party which unequivocally opposes Brexit won last night.But we shouldn’t get carried away. Johnson will be pretty relieved at how the Conservative vote held up and if you add Conservative and Brexit Party vote share together, then their combined vote is higher than the Lib Dems. He will push the line that if you want Brexit delivered, you have to swing behind the Conservatives.On Labour: nobody is fooled by Corbyn’s ‘“constructive ambiguity” any more. It’s blatantly obvious that he wants Brexit and all his dithering and vagueness is intended to mug off his own party. TheGoodThiefThe remain-alliance’s total votes are less than the Conservative plus Brexit plus UKIP total, so expect plenty of politicians saying that this shows that the Tories need to move to a harder Brexit.More interesting to me is the Brexit politicians who are saying that they wouldn’t vote for a version of the withdrawal agreement without the backstop, showing that Boris Johnson either doesn’t know his own party, or has been lying whenever he’s suggested that a WA without the backstop could pass Parliament. octaariThe polls tell us there is a Boris Johnson bounce – they are back in the lead. And given the circumstances of this by-election, a seat they’d been widely expected to lose heavily from what I’ve read over the past few weeks, the narrow losing margin seems to confirm that.What the result shows is what can be achieved through electoral alliances. The winning margin was about the same as Plaid Cymru’s vote at the last election, and they didn’t stand this time. The Brexit Party’s 3,300 votes would have given the Tories a comfortable majority. Very grim result for Labour. stringvestorThere is still a substantial pro-Brexit vote out there. That is not surprising since we have not yet left the EU and what might happen is still speculation. Whereas we are still in the EU and people can blame everything they do not like on Brussels. Let’s see how the Brexit vote holds up after we have left and the consequences start to kick in.

By common consent, which included the batsman’s own opinion, Rory Burns was not in great form before this Test match, yet there he was settling into his stiff-necked stance in his sixth hour at the crease, defying perspiring Australia bowlers on his way to his maiden Test century. A stunning achievement on a sun-kissed Friday afternoon.Burns, ever more composed during his first experience of Ashes cricket, just kept soldiering on while delivering the innings of his life. He clipped the ball neatly off his legs whenever the opportunity arose he square-cut the off-spin of Nathan Lyon if the ball was dropped short he shuffled into line against the straight ones and was none too bothered when beaten by the wider ones, which was quite frequently especially in the view of exasperated Australian onlookers. He also sliced, carved and edged a few, magically eluding whatever formation of slip cordon Tim Paine had stationed.It was not an elegant innings but who cares? Elegance is unlikely to be a prime consideration for Burns – he may not consider it all – but his system worked wonderfully well. He grafted and scurried in the tradition of faithful left-handed English openers of the past, who were all worthy of admiration even if they did not have latecomers sprinting to the turnstiles: Geoff Pullar, John Edrich and, more recently, Alastair Cook.Burns knows that he has not reached their standards yet. But after an innings of such resolution and phlegm he will now have the chance to enhance his Test career throughout the rest of the summer. His place is secure for a while and just wait until he hits form.These were runs that mattered – against Australia in the opening Test of the series – and they were all the more impressive given his recent form Burns had not passed fifty since the middle of May.It took a while for him to reach those coveted three figures. On 88, he struck a crisp cover drive against Pat Cummins, a stroke as fluent as any that he had played all day but that did not presage a sprint towards his maiden Test century. He did not score for another half an hour. Then there was the odd single and a timely leg glance to the boundary a nudge to the left of mid-on against Lyon and he was there punching the air before being locked in a bear hug with Ben Stokes.The second day was a better one for batting the sun was out, the pitch was a mellower brown yet there seemed to be enough movement to encourage the bowlers in the first hour. After an edged boundary Jason Roy pushed hard at a fine delivery from James Pattinson and the ball sped into the safe hands of Steve Smith at second slip.There were no free runs to be gleaned thereafter. Lyon was introduced early and found some turn. When Burns was on 21 the off-spinner declined to review an lbw appeal that had been rejected by Joel Wilson. The replays revealed that any review would have been successful. Perhaps Australia were not inclined to waste one on a batsman who had been so out of touch.Meanwhile, England’s latest No 3, Joe Root, was always watchful and sometimes tentative. When he was on nine there was a concerted appeal from Pattinson for a catch behind the wicket. Wilson’s finger was raised, Root reviewed and we soon discovered that the ball had indeed touched wood, but it was the wood of the off-stump. Somehow the bail declined to move, which seems to happen ever more frequently.On 14, when facing Peter Siddle, Root sought another immediate review when confronted by Aleem Dar’s finger, correctly confident that the ball had taken a firm inside edge.This was tough, taut fare as England mustered 61 runs in that first session.Runs came more freely after lunch when Root finally began to find the boundary with a series of deft glides and clips while Burns willed himself onward. They had added 136 when Siddle made the breakthrough. A firm‑footed drive from Root sped from the middle of the bat into bowler’s slipway as he followed through. Siddle stuck out his right hand and there the ball came to rest. A pure batsman would have chided himself for not getting on top of the ball, a Botham would have been furious that he had not hit the ball harder and higher.Now the innings faltered. On either side of tea Joe Denly played two delicious cover drives but he fell soon after a ball change – it seemed the replacement was more willing to swing. Denly wisely declined to review when struck on the pads by a full-length delivery from Pattinson.Jos Buttler struck one crisp cover drive before edging to Cameron Bancroft at third slip off Cummins.Stokes now became a trusty ally for Burns. He saw him to three figures and survived the immediate recall of Lyon upon his arrival at the crease, a transparent adherence to some dossier despite the fact the ball was swinging around.Paine took the second new ball as soon as it was available, juggling his bowlers feverishly. This time they tried a review for lbw against Burns to no avail. After five overs Lyon was recalled.Even now England’s opener was not batting flawlessly yet he was still heroically unbeaten at the close with the deficit reduced to 17."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9279c0f7e15c54bed363a145a2a3512ca45e6675/0_102_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e73adb30b38812d2f261a4bf6cb5dd3f","title":"how englands rory burns got his first test century ashes","story":"Happy Burns day. England’s left-handed opener faced the first ball and the last ball on the second day of this first Ashes Test. In between Rory Burns wafted and whooshed, hit a few, edged a few more and batted at times with all the graceful serenity of a man trying to force his way head-first through a privet hedge.At the end of which Burns finished a captivating day on 125 not out, his first hundred for England, and an innings that already seems likely to garland and indeed define his career as a cricketer.As the sun moved steadily across the sky, only one thing seemed to be happening at Edgbaston. Australia bowled to Burns. Burns waited, squinted, squatted suddenly as though fighting a bout of gastric nerves, and repelled the attack.He played horribly at times, did not care and played horribly some more. The ball passed his outside edge at least 30 times. It was urgent, scrappy, dogged and by the end an impossibly precious innings for England’s hopes in this series.There was also a nobility in Australia’s persistence. Bowling all day to Rory Burns: this is both an activity and a statement of fact. Australia were unstinting. Pat Cummins bowled with wonderful heart. The fielding levels never dropped. It was gripping, in the way only this strange, absorbing sport can be. There was even something deeply true to himself about the way Burns brought up that first Test hundred from his 224th ball. Nathan Lyon bowled on middle stump. Burns nudge-plonked it into the leg side and sprinted to the other end, already removing his helmet and punching the air as Joel Wilson signalled for a review, the return having shaved the stumps.It has been a strange couple of days for the starchiest of all the formats. If a passing group of Martians, Venusians or Americans had chosen this first Test to conduct a case study into Test cricket their chief conclusions would be that the way to score runs is to flinch, twitch and shiver around the crease like a startled squirrel.At times at Edgbaston it was tempting to conclude England have found their own Steve Smith, although with Smith the idea is always there of an ascetic purity at the heart of his fidgeting. Not so with Burns who, even as he strikes the ball, still appears to be fighting his way through a swarm of midges, while in the process of realising that his shoes are on fire.Nothing, though, can detract from the value of this innings. Burns came here with his England career teetering on the edge. In midweek he had been back to his roots down at Surrey’s training ground at New Malden. There he could be seen hitting balls in the company of Neil Stewart, brother of Alec, and a straight-talking, mentor-ish figure to that generation of Surrey players. Even here Burns had edged and scratched and plinked his throw downs: perfect preparation, it turned out, for edging and scratching and plinking his way to a vital Ashes hundred.At the start all eyes had been glued to the former Whitgift schoolboy opening in his first Ashes Test. Naturally this was not Burns but the more upright Jason Roy. Coming up through the Surrey age groups it was Roy who was the star, the flashing blade. Burns was a wicket-keeper and occasionally an off-spinner. There were no England camps or A Tours but the runs continued to churn in county cricket, right up to the unignorable peaks of last season.Roy looked in no bother at all until the moment he was out, pushing at a good ball from James Pattinson. As Burns rebuilt with Joe Root there was an early moment of peril as Cummins struck him on the helmet. After lunch he should have been given out lbw to Nathan Lyon. Australia did not review.And early on it took a while to adjust to the movements of the Burns head. As the bowler runs in he rotates his neck as he appears to be looking beyond mid-on. It is a conscious tick, Burns trying to line up his stronger eye, his left, with the far edge of the stumps. At times he looked as though he was about to turn his head full circle, like an owl or a demonically possessed 1970s child. There was some talk of Burns playing the ball a little closer to himself. Only he will really know the extent of this. What is certain is he knows how to make runs, finding a surprising power out of that late cock of the wrists. His 50 came up in the 32nd over with a tickle fine to the rope off Nathan Lyon.It was against Lyon that Burns really showed the worth of his innings. He played him late. He leapt back when he could. Most of all he provided a bulwark. Lyon has tortured England’s left-handers at various stages. But then, what was he going to do to Burns, who already looks like he’s in agony, who came here pre-tortured, but who kept drawing Lyon in and then picking him off.The nineties were painful at times. One Cummins over saw Burns play and miss – great whooshing misses – four times. All that mattered was he got there. Non-ennobled England openers have not prospered in Ashes Tests recently. Sir Alastair Cook ground away into his dotage but Mark Stoneman never got past 56, Michael Carberry peaked at 60 against a great attack and Adam Lyth did not get past 19.Burns will draw huge strength from his innings, just as England look to have built a position of strength around its armature. Whatever happens from here this will remain a self-contained moment of triumph for the man with the flinch and the crouch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/116708311aa8f850207ae3b565a51f2b18dbe664/0_0_5080_3048/master/5080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b908cdf0b7bf763e1cf0fba93023b7f3","title":"huddersfield leeds super league rugby match report","story":"In the most closely contested relegation battle in Super League history results are really all that matters. In that regard this was job done for Leeds – but, given the miserable season the eight-time champions have endured hitherto, this magnificent performance is cause for celebration and optimism for everyone connected with the club.Leeds are only two points clear of bottom-placed London but there were enough traits here to suggest the unlikeliest of relegations for one of the game’s most famous clubs is looking less likely.“I see a team we’re not having to pick up off the floor any more,” the Leeds coach, Richard Agar, said after this destructive display.In hindsight Leeds had done enough by half-time to see off a miserable Huddersfield side, who remain only one win clear of the relegation zone themselves. Tries from Adam Cuthbertson, Tom Briscoe and Konrad Hurrell made it 16-0 to the visitors, before Brad Dwyer’s instinctive finish on the stroke of the interval gave them a commanding 22-point lead. There would be no way back from there for the Giants.“One team looked like they were fighting for survival and the other didn’t,” Simon Woolford, the Huddersfield coach, said. “It’s embarrassing and simply unacceptable.”His side had to score first after half-time to stand any chance of victory – but instead, a shocking pass in midfield found its way to Ash Handley, who raced 50 metres unchallenged to put the game out of sight. Leeds only got better after that.Hurrell’s second, a rampaging solo effort, came next before two wonderful team tries in the closing minutes. The first was finished by Handley, before a superb break downfield led to Liam Sutcliffe crossing in the corner to put the seal on a performance that suggests Leeds have enough to survive, irrespective of what happens around them.Wakefield remain on 18 points with Leeds and Huddersfield after suffering a 26-6 defeat at St Helens, who could win the League Leaders’ Shield on Saturday should Warrington lose to Catalans.Huddersfield McIntosh McGillvary, I Senior, Wardle, L Senior Gaskell, Frawley Walne, Leeming, English, Ta’ai, Mellor, Lawrence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741fbf4d5e922c81bd101d5d11ed6084adf12a29/0_135_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bccbe12fbd9840376e86b229e8972a24","title":"rory burns 2005 ashes winners century england australia","story":"• ‘I was ready to run through a brick wall,’ says England opener• Steve Waugh tells Australia batsman to watch and learnRory Burns tasted the sweet success of a maiden Test century against Australia after an evening with members of England’s 2005 Ashes-winning team that left him feeling ready to run through a brick wall.Batting through the second day of the first Test for an unbeaten 125 that leaves England only 17 runs behind with six wickets in hand, Burns displayed all the obdurate qualities that many feared would be lost to England’s top order when his fellow left-hander Alastair Cook retired at the end of last summer.But despite a low-key start as the direct replacement for England’s record run-scorer – he averaged 22 from seven caps and had made 12 runs across two innings against Ireland – a session with his old juniors coach, Neil Stewart, and an evening with such as Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell proved inspirational.Burns, who left the field to a standing ovation and handshakes from the Australians, said: “To be an Ashes cricketer in the first place is a wonderful thing. We connected with some past players, some of the 2005 winners the night before the Test and I was literally ready to run through a brick wall and get right in amongst it.“The night before I probably played my first ball a few times and probably celebrated a hundred a few times. To get over the line today is a wonderful feeling.”What has so far stuck out over the course of 402 minutes at the crease is Burns’ ability to reset between deliveries, not least while spending nearly an hour in the 90s – a period when England lost Joe Denly and Jos Buttler at the other end.The 28-year-old thanked Edgbaston’s rowdy Hollies Stand for keeping him going during that time, with the crowd singing his name to the tune of Cook’s old song before a sprinted single off Nathan Lyon sealed his three figures for the first time in Test cricket.Burns added: “My general thought when I was on 99 and Lyon started bowling handy stuff was trying to talk myself out of sweeping him. I was just trying to stay level and almost wait for the ball that was in my area just to tickle somewhere. To get over the line there with a quick dash, that will be a pretty special memory.”Australia were left to regret their failure to review an lbw shout from Lyon when Burns was on 21 – the ball was shown to be hitting leg stump – something Steve Waugh, who is acting as a mentor on this tour, accepted after the close. Burns will doubtless appreciate the former Australia captain’s assessment of his batting, not least when saying some of the tourists should take note.Waugh said: “His concentration was excellent. It’s not about how good you look, it’s how many runs you get. It was a good innings for some of our players to look at and learn.“I know myself, when you’re playing on tough Test match wickets and someone scores runs in the opposition, it would be smart to analyse how they went about it.

In fact, Mr Gum and the Dancing Bear, which children’s author Andy Stanton has adapted himself, is downright bizarre. It is packed with eccentric details and excessive verbal flourishes. It’s an approach that has served Stanton well in his popular books, but is tricky to pull off in the theatre. Time and again, quirky detail is prioritised over clarity of storytelling. Distinctive? Yes. But disappointing.The creative team is a strong one. Amy Hodge recently directed an ambitious Mother Courage Georgia Lowe has designed sets for some startling productions including Equus and An Octoroon and Jim Fortune composed the music for the National’s extraordinary community production of Pericles. But this exciting group of theatre-makers have created relatively little children’s theatre, and their lack of experience shows.The one aspect that lands is the visuals. Lowe worked on The Twits and there is a whiff of Roald Dahl to her designs, vivid and flecked with danger. We first meet Mr Gum (Steve Furst) and his sidekick Billy (Helena Lymber) at a butcher’s, where a blood-splattered carcass hangs overhead. When Mr Gum steals a lonely Bear and drags him to the docks, determined to make his fortune, the costumes turn crimson, bold and a little bit sexy. Later, when young Polly (Keziah Joseph) releases Bear in the Kingdom of Beasts, a canopy of green umbrellas blooms above us. Jimmy Grimes’s Bear puppet is made up of raggedy brown scraps, a lost toy waiting to be found and loved.The set manages to connect with the story – but that’s about it. Stanton’s lyrics are wordy and quirky but lack punch. They also land at the strangest of moments. There’s a song about snacks and another about tummy rumblings and there is nothing Jim Fortune’s big, bold score can do to make either feel significant. Stanton’s book is also heavy with irony and in-jokes, brimming with ersions but little direction. When Polly is stranded out at sea, her big number includes the line: ‘This is the saddest song in the show!’ The quip generates a few giggles but it also sucks the feeling, and focus, right out of the production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692542d99875470c453103120c1637991a1cf6e3/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e4102ddd0664bca65fe91989481b95","title":"rich kids a history of shopping malls in tehran review traverse edinburgh","story":"Traverse, EdinburghJavaad Alipoor’s kaleidoscopic show delves below the compellingly shocking behaviour to lay bare an epoch-ning vision of human wasteThe sensation of racing a high-performance car along a swanky boulevard in Tehran is surely akin to watching this high-tech, high-octane production by Javaad Alipoor and Kirsty Housley. With our phones open on Instagram as well as seeing images projected on stage, we’re subjected to a fact-laden, multimedia collage – all hashtags, live feeds and rapid scrolling – almost overwhelming in its detail.The form suggests the sensory overload of a young and wealthy elite, the kind who, like Chatunga Mugabe, son of Robert, might find it entertaining to pour champagne over a priceless watch simply because they can.Engagingly played by Alipoor and Peyvand Sadeghian, Rich Kids is about more than the excessive consumption of the rich offspring of Iran’s revolutionary elite, however. Their behaviour is compellingly shocking, not least given the principles of their parents and the standards of a country where alcohol, let alone cocaine, is outlawed for Muslim citizens. But in his kaleidoscopic script, Alipoor delves below the horrifying Made in Chelsea-style glamour to create an epoch-ning vision of human waste.Using Instagram as an analogy for archaeology, each picture taking us a step further into the past, he whisks us back to the age of portrait painting, in which the rich made Insta-like memorials to their own wealth, and then further into geological time.

It has also committed to adding the ability for users to opt out of the quality assurance scheme altogether in a future software update.Apple said: “We are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy. While we conduct a thorough review, we are suspending Siri grading globally. Additionally, as part of a future software update, users will have the ability to choose to participate in grading.”Contractors working for Apple in Ireland said they were not told about the decision when they arrived for work on Friday morning, but were sent home for the weekend after being told the system they used for the grading “was not working” globally. Only managers were asked to stay on site, the contractors said, adding that they had not been told what the suspension means for their future employment.The suspension was prompted by a report in the  last week that revealed the company’s contractors “regularly” hear confidential and private information while carrying out the grading process, including in-progress drug deals, medical details and people having sex.The bulk of that confidential information was recorded through accidental triggers of the Siri digital assistant, a whistleblower told the . The Apple Watch was particularly susceptible to such accidental triggers, they said. “The regularity of accidental triggers on the watch is incredibly high … The watch can record some snippets that will be 30 seconds – not that long, but you can gather a good idea of what’s going on.Sometimes, the Apple contractor said, “you can definitely hear a doctor and patient, talking about the medical history of the patient. Or you’d hear someone, maybe with car engine background noise – you can’t say definitely, but it’s a drug deal … you can definitely hear it happening. And you’d hear, like, people engaging in sexual acts that are accidentally recorded on the pod or the watch.”Although Apple told users that Siri data may be used “to help Siri … understand you better and recognise what you say”, the company did not explicitly disclose that this entailed human contractors listening to a random selection of Siri recordings, including those triggered accidentally.“Too often we see that so-called ‘smart assistants’ are in fact eavesdropping, said Silkie Carlo, the director of the UK campaign group Big Brother Watch. “We also see that they often collect and use people’s personal information in ways that people do not know about and cannot control.”She added: “Apple’s record on privacy is really slipping. The current iOS does not allow users to opt out of face recognition on photos, and this revelation about Siri means our iPhones were listening to us without our knowledge.”The company is not alone in taking flak for its undisclosed quality assurance programmes. Both Amazon and Google also use contractors to check the quality of their voice assistants, according to reports in Bloomberg and on the Belgian TV channel VRT, and contractors from both companies have expressed discomfort at the nature of overheard recordings.The revelation of Google’s programme in particular caused concern due to the fact the news report was accompanied by a leak of more than 1,000 audio clips, revealing that at least one in 10 had been captured accidentally.That prompted the data protection commissioner for Hamburg in Germany to ban Google from carrying out those checks for three months, citing a likely breach of the general data protection regulation (GDPR). The commissioner cited an “urgent need to protect the rights and freedoms” of Google Home users in enacting the temporary ban, which would otherwise be the responsibility of the Irish data protection commissioner, the lead controller for Google, as well as Apple, in the EU. Google says it had already ceased the practice on 10 July, when it learned about the leak of audio clips.Amazon and Apple escaped the ban, Hamburg’s commissioner said, because those companies have their German head offices in Munich and are thus covered by a different commissioner under that country’s privacy laws. But the commissioner called on other regulators to “quickly check for other providers of language assistance systems, such as Apple or Amazon, to implement appropriate measures”.Amazon is the only major provider of voice assistant technology still using humans to check recordings in the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f4284f3a7cea4b823b2267be1820fb4648b39/1181_1041_3639_2184/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e282be98d954c046b234a79e2ded070","title":"deafness its part of who you are one mans journey to inspire","story":"Ed Rex has enjoyed some memorable travel experiences over the years. He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

What is it about malts, bourbons and blends that inspires such dedication?Few drinks inspire the way whisky does. Proud Scottish writer and raconteur Compton Mackenzie declared: “Love makes the world go round? Not at all. Whisky makes it go round twice as fast.” And Irish playwright and activist George Bernard Shaw romantically described whisky as “liquid sunshine”.While it’s easy to conjure the image of the spirit being swilled by middle-aged men wearing tweed the truth is that whisky’s appeal knows no boundaries. It’s been the go-to drink of celebrities (as well as politicians) for decades. Everyone from Kate Moss - who once threw a Burns Night party in a hotel that stocks 1,000 bottles - to Hollywood royalty such as Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, to Margaret Thatcher, have been keen fans … and they know it’s much more than just a drink. Tobermory whisky holds true to that philosophy. Born and distilled on the Isle of Mull, it’s a homage to the rich palate of its Hebridean home, where creativity and nature exist side by side.Tobermory’s spirit is rich with character and culture, like some of history’s most expressive whisky-lovers. Here’s what they have to say about one of life’s finest pleasures.Ol’ Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra enjoyed a whisky on stage during his shows - so much so he was even buried with a bottle in 1998. He famously said: “Alcohol may be man’s worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.”It’s no wonder his second wife, Ava Gardner, loved it too. She once said: “I wish to live to 150 years old, but the day I die, I wish it to be with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of whiskey in the other.”According to some – although this is much contested – Humphrey Bogart’s last words were: “I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.”Winston Churchill drank a whisky and soda every day at 11am. During the war in India, he said: “The water was not fit to drink. To make it palatable, we had to add whisky. By diligent effort, I learned to like it.”Margaret Thatcher also enjoyed whisky and soda, believing it gave her strength. “You must have whisky to give you energy,” she said.Carry On legend Sid James kept bottles to hand on set, after quickly learning he got sent freebies if he could sneak them into shot. Shortly after James’s death, Les Dawson was in the dressing room of the theatre where James had collapsed when he saw a ghostly apparition – and the room began to smell of whisky.Fancying a lifestyle change, their pal Tommy Cooper once joked: “I’m on a whisky diet. I’ve lost three days already.”Mark Twain, author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, was also in the “less is more” camp – until it came to the spirit. “Too much of anything is bad,” he declared, “but too much good whiskey is barely enough.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f0fa2b4ea4e1c3f98d062934e95a3b9240e4a1f/1183_815_2317_1390/master/2317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47c656fa89cbc6456eb98133f24c8606","title":"offsetting carbon emissions how to travel options","story":"More and more people are trying to offset their travel emissions – so why isn’t it straightforward? We explain the options and how to navigate themHere’s the problem: in two months’ time I must travel to Malawi in southern Africa to help Gumbi Education, a small, -led kids’ education charity that I chair. There’s no Skype option, no railways or boats, and travelling 3,000 miles across Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania by bus is not recommended.I’ve cut my annual holiday flights, I’ve reduced my work travel, and my carbon footprint is nothing to what it was. But realistically, I must fly the 10,200 miles to and from Lilongwe – and I want to offset my emissions in some way. If done correctly, this should mean that I do less harm overall.But what I thought would be easy to arrange has proved a minefield. There is no agreement on how much carbon dioxide a journey may emit, confusion about what actions best reduce emissions, a huge choice of where to direct your money, and growing cynicism as airlines, airports and giant carbon-greedy corporations use offsetting to sell more flights or get permission to grow even further.A decade ago, the voluntary carbon offset market was tiny, unsophisticated and largely unregulated. The little money raised was aimed at worthwhile projects, but few schemes to cut emissions or promote development were verified or certified. Exposés, the financial crash and painfully slow progress in the UN climate talks all helped discourage iniduals and companies from offsetting.But as awareness of the climate crisis has grown, corporates in particular have turned to voluntary offsetting and sent the market mainstream. Small companies have been weeded out, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been set up, and thousands of participating companies and charities are now theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers.As the climate emergency grows, so too does the money involved – and the need for accountability.Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. One tonne of carbon is usually the equivalent of one credit and the market for these credits, worth possibly a few tens of millions of dollars in 2007, is now valued at over $500m a year and growing fast.This is equivalent to more than all of Australia’s energy-related emissions in 2016, according to Forest Trends, a New York-based conservation finance company that tracks carbon offset projects. The company’s report, Voluntary Carbon Markets Insights, says: “Demand for voluntary carbon offsets has grown … from just 0.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2008 to 42.8 million tonnes in 2018.”Sarah Leugers, communications director of the Geneva-based nonprofit Gold Standard, which was set up by environment group WWF, says that – paradoxically – Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement transformed the market, with companies and iniduals all now wanting to do the right thing in contrast.As the market matures, so the choice of ways to offset emissions increases. You can now offset rail, road and air journeys, your stay in a holiday hotel, your daily commute, your home heating – indeed you could offset the emissions of your whole life.You could have a forest of banana trees or avocados planted in Kenya, reduce the amount of methane emitted from an Indonesian waste dump, provide fresh water to Malawians, rewild Romania or reforest areas of the Amazon basin home to communities of indigenous peoples.Today, the big offset certifiers such as American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo and Verra offer many hundreds of projects. To make it even more complex, the carbon price of these projects depends on where they are and the benefits they offer. Standards of verification also vary but in general are considered to be much tighter in Europe than the US.The problem is knowing what is best. Tree planting is theoretically highly effective but some offset schemes have attracted criticism for displacing people or creating monocultures wind and solar power projects are usually widely welcomed on a community level capturing methane gas from waste tips and landfill sites makes total sense but is hardly attractive and energy efficiency works best with the profligate rich. All schemes have pluses and minuses.“Offsetting must go hand in hand with an ambitious internal reduction strategy,” says Leugers. “The first priority should always be to reduce your own footprint before offsetting, but the reality is that not every inidual or business can do that quickly.“Business is putting in more money, but the number of people acting inidually is growing significantly. We have 1,500 projects in the pipeline. We don’t choose them NGOs come to us. They are all independently verified. The best advice I can give is to always look for the underlying standards.”Robert Stevens of Climate Care agrees: “Until we reach a zero-carbon world … paying to reduce an equivalent amount of carbon emissions through voluntary offsetting is the most cost-effective, quickest and efficient way of doing this.” But even trying to establish how much you emit on a journey is hard. Some offsetters take into account the extra impact of flying at an altitude above 35,000 feet others look at the age of the aircraft type you are likely to fly in, whether you travel business class, any stop-off points and how full the plane is likely to be. As the market grows, it throws up anomalies and prompts accusations that it legitimises the growth of emissions. Twenty-nine of the most fuel-profligate airlines, including Emirates, Delta, BA, Air Canada and Gulf, now offer to offset their customers’ flights, and 15 airlines now voluntarily offset their own emissions in some capacity.This allows Heathrow – which hopes that with a third runway it will be able to take an extra 265,000 flights a year – to say that it plans to use offsets to make it “carbon neutral” by 2030 and to be “zero-carbon” by 2050, even though it will build one of the world’s largest car parks and directly increase global emissions by millions of tonnes of CO2.This is wholly disingenuous, says Green MP Caroline Lucas, who describes Heathrow as “taking economy with the truth to new levels”.But there’s no doubt that companies, iniduals, nonprofit groups, even cities are now using offsets to go “carbon-neutral” or even “zero carbon”. Liverpool is working with Malta-based blockchain nonprofit Poseidon to offset emissions with projects in Africa and brands such as Disney, Microsoft, Lyft, Apple, Aviva and Sony have pledged to use offsets to become climate neutral.The bottom line is that to offset emissions, it is now possible to pay almost what you want to whom you want (though it is surprisingly difficult to calculate cruise ship emissions). The key to gauging the large-scale projects favoured by companies is to ascertain that they are real, measurable, independently verified and permanent, and would not have taken place without the finance provided by the sale of credits.Ideally, say observers, travellers should check to see whether they offer verified emission reduction (VER) credits, as offered by Gold Standard.The other approach is to use DIY offsets. This involves working out your emissions using an online calculator (see calculator tool above), then finding a project that roughly compensates (for example Gold Standard). Or you could just donate to an organisation working to suck up carbon or generate renewable energy. Many admirable environmental projects run by small energy and conservation groups do excellent work on tree planting and clean energy without always offering credits – just contributing would effectively help offset emissions. Forests Without Frontiers in Romania, Tree Aid and the Woodland Trust are personal favourites.Offsetting can work, and it allows people who have to travel to do so with a clearer conscience. But the best strategy must be to reduce your own emissions first.For his 10,200-mile round London to Lilongwe round-trip via Nairobi, John asked eight offsetting companies to calculate his CO2 emissions, how much they would cost to offset, and where the money goes.

It is not uncommon for Hindu pilgrims to be targeted – seven were killed in a bus attack in 2017 – but an order asking people to leave is rare.Kashmir is claimed by India and Pakistan in full and ruled in part by both. An insurgency has waxed and waned on the Indian-administered side for three decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed.On Friday, an improvised explosive device hit an Indian army vehicle in southern Pulwama district while a gunfight raged in nearby Shopian district.A series of orders leaked last week caused alarm in the region. One told Indian Railways staff in the Kashmir valley to stock enough dry rations to last four months and referred to a “forecast of deteriorating situation”.The influx of 10,000 extra troops also prompted rumours that Delhi may be preparing to scrap Kashmir’s special status, which prohibits people from outside of the state from buying land in the disputed territory.“The deployment of troops is a very significant move, and this usually happens when the government is anticipating a law and order situation,” said Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. “There is a significant degree of panic among the people because they have no clarity on what is really going to happen.”Umar, a state government employee who was willing to be identified only by his first name, said people were living in a state of uncertainty. He said he was due to get married later this month but was worried he might be forced to cancel the wedding.“Within the family we are discussing what to do. We have options to cut short the functions and make the ceremony as quick as possible, but we are also unsure at this point if that is even possible,” he said.Amid the confusion, residents have rushed to ATMs to withdraw money and long queues have formed outside petrol stations.Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has promised to scrap article 35A of the Indian constitution, which protects the demography of Muslim-majority Kashmir by prohibiting non-state subjects from buying land.However, analysts say doing so would almost certainly trigger unrest and reignite tensions with Pakistan, and that the government would be unlikely to take such action during the Amarnath Yatra, which ends in mid-August.In February, more than 40 Indian paramilitaries were killed in a suicide car bombing that brought India and Pakistan close to a war. Since then, there has been a decrease in incidents, but the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, who headed an alliance government with the BJP, described the situation as “disconcerting” and warned of a misinformation campaign.On Friday, India’s external affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, again rejected Donald Trump’s offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir. The US president’s claim last month that Modi had asked him to intervene was quickly denied by Delhi, where it fuelled anger in parliament.Jaishankar said he told the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who he met on the sidelines of an Asian security forum in Bangkok, that any talks over the disputed region would be between India and Pakistan only. Trump had reiterated his offer to intervene on Thursday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3975614.1564763191!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk hopes for quick us trade deal are pie in brexit sky","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump has said he wants an ‘ambitious free-trade agreement’ with the UK after Brexit. File photograph: Kevin LamarqueReutersThis week the issue of Brexit made it across the Atlantic as members of US Congress voiced their concern about its impact on Northern Ireland.As the new British government veers closer to a no-deal scenario, concern is growing among the politically influential Irish-American lobby about the implications for the Belfast Agreement.On Monday a powerful bipartisan group of former members of Congress and ambassadors wrote to new Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith expressing alarm about the rhetoric from London.“We remain deeply concerned given the new Prime Minister’s recent statement in the Commons that there can be no Irish Backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement, even one with a time limit,” the letter states. “The Irish Border must remain open and seamless so that we can maintain the peace that we all have worked so hard to achieve together.”Current members of Congress are also watching with increasing unease as Britain appears to move closer to a no-deal. Richard Neal, the chair of the ways and means committee, which oversees trade policy, warned Boris Johnson that “this is not about a return to empire”.His intervention follows comments by House speaker Nancy Pelosi in which she said that Congress will not endorse a trade agreement between the United States and the UK if the Belfast Agreement is jeopardised.ComplexitiesThe new government in Britain gained some comfort from comments made by president Donald Trump last week after his first phone call with Johnson as prime minister. Trump said he wanted an “ambitious free-trade agreement” between the two countries, with formal talks to begin “as soon as possible after Britain leaves the EU”.But despite his lofty promises the political realities of striking a trade deal between the two countries is infinitely more complex.Firstly, as Neal pointed out, the legislative branch of government plays a key role in trade agreements. “Presidents don’t write trade agreements, members of Congress do,” he said. It was a point underlined by former congressmen Bruce Morrison and Jim Walsh. “As former members of Congress we can assure you that getting any trade deal through the Congress is challenging at any time,” they warned.In addition to Irish-American concerns about the return of a hard border, the backstop complicates the matter in other ways. As a recent paper by the UK Trade Policy Observatory run by the University of Sussex and Chatham House notes, the inclusion of the backstop as set out in the withdrawal agreement would constrain a potential UK-US agreement. Noting that one of the key variables in the negotiation of a new bilateral trade agreement “will be the UK’s degree of regulatory and tariff alignment with the EU”, the paper asserts that the level-playing-field requirements set out in the backstop proposal would limit the potential of a US-UK trade deal, at least in terms of goods.The paper concludes that “a quick and economically significant outcome to US-UK trade negotiations seems unlikely”.While formal negotiations between the UK and US cannot start until Britain leaves the EU, a joint working group has been meeting informally to discuss negotiating priorities.Although Britain has been vague about its red lines, the Trump administration has not. The office of the US trade representatives has set out ambitious objectives, including slashing tariff and non-tariff barriers on food and decreasing regulatory ergence – demands that many fear could allow chlorinated chicken or “hormone” beef into the UK.The US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, sparked alarm recently in Britain by suggesting that the NHS would be “on the table” in any negotiations, by allowing American companies to bid for contracts in the public sector.Dominic Raab is expected in Washington next week for his first official visit as foreign secretary, with trade expected to top the agenda. Despite the display of bonhomie between Trump and Johnson, relations between the two countries at official level are difficult following the departure of UK ambassador Kim Darroch.Johnson may boast about the special relationship, but the realities of US trade policy mean that agreement on a bilateral trade deal will be an uphill battle.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They also give women more control over family affairs, making them eligible to be legal s to children, register births, marriages and orces, and be issued legal documents, rather than having a male  do so on their behalf.  The move comes amidst high international scrutiny over Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, and widespread media attention after several young women fled the country this year, asking for asylum and protection from their families. About | Human rights in Saudi Arabia“These new regulations…call for the equal engagement of women and men in our society.”Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler, presents himself as a reformer and has slowly eroded ship system since he came to power.In 2018 he lifted the ban on women driving in the Kingdom, and allowed women to attend university and seek employment without male permission.Last year, however, the government rounded up and imprisoned the country’s leading women’s rights activists. The country has also faced censure by the UN and foreign governments over the state-sponsored murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.“They’re using these reforms as concessions to the international community, to prop up an image,” says Taif Al Khudary of MENA Rights Group.Saudi Arabia lifted a driving ban for women last year“If they were really committed to women’s rights, they would release the women who fought for these rights for years and have been in prison for over a year now.”It is not yet clear when the new rules will become law. Similar legal changes in the country have been difficult to implement in the past, requiring the rewriting of generations of tradition in Saudi families.Remaining ship rules still require consent from a male  for a woman to marry, and bar women from passing their citizenship on to their children, or allowing their children to marry. They also require male permission to leave prison or a domestic violence shelter, meaning in many cases a woman who has sought shelter from a male  who is abusing her can only leave the facility if that same  agrees to collect her.Activists point out that while the changes are welcome, these are very small concessions given that women are still considered minors under Saudi law. “Whilst women can drive now, it’s important to remember that they still need a male chaperone to go places,” says Al Khudary.“So now they can apply for a passport and travel, but they still need a male  to agree to chaperone them to the airport or they can’t actually get there.”Vicar banned from the clergy for life after affair with married parishioner which saw pair exchange \u0026#39sordid\u0026#39 textsCaledonian Sleeper investigation after train overshoots its platformKillers and kidnappers receiving thousands of pounds in benefits while being detained by the stateDominic Cummings is direct and decisive, but he\u0026#39s not the devil\u0026#39: the verdict from inside No 10 on the PM\u0026#39s chief strategistComment: A justice system that allows an innocent man\u0026#39s reputation to be trashed is not fit for purposeComment: Donald Trump and Boris Johnson can forge one-of-a-kind free trade deal after BrexitTax on tech giants will rule out trade deal, US warns BritainHow innovative Hong Kong protesters are using lasers, traffic cones and parkour in battle with policeBoris Johnson \u0026#39has no intention\u0026#39 of making Brexit Party pact – as two dozen Tory MPs consider quitting over no-deal planWhaley Bridge: Boris Johnson says dam is \u0026#39dodgy but stable\u0026#39 after arriving to support residentsComment: Grief-stricken Remainers have unforgivablyDams are deadly - why saving Whaley Bridge dam is so criticalComment: The Reformation was the making of modern Britain.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018Siri, Apple’s iconic voice assistant, allows users to work their iPhone without using their hands, and can send messages, make calls and open multiple applications with voice commands alone.Consumers have become accustomed to calling out names for popular voice assistants, such as Amazon Inc’s Alexa, Google Inc’s Google Assistant, among others.In an effort to perform quality checks and improve the voice assistant’s responses, contractors graded Siri’s answers to user queries. They also looked at whether the response was triggered accidentally, without a deliberate query from the user, the newspaper said.Amazon, which operates the hugely-popular Alexa assistant, is yet to make a similar commitment to Apple and Google, despite admitting in April that\u0026nbspemployees can listen to customer voice recordings\u0026nbspfrom Echo and other Alexa-enabled smart speakers.“This information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone,” Amazon said in a statement at the time.“We have strict technical and operational safeguards, and have a zero tolerance policy for the abuse of our system.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

What they do\u0026nbspknow is that the\u0026nbsproad ahead is\u0026nbsplooking\u0026nbsprockier by the day.\u0026nbspCarney reiterated that the Bank’s forecasts and projections are still predicated on a deal getting done, which is still more or less official government policy. But they’ve been downgraded, in part reflective of the fact that the UK economy has started to seize up as a result of all the uncertainty. \u0026nbspIn the meantime, he and his people have done their best to ensure that, for example, the banking system will be able to cope with the hard shock of a no-deal outcome. The big ones are pretty well capitalised. Hopefully we’ll avoid an RBS or HBOS 2.0 if the yucky stuff hits the fan courtesy of the Conservative Party’s descent into a nationalist pit and its determination to break the country on the back of its fevered fantasies.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Some of them are showing real signs of strain and, as Northern Rock graphically demonstrated, it only takes a small bank tipping up to create a very big mess.At least consumers are behaving in a “prudent manner”.

Brexit turmoil was blamed for the fall, alongside a world economy undermined by trade tensions. On this measure, UK manufacturing has now shrunk for three consecutive months.\u0026nbspDowning Street and the Treasury declined to respond to Mr Carney’s comments, citing the need to respect central bank independence.\u0026nbspBut Peter\u0026nbspDowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury,\u0026nbspsaid the inflation report gave “a bird’s eye view of the mess the Tories have made of our economy, with slumping business investment, weak productivity, stagnant pay, and stuttering growth”.And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspsaid: “It is perfectly clear Brexit is already harming our economy: the manufacturing sector is nearing record lows and the pound is trapped in stark decline. How can the Tory government claim they can end austerity and grow the economy when their policy of Brexit is pushing it to the brink?“The Liberal Democrat message is now more urgent than ever: give the people a final say, stop Brexit, and with the country back on track, fix the economy. Stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital, but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.”Labour MP\u0026nbspRachel Reeves, the chair of the House of Commons Business Committee,\u0026nbspsaid it was “pure recklessness” on the part of the government that it had not ruled out no deal.The £2.1bn committed by Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the chancellor, to no-deal preparations on Wednesday should be spent on reversing benefit cuts and investing in schools and hospitals, “not shoring up the defences against a tsunami”, said Ms Reeves.Minutes of the Wednesday meeting of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, released at the same time as the forecasts, showed that the\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbsphad voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.“The\u0026nbspMPC\u0026nbspjudges that underlying GDP growth is likely to remain subdued over the coming year, with Brexit-related uncertainties weighing on spending to a greater extent than in May,” the\u0026nbspBoE\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspSpeaking to reporters, Mr Carney pointed out that business investment – which accounts for just over 9 per cent of Britain’s GDP – remains low both historically and compared with other countries.\u0026nbspPointing to another constraint on investment that is likely to persist beyond October, he noted that in recent months companies have grown less certain about Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU, with a long-term free trade agreement likely to take “some time” to negotiate. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A section of the dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir in Derbyshire has collapsed following heavy rainfall in the areaA collapsed bridge near Grinton, North Yorkshire, after parts of the region had up to 82.2mm of rain in 24 hours on TuesdayAcrobats Beren d\u0027Amico, Louis Gift and Charlie Wheeller, from Barely Methodical Troupe perform a routine on Calton Hill in Edinburgh as they bring their debut show Bromance to the Edinburgh FringeTheresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced. This lasted until the end of March, but was extended until September, and was finally made permanent.Ofgem said the decision was made because it recognised customers on Good Energy\u0027s standard variable tariff (SVT) had chosen to be on it, unlike customers who have been on SVTs for several years without necessarily knowing.Officials added that the support for renewables provided by the extra cash is “materially greater” than “regulatory mechanisms”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity. In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety.

compared with the price cap average of £1,254.Suppliers who claim to offer “100 per cent\u0026nbspgreen” energy tend to buy the majority of their electricity on wholesale markets, then buy certificates called “REGOs”, which guarantee the equal amount of electricity created from fossil fuels is matched by renewable generation.However, Good Energy uses power purchase agreements, which involve buying electricity directly from wind farm and solar generators.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning about future of civilisation as he demands ‘practical solutions’ to combat climate changeSir David Attenborough has issued a stark warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Founder and chief executive of Good Energy, Juliet Davenport, said: “Our tariffs genuinely support the growth of renewables and clean technologies. And because our customers have actively chosen to contribute to that support.“If we are going to tackle climate breakdown, iniduals must be empowered to choose to be part of the solution. We know customers want the ability to make that choice, and recently it has been complicated by energy companies taking shortcuts to offer cheap \u0027green\u0027 tariffs.”Regulator Ofgem had initially given Good Energy a temporary exemption in January when the cap was introduced.

Would it have consciousness? And what happens if these stem cells turn into sperm cells?But Estrella Nunez, of Murcia Catholic University (UCAM) and the project collaborator, said mechanisms were put in place so that if human cells did migrate to the brain, they would self-destruct.The results are very promising, Ms Nunez said.The research, which was financed largely by the university, was costly. “If we combine the humanpig, humanrat and humanmonkey research, it is many hundreds of thousands of euros,” she said.Dr Raya said scientists have traditionally set a “red line” at 14 days’ gestation, which is not long enough for the embryo to develop a human central nervous system. All chimera embryos are destroyed before that time.Juan Carlos Izpisua, who created the world\u0027s first human-pig hybrid in 2017 and led the latest experiment, said: “We are now trying not only to move forward and continue experimenting with human cells and rodent and pig cells, but also with non-human primates. Our country is a pioneer and a world leader in these investigations.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a remake that could have felt indulgent in the hands of people less skilled, she more than justifies its existence.”“Late Night is a caustic satirical comedy that turns into an unlikely tearjerker. It’s by turns snide and uplifting, and often very funny too. Its writerproducerstar Mindy Kaling makes vicious observations about the inanity, narcissism and corruption of the mainstream US media at the same time as she celebrates the professionalism of many of those who work within it.“Olivia Wilde is a visually inventive director, who keeps the tempo here so brisk that we hardly notice how glib the storytelling sometimes becomes. We can tell exactly how the film will end, but it still feels original both in its screwball energy and in the deft way it continually reverses stereotypes and gender clichés.” “Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab626 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.1926 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest. Who ever would believe a story about a wrestling family from Norwich could have quite such heart and resonance?Doppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.Natalie Portman gives her fiercest, most memorable performance since Black Swan in Brady Corbet’s enjoyably subversive satire about a troubled pop star whose loss of innocence mirrors the fall from grace of the US itself. Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.Robert Pattinson gives one of his most striking performances as Monte, the death-row criminal in outer space, tricked into making a voyage described at one stage as a “class-one suicide ride”. The former Twilight star makes his shaven-headed, gaunt-faced character seem hyper naturally sensitive and feral at the same time.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year. It’s a concert movie filmed over two nights and featuring Aretha Franklin, the “first lady of soul”, performing gospel standards in a church in Los Angeles in 1972, with a huge backing choir and an enthusiastic congregation.Disney’s live-action remake of its 1992 animated feature is a rip-roaring, old-fashioned matinee-style spectacle that turns out far better than we had any right to expect.“Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting – both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove – but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore, who has a firm understanding of the delicate balance between contentment and yearning, joy and pain, recklessness and spontaneity.

The worst reading since then was in June, an only slightly lower 43.1.“July data revealed declines in house building, commercial work and civil engineering, with all three areas suffering to some degree from domestic political uncertainty and delayed decision-making,” said Tim Moore at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.“If the current speed of construction sector retrenchment is sustained, it will soon ripple through the supply chain, and spillovers to other parts of the UK economy will quickly become apparent.”The measure of the sector’s optimism about the year ahead dropped to its lowest level since November 2012 as firms worried about Brexit, the prospect of a general election and delays to infrastructure work.In the nearer term, the outlook was also bleak as the number of new orders fell sharply, with firms blaming mainly a sluggish economy and political uncertainty.\u0026nbspHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed out this was the first time since 2016 that new orders had fallen for four successive months.\u0026nbsp“The weak July construction survey increases the concern that the UK economy has started the third quarter poorly, after GDP likely stagnated in the second quarter and could have contracted marginally,” he said.\u0026nbspThe PMI measure of the larger manufacturing sector, released on Thursday, was also weak, coming in at 48 –\u0026nbspthe same as in June and the lowest level in six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hunting, as they delivered a letter to Downing StreetThe European Union holds the largest voting block at Cites, and at previous votes has insisted African states all agree before backing any elephant-protection motions.“Europe, with its great influence on the global stage, has continued to back the trade in elephants at Cites, and each time they do, our elephant populations decline a little further,” the letter,\u0026nbspsigned by Moody\u0026nbspAwori, the former vice-president of Kenya,\u0026nbspAzizou\u0026nbspEl\u0026nbspHadj\u0026nbspIssa, a former agriculture minister of western African nation Benin, and\u0026nbspNomusa\u0026nbspDube, founder of the\u0026nbspZimbabwe\u0026nbspElephant Foundation,\u0026nbspstates.If passed, the motion will protect elephants in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe from the global ivory trade. The four countries want the ivory trade rules relaxed.\u0026nbspZambia, meanwhile, wants the status of its elephants downgraded to allow its ivory to be legally sold.Elephant extinction would ‘speed up climate crisis’“In most of Africa, elephants have never been treated as commodities for commercial gain,” the letter says. “This is an imported Western concept based on anthropocentric values.“Since this continent was first colonised, elephants have been reduced from being valued intrinsically to being instrumentally valued as mere commodities to be traded and killed for human gratification. In colonial days, the desire for ivory nearly wiped them out.“This is a construct that still weighs heavily on Africa today even though Africa is no longer physically shackled by colonialism.“There are still colonial ideological remnants when elephants are still regarded from an instrumental or market-valued perspective.”The letter says the mammals are still hunted or slaughtered, or babies are snatched from their mothers to be exported as trophies, ivory ornaments or live specimens.China still buys baby elephants from Zimbabwe for zoos, with claims their health suffers as a result.The writers add: “Contrary to the prevailing western views of wildlife management that elephants are\u0026nbspdestroying natural habitats, we Africans instead view their role as the great gardeners and\u0026nbsparchitects of our natural environment.”\u0026nbspThe EU says\u0026nbspit has launched numerous initiatives against international ivory trafficking, and is the main donor supporting African countries and law-enforcement agencies to fight the illegal trade.The European Commission says it has provided €2.25m\u0026nbsp(£2.06m) to help developing countries implement Cites, but declined when asked by The Independent\u0026nbspto respond to the claims of “colonialism” from those who signed the letter.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Books spill out from the pavement stalls onto the street, where browsers kneel to rifle through an eclectic offering.Gabriel Garcia Marquez sits alongside a book of American idioms. Thick engineering textbooks compete with countless biographies of George Bush and histories of the US invasion. But the street has a story as gripping as any of the books on sale.\u0026nbspReligious books used to dominate the market. Then for years under the rule of Saddam Hussein, the sellers were restricted in what they could offer. “I was jailed for selling ‘The Generals are the Last to Know,’” says one stall owner who goes by the name Haider ‘Magazine’.Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture.

It took years for it to recover.Today, the street is alive again, and the bestseller list is moving with the times.“The people who are buying are young people, honestly. They are currently looking for novels, or stories,” says Maher Muhammad, a bookshop owner on the street.“But this thing will not last. What do we say about that?

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist. But it was not him alone who deserves to take the rap.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is disappointing.He told the BBC the Lib Dems had scraped a win and the Tory candidate was very close to being elected.And he added in a plea to Brexiteers: If you vote for the Brexit Party, you will make it harder [to deliver Brexit].After topping the poll by , votes, winner Ms Dodds said: The people of this constituency have chosen hope over fear. We demand better.And encapsulating the threat to Brexit her victory poses, Ms Dodds added that her first act as an MP will be to demand a no-deal exit is ruled out.She said: People are desperately crying out for a dferent kind of politics.There is no time for tribalism when our country is faced with a Boris Johnson government and the threat of a no-deal Brexit.So my very first act as your MP when I arrive in Westminster will be to find Mr Boris Johnson wherever he is hiding and tell him loud and clear: Stop playing with the future of our communities and rule out a no-deal Brexit now.Lib Dem sources said this morning: Its a simple rule of politics -you stop listening, you lose touch and get punished.No doubt there is more of that to come.The by-election was called following the sacking of Mr Davies, , last month after more than , voters signed a recall petition.He had been convicted of submitting a  expenses claim - but was still chosen to fight to reclaim his seat by his local party.There were hopes that the Boris bounce in the polls could save the Tories from losing the Leave-voting mid-Wales constituency.But the defeat in Boris first election test - only  days after he took office, a record for a new PM - will be a headache for Number .The Tories now only have a majority of one - creating a fatal threat to PM Boris Brexit plan as it is steered through parliament.On his visit to Wales on Tuesday, Boris Johnson had warned: A vote for any party other than Conservatives pushes the Liberal Democrats one step closer to cancelling the referendum result.Now, just one MP deciding to abandon the party and join the Opposition could completely scupper efforts to deliver Brexit by October .Boris is also heavily reliant on the  votes of the Conservatives Northern Irish allies, the DUP, too.With the DUPs votes counted, the PM now has the support of  MPs - while opposition parties have .It was also a humiliating defeat for Labour - who narrowly avoided losing their deposit.Candidate Tom Davies limped behind in a dismal fourth place with just . per cent - beating only the Monster Raving Loony Party and UKIP.Support for Jeremy Corbyns party collapsed by . per cent - with Labour voters swarming to the Lib Dems and Brexit Party, who came third.But Jeremy Corbyn brushed it off on a visit to Scarborough this morning, saying it was obviously disappointing but theyd only won because Remainers teamed up.He added: The Liberal Democrats won it after doing a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Greens.I think that a lot of voters were determined to get rid of the Conservative, and they voted accordingly. So we were squeezed, but its a place we have not held for a very long time.

Britain during the stand-off between the West and the Soviet Union. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treatywas signed by US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in .It banned missiles with ranges between  and , miles.Mid-range nuclear weapons, which are banned under the treaty,  are very hard to detect and could reach European cities within minutes.This gives people little or no time to shelter and for air defences to down the missiles. But earlier this year the US and Nato accused Russia of violating the pact by deploying a new mid-range cruise missile, something which Moscow has denied.Back then Trump had set today as the deadline for the US to withdrawRussia didnt come into compliance.Speaking to the BBC about the collapse of the treaty, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: This is serious.The INF treaty has been a corner stone in arms control for decades.We have to be prepared for a world... with more Russian missiles.Later speaking at a press conference, Mr Stoltenburg vowed Nato would not deploy nuclear missiles in Europe.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also warned the INF was “an invaluable brake on nuclear war.He said: This will likely heighten, not reduce, the threat posed by ballistic missiles. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: Russias noncompliance under the treaty jeopardises US supreme interests as Russias development and fielding of a treaty-violating missile system represents a direct threat to the United States and our allies and partners.”Senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Russia had deployed multiple battalions of a Russian cruise missile throughout Russia in violation of the pact.This includes western Russia, with the ability to strike critical European targets.Russia denies the allegation.It says the missiles range puts it outside the treaty and has accused the United States of inventing a  pretext to exit a treaty which it claims Washington wants to leave anyway so it can develop new missiles. Russia has also rejected a US demand to destroy the new missile. The US is to test its own mid-range, land launched Tomahawk cruise missile later this month.The arms race began after the US exploded two nuclear bombs over Japan to end World War Two. But it really got under way when the Soviet Union exploded its first bomb in . Washington then stepped up its development of nukes, exploding a much more powerful “thermonuclear” weapon over the Pacic atoll of Eniwetak in . The Soviets exploded their own version in .By the s each side had enough nukes — and missiles to launch them — to create a sitation chillingly known as Mutually Assured Destruction .Should one side attack, the other would strike back and cause equal destruction. The prospect of this arguably acted as a deterrent throughout the Cold War. Still, the risk to the world was deemed too great. So in  the United States and the Soviet Union signed the first comprehensive nuclear arms reduction treaty.The most signicant agreement, which is widely thought to have ended the Cold War, was the  Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty .The treaty bans land-based missiles with a range between  and , miles..Essentially this ended the threat of a surprise attack as either side would have little warning. By , nearly , missiles had been scrapped.

behind the planes first turn.The aviation author described the infamous U-turn as extremely interesting.She said: The aircraft turned after it disappeared from secondary radar, the point at which the transponder was either turned off or failed.We only know what happened because it was tracked on military radar.As a part of the investigation into the flights doomed fate, the Malaysian government recreated the mystery turn.The simulations determined the point where the aircraft entered and exited the turn.Ms Wrigley says the simulations prove that the turn was at a steep bank anglewhile travelling at  knots.She adds that such a turn is simply not possible using the autopilot.The simulation results tell us one very important thing: the aircraft was under manual control.This was not a pre-programmed route and the autopilot was disengaged.It would not be easy to fly a controlled turn at that angle, which tells us that the person in control of the aircraft was experienced.Ms Wrigleys analysis backs up the claims that Malaysian captain and veteran pilot Zaharie Amad Shah was flying the aircraft when it disappeared.In the wake of the planes disappearance, rumours surfaced that he had locked the co-pilot out of the cockpit then crashed the plane in a murder-suicide.Ms Wrigley believes that after the initial sharp turn, the aircraft followed a set of waypoints.It is likely that on-board navigation systems were in use and so its impossible to knowsomeone was in the cockpit and how alert they were, she adds.However, she notes that the Malaysian investigation shows clearly that an experienced pilot was at the controls for the turn erting the aircraft back towards Malaysia.Ms Wrigley is the author of Without a Trace — a two-volume work covering aviation mysteries from  to the present day.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate. Five pieces, thought to be from the plane, recently washed up in Madagascar.Aviation expert Victor Iannello believes one fragment, which appears to be from the interior floorboard, is consistent with a “high-speed impact.More than  bits of aircraft debris have been collected from ious places around the world but only three wing fragments that washed up along the Indian Ocean have been confirmed to be from MH.In October , a sleuth claimed hed spotted an engine in the Cambodian jungle.Daniel Boyer previously claimed to have found the cockpit and tail, complete with Malaysia Airlines logo, of the missing aircraft.Some feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH.US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked.Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide.He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large le insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet.Malaysia Airlines found a -inch crack in the fuselage of one of its planes, days before MH disappeared.The Federal Aviation Administration insists it issued a final warning two days before the disappearance.But the Daily Mirror claimed the missing jet did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing s so it did not receive the warning.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unexpectedly said it was “very likely that the captain planned this shocking event”.He claimed the pilot wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery.Another theory claimed that he hijacked his own plane in protest of the jailing of then-Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and as a way to destabilise the corrupt government of Najib Razak.Another seemingly far-fetched idea said the pilot had deliberately crashed the plane to cover his track as he had parachuted out of the plane so he could spend the rest of his le with his girlfriend who was waiting in a boat in the sea.In the wake of the incident, South Korea noted that North Korea nearly took out a Chinese plane which had  passengers on board, on March , .Some fear Pyongyang shot the plane down, but others believe it was hijacked and erted into the communist nation.One theory claims that because many relatives were able to hear a ringing tone for up to four days after the crash so the doomed jet could not have smashed into the Indian Ocean.Nineteen families have all claimed the devices of their loved ones rang for up to four days after the jet went missing.However, wireless analysts claim that phone firms sometimes use a phantom ringing sound when the device is not active, the Daily Star reports.In September , British video producer Ian Wilson claimed to have found the missing aircraft using Google Maps.Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March .An MH sleuth has claimed that locals in Cambodia told him they saw a plane believed to be the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight crashing in the jungle.If the jet was flying north then possible locations could stretch as fast as the border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to Thailand.The Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak originally asked the Kazakhstan leader Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a search operation in the country but this quickly got sidelined as the rescue efforts focused on the Indian Ocean."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle first book kids dogs","story":"MEGHAN is writing her first book and plans to become a published author.The Sun can reveal the likely

He also made her a Thanpuying, a royal title meaning Lady during the lavish ceremony.However, the kings pristine ceremonial outfit was a far cry from the outrageous croptop and low-slung jeans he was once spotted wearing while wandering around a German shopping centre.The monarch even threatened to sue Facebook over the startling shots, taken in  by a passer-by who recognised the king.The images, which appeared to show Maha out for a stroll with a girlfriend while wearing fake tattoo “sleeves”, fall foul of Thailand’s extremely strict law of “lese-majeste” — or insulting royalty.But the king’s bizarre dress sense is just the tip of the iceberg for this clearly very dferent monarch.Indeed, his string of failed marriages and apparently insatiable appetite for women - his own mother Queen Sirikit branded him a womaniser - has had Thais quietly gossiping for years.During a  trip to the US, Sirikit said: “My son, the Crown Prince, is a little bit of a Don Juan.He is a good student, a good boy, but women find him interesting and he finds women even more interesting.”Maha has ruled Thailand since the death last year of his father who was married to Sirikit for  of those years.But in stark contrast to his father, Brit-educated Maha has already orced three times - and is now on his FOURTH we.In  he married his first we — his cousin, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara.They had a daughter, Bajrakitiyabha, but the relationship was doomed from the start.During the marriage Maha fathered four sons and a daughter with his mistress, actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth.They began living together but his we refused to orce him.Finally, in , he sued for orce, laying the blame for the failed relationship entirely at Soamsawali’s feet.He married Yuvadhida the following year but after a mysterious bust-up two years later, she fled to the UK to escape her husband.Livid Maha ordered posters to be placed all around his palace accusing her of adultery with a -year-old Thai air marshal.The prince then had his daughter brought back to Thailand. His four sons say they were banned from ing by their father.In a letter written in  they said: “We were ordered by our father not tohome to Thailand.

Moving out of insecure and often squalid properties into somewhere safe, clean, with spacious rooms and a garden, hot running water and inside bathrooms was a palatial upgrade. For people unable to buy a house it gave pride, dignity, independence and hope. But mostly a home in the heart of a community and the possibility of ­security for le. A century ago this week, a Liberal government passed The Addison Act, forcing every local authority to build council housing. It was part of David Lloyd George’s Homes Fit For Heroes campaign sparked by concerns over the shocking physical condition of many First World War army recruits. But actually it was  years earlier, in , that the first council houses in Europe were built, tenement blocks called St Martin’s Cottages in the ­Scotland Road area of Liverpool. As in  necessity was the mother of invention, when appalled health officials looked at the inhumane living conditions of a working-class dockside population which had exploded due to the booming port and large-scale Irish immigration and realised they must act.    The  flats and maisonettes, which cost s d a week to rent, were refurbished many times before demolition in . All that remains is a commemorative plaque outside a social club opposite where St Martin’s stood. Marie Maloney, , who lived in the tenements as a small child in the early s, before her large family moved out to Croxteth, has typically fond memories: “It was a very special place to the people who lived there. Everyone looked after each other. If we were ever short of money there was always someone to give you a shilling for the gas.” The community became the extended family’s spiritual home, so much that her elder brothers would often walk the six miles back to Scotland Road to where they felt comfortable. The golden age of council house-building came after the Second World War, when Clement Attlee’s Labour government built more than ,, largely to replace those flattened by Hitler’s Luftwaffe.    They were a new generation of council houses, built to more generous specications, with subsidies given to keep down rents. It meant decent, affordable housing was finally available to most low-income families. And today it raises a question: If a nation virtually bankrupted by war could do that while at the same time nationalising key industries, creating a welfare state and building a National Health Service, how come, today, the world’s fth richest country offers no solutions to a similar housing crisis  The UK currently has more than a million people on housing waiting lists, with , children in temporary shelter. The state of some of that temporary housing is heartbreaking: squalid, insect-infested BBs and container-like shells which resemble prison cells.    Rough sleeping has doubled since , home-ownership has fallen to a -year low with the average house costing eight times the average annual salary, and almost double that in London. Housing charity Shelter estimates there is a social housing deficit of . million homes. Meanwhile luxury flats stand empty and millions are paying exorbitant rent to private landlords. Yet the obvious solution we came up with in  is nowhere to be seen. In  there were . million council houses, today it is two million and shrinking. In the s we were building , a year,  times more than the , we build today.    George Clarke, an architect presenting a Channel  series to commemorate the centenary of the Addison Act, wants the Government to build , new council homes a year and suspend Right To Buy, because “everyone should have the option of a decent quality home to rent. If people are in stable homes with affordable rents then everything has a chance of falling into place.” His point being thatyou don’t give the poorest families the chance to achieve dignity you end up with acute homelessness, crime, social and mental health issues. The problem is that ever since Margaret Thatcher came to power, council house ownership has been a dirty notion.    She saw the state as the enemy so gave every tenant who had lived in their council house for three years the right to buy it.More than two million did but a fraction of the money went to councils who were barred from spending all but a small amount of it on new housing stock. Worse,  per cent of the council houses that were bought were sold on to private landlords. Hence a ticking time-bomb ignored by Governments including Tony Blair ’s Labour, who didn’t want to appear “unaspirational” by building council houses.Nick Clegg recalls raising the issue with the Lib Dem coalition cabinet, and being told by a prominent Tory: “I don’t understand why you keep going on about more social housing – it just creates Labour voters.”    Since the Great Thatcher Sell-off a stigma has been attached to council housing which has held back progressive thinking. Many on the right demonise estates as a collection of Benefits Streets occupied by the undeserving poor. Which suits their agenda of dismantling the state and delivering all assets into private hands. It’s why today we have effectively privatised housing the way we did water, gas and railways. The truth is that not everyone can afford to buy a house but everyone needs a home. And it is possible toto that Attlee ideal of building council houses better than ever.  Labour realises this, and has pledged to build, over  years, a million affordable homes to rent and buy, including the biggest council house-building programme for almost four decades. It will also stop the sell-off of , social rented homes a year by suspending the Right To Buy.If we can find billions for a no-deal Brexit that probably won’t happen, why can’t we find it to fix a housing crisis that is very much happening If the Old Etonians who run the country truly believe an Englishman’s home is his castle why are they happy to let so many stare forlornly at a pulled-up drawbridge  "},{"url":null,"title":"environment secretary backs ban sick","story":"NewsEnvironment Secretary backs ban on sick trophy hunters importing dead animals to UKEXCLUSIVE: New Environment Secretary backs the Mirrors campaign to stop people shipping home animals theyve shot for pleasure.ShareCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics:,  AUG NewsThe Mirror wants a ban on the import of all trophy hunting spoils to the UK\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new Environment Secretary is backing our drive to ban trophy hunting.

The -year-oldaposs body has not been found after she plunged up to ,ft into the savanna on the Indian Ocean island, where she was researching the endangered blue crab. Ms Cutlandaposs uncle said she had became sick during her time in Madagascar, possibly due to prescription medication, although reports have claimed police are investigating her possible use of an anti-malaria drug. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror    She had taken ill after being there for a few days and when she spoke to her mother on the phone two days before the accident she was mumbling and sounded pretty incoherent, Lester Riley, the brother of Ms Cutlandaposs mother Alison, told MailOnline. We think she had suffered a severe reaction to some drugs but not anti-malaria ones because she had taken those on her trip last year to China without any side effects. It was reported Ms Cutland suffered paranoia attacks during her trip. A friend claimed Ms Cutland had sounded upset in her final call to her mum Alison, telling her in broken speech moments before take-off: Me, plane, home.    A source claimed to the Sun: Alana was taking a type of malaria drug and police are working on a theory that is what was sending her delirious. Her last phone call to her mum wasnapost like her at all. It didnapost make sense. She wasnapost in the right frame of mind and it was unlike any normal conversation she would have had. The Biological Natural Sciences student, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was due to spend six weeks in Madagascar, where she was carrying out research in the remote area of Anjajavy. She was on her way back to the UK on July  after she had reluctantly agreed to cut short the trip at her parentsapos request, it was reported.  Mr Riley said his niece was being taken to a hospital so she could be treated and declared fit to fly home. According to police, she unbuckled her seatbelt just minutes after take-off and opened one of the small Cessnaaposs two doors. She threw threw herself out after fighting off the pilot and fellow British passenger Ruth Johnson, who had grabbed onto her and lost their grip after becoming exhausted during the struggle, say police. Mr Riley said his niece never suffered from mental illness, adding: What happened, the family believe, was a tragic accident not a suicide and we are utterly heartbroken. He said she had been hallucinating and she must have had a reaction to medication.  The planeaposs pilot said Ms Cutland had a headache when she boarded and stayed silent during the flight. But for the whole time Alana did not say a word - she just struggled to get away from us, Mahefa Tahina Rantoanina told the Sun. I have no idea why she opened the door but she did. She opened the door and she jumped. The door did not open itself. Police photographs recreating Ms Cutlandaposs final moments appear to show the pilot and the second passenger grasping hold of the victimaposs leg as she hangs out of the plane. The force said Ms Cutland took off her seatbelt about  minutes into the flight, unlocked the right door and tried to get out.  That led to a desperate five-minute struggle in which the pilot and Ms Johnson tried to keep the teen on board. Mr Riley said his niece met Ms Johnson during the trip. Police believe Ms Cutland landed in an area populated by carnivorous fossas, cat-like mammals endemic to Madagascar.

Michael Joyce, , groomed and bullied his two victims into constructing a fully-working bar. The pub - called aposThe Dons Barapos - boasts a fireplace, pool table, television, cushioned benches, dartboard, jukebox, a cigarette machine - and a fully-equipped bar. Outside the pub, timber steps led up to a decked veranda, decorated with lights and hanging baskets, and two statues flanking blue double doors. Pictures from inside the decorated boozer show Joyceaposs friends enjoying drinks, parties - and playing poker.    The pub, on a travelleraposs site, took the vulnerable victims around eleven weeks to complete.Joyce forced them to work for nothing to build a pub where he and other travellers could celebrate birthdays, Halloween , and Christmas.The Dons Bar, at Redbridge Hollow in Oxford, Oxon., was frequented by travellers of all ages and Joyce said he was pleased with the final result. But a trial at Oxford Crown Court heard that the victims, who both struggled with heroin addiction, were petried of Joyce, who made their lives hell. The court heard how both victims, who called Joyce bossman, were only ever paid in cannabis or cigarettes. One claimed in his evidence that implicit threats were made against him, his partner, and his father. And the court heard that the victim ended up paying a whopping £, in small sums to Joyce over a number of years. Joyce denied five counts of modern slavery charges relating to the forced labour and exploitation of the two men between April , , and January , .    But a jury ed a guilty verdict after hearing how Joyce took advantage of his two victims. Giving evidence about his ordeal, one of the men said he used to cry myself to sleep during his time with the Joyce family. He said: My le with the Joyces was hell. I used to cry myself to sleep. My le was not in a good place. It was just a constant battle with every aspect of my day-to-day le. By the summer of , one victim described how he was being forced to work at the travellersapos site to pay off an endless debt after Joyce loaned him £, the court heard. He told how Joyce, whom he referred to as Mick, bossman, or big man, was constantly demanding money from him, and made him keep a diary from April  to document his debts. On a fortnightly basis Joyce would call him on the day he received his benefits to ask for payments, driving him to a cash pointhe didnapost have the money. When asked why he did not challenge Joyce, the victim said he had struggled with a heroin habit at the time, laughed and said: You donapost say no to Michael Joyce. The court heard how, at one stage, there was a diary note for the aposlast payment for Michael,apos - yet more entries followed. He said, aposYouaposre having a f***ing laugh, you owe me thousands boyapos, the victim added. You wouldnapost ask that of Michael because of the fear of getting smacked. Without a doubt, I wouldnapost have even questioned what he said - to this day, I am petried of him. And the second victim agreed that he would get a bo****kinghe disobeyed Joyce, and that it was aposfearapos that kept him going back. He said that on two occasions Joyce gave him a slap - once when he ignored his calls, and the other when he answered back. Both men told the court that Joyce would pay them either £ for a dayaposs work, or buy them a small bag of tobacco. The first said he would never take it for granted that he would be paid, and that there would be plenty of days where he got nothing for labouring from .am to pm. In the case of the other victim, he said that he would travel three miles to every morning to score heroin, and that Joyce would pay for his fix. He said he would take the heroin when they got to the site, usually in the tool shed or in a van, which would stave off his withdrawal symptoms and keep him working. Joyce explicitly denied any wrong-doing throughout the trial.

The Rev Simon Sayers sent lurid texts to the woman, who was also married, as they “strayed appallingly” into an affair when she sought pastoral support. Sayers, , said in one message: “I’m home now but really enjoyed you sitting astride me sans panties.” In another he wrote: “You too are the most passionate, sexy, skilled and sensuous lover and my body is yours, my heart and soul are yours for ever.” He was already serving a suspension for sexual contact with a -year-old girl. Sayers confessed to “betraying his calling” in a letter to a private CofE hearing, where he was this week found guilty of inappropriate conduct. The tribunal heard he exchanged vows with his lover in an informal wedding service and gave her a ring. The woman – referred to only as “Mrs X” throughout the proceedings – believed the pair were in love. She transcribed all  of the texts they sent one another in her diary, the tribunal heard. In a letter to the , Sayers, who did not attend the hearing, admitted the three-month relationship and referenced “that terrible incident” with the schoolgirl years earlier.    “I can offer no excuse, only profound sorrow for betraying my we and calling once more,” he said. “During the autumn of , there was a shameful affair. We were both facing painful issues, and mutual comfort strayed appallingly into an affair.” Sayers, the former rector of Emsworth-with-Warblington, Hants, which has two churches, St James and St Thomas a Becket, was suspended for five years in  after an investigation into his conduct with the schoolgirl. Following a -month review, the Bishop of London – in whose diocese the incidents happened – slammed Sayers for abusing his “position of trust”. In a statement after he was suspended, Sayers described his first encounter with the -year-old in  as a “brief above- the-waist incident”. He also admitted kissing her in a second encounter. The politan Police investigated the allegations, but no criminal charges were brought. Canon Ruth Arlow, who chaired the  hearing the latest case, slammed Sayers’ “serious betrayal” of his we. And a spokeswoman for the Diocese of Portsmouth, where he was based, confirmed Sayers would never work as a clergyman again. She said: “The Rev Simon Sayers had already been prohibited from ministry for five years after accepting a penalty for previous misconduct. “The tribunal has now imposed a penalty of prohibition from ministry for le. The penalty reflects the seriousness of this misconduct. The Church of England takes all allegations of ­misconduct seriously.” Ms Arlow added that several aggravating factors prompted the le ban, including the fact the pair exchanged vows “based on the marriage service and the giving of a ring”.  She said: “It is signicant this is not the first time the respondent has committed serious sexual misconduct. “On both occasions, it has taken place with someone within his pastoral care. “His express rejection that there was any abuse of power in the situation indicates a failure to appreciate the position of trust in which priests are placed. But one former parishioner insisted Sayers was “a good man” and should not have been axed. Brendan Gibb-Gray, a retired Scotland Yard detective chief superintendent, said: “I feel immensely sorry for him. “The church should be forgiving him. “If no one was hurt, while this incident is contrary to Christian teaching, I feel there should have been another chance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles sister saving presents","story":"NewsMeghan Markles sister saving presents for Archie when he escapes her clutchesThe Duchess of Sussexs estranged sister Samantha Markle has taken aim at Meghan in a cruel outburst days before she will celebrate her birthday with Prince Harry and son ArchieShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsSamantha Markle still wants to meet nephew, Archie \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markleaposs sister says she is saving presents for nephew Archie aposwhen heaposs old enough to escape his controlling motheraposs clutchesapos.Samantha Markle, , who is estranged from Meghan, , has once again taken aim at the former actress with another toxic torrent of abuse - despite holding out hope of reconciliation.

Almost half of those polled reckon they work longer hours now than they did  or  years ago, with four in  more likely to work from home without being paid. One quarter even said their boss has told them they are expected to work above their contract hours without for free - with  per cent claiming management is altogether more demanding these days. Six in  adults attribute the harder working conditions to the rise in technology, claiming there is never any escape now as clients, customers and colleagues can contact them  . And four in  office workers say their work-le balance is worse than it was in previous decades. Animal charity SPANA carried out the research to raise awareness of working animals worldwide, which face a letime of work, with no retirement, in appalling conditions that never change. Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive of animal charity SPANA, which provides free veterinary treatment to working animals in developing countries, said: They say things were aposbetter in my dayapos.Itaposs clear that older workers are nostalgic about the past and a time when work felt less stressful. But while it can be dficult to get to grips with longer working hours, new technology and higher demands, these problems pale in comparison with the gruelling conditions endured by working animals overseas. The study also revealed one-hour lunch breaks, working nine to five and a simple tea round are among the things office workers miss about the past. Being able to leave work on time without feeling guilty, wearing a suit or set unorm and shutting emails down at the end of the day, also feature in the list.    Others miss getting paid to work overtime and the idea of a aposjob for leapos. There are also some office items workers miss from aposback in the dayapos - including fax machines, typewriters, and even Tippex. Workers also miss being able to go to the pub at lunchtime with colleagues and the days when they were allowed to have a -minute break in the morning and the afternoon. Others fondly remember a time when they were rewarded with extra holiday for every year of service, and had final salary pension schemes. Dragonaposs Den investor Deborah Meaden said: Workplaces in Britain have changed beyond recognition in the past few decades - and conditions for workers have generally improved enormously. But for most working animals overseas nothing ever changes. They face the same punishing conditions day-in, day-out, working in extreme temperatures and carrying backbreaking loads.  Please support SPANAaposs work to ensure these hardworking horses, donkeys, elephants and camels receive the vital veterinary treatment they need and that their welfare is improved. Geoffrey Dennis added: Change in the workplace is rapid and itaposs unlikely to slow down any time soon. However, although some people in the UK may not regard changes at work positively, itaposs important to spare a thought for working animals in developing countries around the world, which continue to work in harsh environments and suffer short, painful lives.

This amounts to almost three full hours a week,  days of each year or more than eight months before the kids reach adulthood. Almost two thirds even went as far as to say that parenting is just aposa constant roundapos of mediation with their offspring. The research, commissioned by childrenaposs vitamins firm Wellkid, found one in three negotiate with their kids by threatening to take away something precious, such as their favourite toy, while  per cent threaten a TV or screen ban. Others remove the choice of sweets or dessert, confiscate their computer, games console and gadgets.    Holding back a chunk of pocket money is also an option for many while one in five offer to let their children stay up laterthey carry out a task.

Mums are most likely to lay down the law when getting children to do their homework, eat everything on their plate or try new foods. But dads are the strictest parents when it comes to dealing with their childrenaposs behaviour and discipline. A spokesperson for Wellkid, from Vitabiotics, said: Unfortunately, itaposs not always as simple as just asking children to do something, and then they do it. Parents have to resort to all kinds of negotiations to persuade their children to behave in a certain way or eat the food which is put in front of them.    Itaposs just about finding something that works for you and your child. But it seems mums are mostly to be the tougher parent when negotiating, with the results showing they are most likely to be the ones getting their children to do everything they should be doing, whether thataposs their homework, eating a balanced diet or simply not spending all day glued to a screen.  But while dads may be adopting a more laid-back approach to these aspects of parenting, they are still the ones keeping an eye on bad behaviour.

Britain was now in a recession an and such frivolous displays of wealth were unpalatable to the Queen. She is one of the hardest-working royals, despite her age, and that a future member of the family was without a full-time job was unacceptable to her. While the rest of the world speculated that an engagement was on the horizon for William and Kate, the Queen believed an announcement should be postponed until Kate was settled in a career.    In the book, Nicholl quotes a source who says: It is Her Majesty’s opinion thatKate is one day going to be William’s consort, then she needs a proper job. Swanning from one five-star holiday resort to another is not the prerequisite for a young woman possibly destined to be Queen. Nicholl claims Kate was stung by the Queenaposs words.

At the request of Alanaaposs parents, Ms Johnson was accompanying her home when the tragedy unfolded on July , just five minutes into the two hour and  minute flight. It is understood Alana unbuckled her seatbelt, leaned forward and turned the door handle prompting the pilot to desperately try and close it. Ms Johnson then tried to stop Alana from falling out, but was battling the wind and rocking of the plane.Pilot Mahefa Tahina Rantoanina, , said the teenager stayed “completely silent during the horrying incident. He told The Sun: “I had just taken off and I was still climbing when all of a sudden there was a rush of wind and Ruth started screaming. I turned round and saw Alana hanging out of my plane.   “I immediately levelled the aircraft to try and keep us on course, then I reached over and held the door. “I was trying to pull it shut while Ruth was holding on to Alana’s leg. I was trying to fly and stop her from falling at the same time. I was absolutely terried, we all were. Extensive searches to try and locate Alana in an area which includes a lake, dense forest, woodland and swamps have so far proved fruitless.As we previously reported, Alana was mumbling and incoherent in the days before her death, according to her uncle, Lester Riley.    He said she had became sick during her time in Madagascar, possibly due to prescription medication, although reports have claimed police are investigating her possible use of an anti-malaria drug.He told MailOnline: She had taken ill after being there for a few days and when she spoke to her mother on the phone two days before the accident she was mumbling and sounded pretty incoherent. We think she had suffered a severe reaction to some drugs but not anti-malaria ones because she had taken those on her trip last year to China without any side effects. One of Alanaaposs friends also claims the Brit sounded upset in a final phone call to her mum and said: Me, plane, home.A source claimed to the Sun: Alana was taking a type of malaria drug and police are working on a theory that is what was sending her delirious.Her last phone call to her mum wasnapost like her at all. It didnapost make sense. She wasnapost in the right frame of mind and it was unlike any normal conversation she would have had.

Typically I’d cover Donald Trump’s rallies from either behind the penned barricades or from the safety of a live feed off a TV news channel. But this time it was dferent. For, after braving five hours waiting to board the Trump Train at the President’s latest  re-election rally, I joined thousands of his supporters in Cincinnati’s C heat to become just another face in the crowd. Like the President, I was more interested in how his base responded, and to what, opting this time to just listen to what they were saying to each other, and to Trump, instead of fact-checking his every word.  The President wasn’t scheduled to take to the stage until pm but by .pm, after being patted down by the Secret Service, I’d taken my seat stage right. Sitting alongside the Deplorables, as Hillary Clinton labelled Trump’s supporters, I was told by farmer and uber Trump fan Nick Pepper to expect “fireworks”. “This will be like nothing you’ve ever seen before,” the three-time rally veteran told me. “He’s our leader and we believe in what he says. “If President Trump says we need a wall, we need a wall. “If he says send those who don’t like our country home, send them home. “He delivers on his promises.” As , filled the US Bank Arena, the die-hard crowd were played like a symphony orchestra as Team Trump whipped supporters into a frenzy as they waited for their messiah. One-by-one, local politicians and judges – yes, they are political here – took to the stage to tell why the President should be re-elected on November  next year, only then for the real warm-up act to enter. Grinning inanely like a constipated Cheshire Cat, Don Trump Jr, swaggered his way to the podium. Having torn himself away from the killing fields and put down his big-game hunting rles, the President’s eldest child picked up his political pistols to fire off volley after volley of attacks on his father’s critics. Whether it be Trump’s political opponents, cities which his dad had attacked, immigration or mocking Joe Biden, nothing was off-limits. Then, after what seemed like the entire Rolling Stones back catalogue, Survivor’s Eye of the Tiger kicked in and the crowd knew the king of bungle was due on stage. He swaggered on like a power-hungry Roman emperor, giving the same thumbs-up Caesar gave in his adoring amphitheatres. As he paced the walkway and smiled and waved, the crowd leapt to its feet and roared, waving campaign-provided signs reading, “Jobs Jobs Jobs” and “Women for Trump”. But it didn’t take long before the President was throwing political red meat to the baying crowd who applauded his every sentence, boast and lie. They reached their thunderous loudest quickly, however, when several protesters showed their hand. In unison, like a military-run pack of hyenas, the crowd turned on them as they held up posters reading, “Immigrants Built America”. The protesters’ cries that Trump was a racist were drowned by chants of “USA, USA,” and “Trump, Trump, Trump,” before the President told “law enforcement” to move in. Quickly, the US leader got back on message. He mocked rival Democrats for attacking former President Barack Obama during a debate this week and got in hits at rivals Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren during his remarks. But it was the behaviour of the crowd that I and the world were watching, following last month’s rally in North Carolina. There, Trump had continued his racist broadside at a foursome of Democratic congresswomen of colour known as The Squad, telling them to “go back” to the countries they came from – even though three of them were born in the States. Trump supporters at that rally increased the attack with chants of “send her back”. This time, Cincinnati’s crowd offered their fair share of boos, cheers of “USA”, “build the wall,” and even ed to the  campaign chant regarding Hillary Clinton, screaming “lock her up”. But they didn’t go as far as the Carolina supporters, as Trump told the arena: “We want no controversy”. He did, however, blame “the far-left’s destructive agenda” for poverty and crime in inner cities, increasing his effort to tie Democrats to poor neighbourhoods. Trump accused his rivals of prioritising undocumented immigrants over American citizens, called Calornia “a disgrace to our country” and sought to talk up his efforts to improve minority communities. “For decades, these communities have been run exclusively byDemocrat politicians and it’s been total one-party control of the inner cities,” he said. “For  years it’s been one-party control and look at them. We can name one after another but I won’t do that because I don’t want to be controversial.” Trump’s remarks were a clear reference to his recent attacks on Elijah Cummings, the black Democratic lawmaker whose Baltimore district Trump described as “rat and rodent-infested” and a place where “no human being would want to live”.  Trump belittled the Maryland city, a majority-black borough, claiming its murder rate is higher than war-torn Afghanistan. Tellingly, the vast majority in the arena were white – I counted no more than  African Americans. For an hour and  minutes, Trump rambled along, at times incoherently ignoring the autocue, but he knows how to sell himself to his crowd.  His repealing of the Iran nuclear deal, his scuttling of the Paris accords and the moving of the US embassy to Jerusalem, he insisted, had “restored American pride”. “Keep America great again,” he boomed, as he closed his show. The salesman in Trump had sold Cincinnati precisely what they wanted to hear.

However not everyone was in disagreement with him, a few people were shocked by the backlash and supported his comments. People sure do get p***ed off about some friendly advice, remarked one user.

If these bacteria are disturbed it can lead to infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or thrush, and inflammation. Steaming the vagina could affect this healthy balance of bacteria and pH levels and cause irritation, infection and inflammation. It could also burn the delicate skin around the vagina. Similarly, Dr Naomi Crouch of the RCOG pointed out that there was no proven evidence to suggest that techniques such as the O-Shot improve chances of sexual satisfacition. She added: If a woman is unable to have an orgasm, she should see her GP or go to a genitourinary medicineclinic.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"districts","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPreserving historic KilbrideA GoFundMe donation page is making the rounds after community group Friends of Kilbride made a plea for funds to preserve historic Kilbride.Kilbride, located three miles south of Oban, includes the ruins of a th-century church, Clan MacDougall’s memorial aisle and an extensive graveyard dating back many centuries.

Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing.

A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall.

Some older cars rely on  ron petrol and with the replacement of the pumps in the Esso garage, drivers will be forced to drive almost  miles to Dunbeg, by Oban, or  miles to Helensburgh.Lochgilphead resident Lockhart Leitch raised the issue with MSP Michael Russell who contacted Esso for a response.A spokesperson for Esso said: #We recently replaced the pumps at the Tesco Esso Lochgilphead service station, removing supreme unleaded and replacing it with supreme diesel in addition to the regular unleaded and diesel products.#Sales of regular diesel make up two thirds of all fuel sales at this site, therefore having this additional diesel grade provides an alternative option for a bigger proportion of our customerswe experience dficulties with replenishing regular diesel stocks when the weather challenges us to reach Lochgilphead.#Although it would be a long drive, we can offer a supreme unleaded grade at Helensburgh Express as well as a site near Oban.#We continually review the fuel offerings at all our sites but at the current time we have no plans to reinstate supreme unleaded at Lochgilphead. We did advise the community with two weeks notice of our plans to close the forecourt during the works, however, I note we could have done better in providing advance notice of the grade change specically and we will endeavour to provide notices on site in advance of any future changes.#MSP Michael Russell said: #I would be concernedthere was a reduction in choice in any of the garages. If people need  ron they should be able to get it locally, particularly where there is more than one petrol station.#Narrowing the choice and making people drive to buy petrol is never a good idea.#In response, Lockhart Leitch said: #The reply from Esso is, to my mind, a typical big company response. They are entitled to change productsthey are not selling as they would like, however, to change from Supreme petrol to Supreme diesel without at least notying customers in advance that Supreme

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre.

I#ve been on many a demonstration in my time and this was one of the best.Rolling off the ferry on the Friday evening we were welcomed by a guard-of-honour standing along the pier waving saltires.The townsfolk turned out in droves to welcome us, waving saltires from windows and even stringing saltire bunting across the street at fourth-storey level. I had the romantic impression that the good folk of Campbeltown had been following the ious pro-independence rallies as they worked their way around the geography of Scotland and had just been waiting for their own town#s turn!The sun stayed out for us right until pm. Then the rain suddenly came down and we took down our Pensioners for Independence stall.  That evening Yes Kintyre put on a special party for us all with local musicians in the Argyll Arms Hotel.On Sunday some of us stayed on and explored your beautul peninsula. As the ferry pulled away that evening members of Yes Kintyre stood along the harbour wall holding up saltires to bid us farewell.Thank you all again for a memorable experience.Yours,Mary McCabe,Glasgow.Sir,It was my great privilege to attend yet another Open at Royal Portrush and to witness  year-old Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre finish tied sixth in his very first Major Championship.It was a wonderful performance, and confirmation, of the talent and the temperament we, the journalists, felt sure that he had.  He is now a Euro millionaire, but he remains an open, helpful and cheerful lad with both feet firmly planted on the ground, thanks to a great family and a strong desire to remain in his home town.I was at Glencruitten for the first time in June and soon discovered why Robert wants to go back there on a regular basis after weeks on tour.  It#s a terric club, no airs and graces.  They are very proud of Robert, and rightly so, but I very much doubtthey would allow him to lose his down-to-earth approach to international recognition.Yours,Jock MacVicar, Southend-born Scottishgolf correspondent and long-time Dunaverty member. Sir,Through the columns of your newspaper, may I express my grateful thanks to all the businesses, organisations, and iniduals, who donated to our fundraising, allowing the dancers to compete in the United States Highland Dancing Championships held recently in Las Vegas.We had a very successful trip, placing in both the Highland and choreography events.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

And would you recommend it to your friends back home  The answer to this one, however, was an emphatic ldquonon.Why  The trains, of course. Rickety, overcrowded, overbooked carriages, lack of luggage space, uncomfortable seats, catering that comprised of crisps and instant coffee, inadequate windows, overgrown trees making visibility dficult, service cancellations their list of complaints was extensive. The rolling stock, they said incredulously, was little better than that used on the local network in Glasgow, despite the journey from Mallaig to Glasgow taking five and a half hours.My heart sank. Irsquod tried to warn them that the trains would not be up to European standards, but they were aghast at the reality. ldquoWhat a terrible waste of incredible landscape, they kept saying. I was ashamed but couldnrsquot argue with a word of what they said. Irsquove taken the West Highland Line three times in the last five years and had passenger experiences that range from not as bad as Irsquod feared, to bloody awful. The staff who work on the trains are pleasant and stoic, but the trains themselves are an embarrassing disgrace.Greatest railway journey on earth  Hardly. That the landscape is breath-taking and spectacular isnrsquot in question. Glimpsing white sandy beaches and shimmering sea through the mountains on the approach to Mallaig is one of lersquos great experiences. But when yoursquore assured a more comfortable ride with better visibility and catering on the local rail network in Munich, something is fundamentally amiss.Read more: Row over -day closure of West Highland LineTo think that Scotland is letting its visitors down in this way, not to mention the communities that would see such economic benefit from a well-served West Highland Line, is frustrating and depressing in equal measure, especially since rail tourism, with its cleaner environmental footprint, is surely the future.Not that the state of trains is putting tourists off. Indeed, the global trumpeting of Scotland means passenger numbers are rising on all branches of the line Glenfinnan station saw a  per cent increase last year. Tourism has never been more valuable to the Scottish economy, bringing in upwards of poundbn a year, with visitors from Europe and the US flocking here off the back of a cheap pound and TV shows such as Outlander.But the more visitors that come, the more ill-equipped ScotRail will be to give them a pleasant journey on the West Highland Line. Improvements have been promised many times over the years but come to nothing. A few extra services have been put on in summer, and some new carriages with better luggage space are apparently in the offing. But better trains with improved seating and windows, and locally-sourced catering, are still nowhere to be seen, despite being mooted after Abellio was given the rail franchise in October .To be fair, ScotRail can only work within the financial confines of its contract. And a painfully slow-moving Transport Scotland review of the line is charged only with exploring improvements within current levels of investment. Itrsquos also worth pointing out that the line is old and remote, which limits the type of trains that could be run, and the Highlands has long been at the back of the queue when it comes to rail upgrades.Whatrsquos needed now, then, is a far more ambitious improvement plan for the West Highland Line, one that includes infrastructure boosts for the communities along the way as well as fully-staffed, modern trains with viewing carriages, comfortable seating and a high-quality catering offering serving tasty local produce. In other words, the sort of trains that are the norm on scenic journeys in Germany, Switzerland and France. How did they get such trains  By making public transport and tourism a political priority.If the political will existed in Scotland to raise the funds and bring stakeholders together, the West Coast Line could have the best trains in Europe. Are you listening, SNP Government  You canrsquot just blame ScotRail and Westminster-all need to work together forchange.Boris Johnson makes his first Prime Ministerial visit to Scotland today, fresh from backing a high-speed rail link between Leeds and Manchester. He could do worse than trying to win over his many detractors here by promising the Scottish Government the sort of funding that could transform our rail infrastructure. And first in the queue for investment should be the West Highland Line. Without it, this jewel in the crown of Scottish tourism can never be a truly great railway journey."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Judge society by how happy we are  not how wealthy","story":"The merest glimpse of the lives of moguls, oligarchs and millionaires tells you that. Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive. Slowing the Gradgrind pursuit of ever-greater productivity, focusing on more nourishing and longer-lasting priorities, is a way of calling time on the fallacy that the bottom line is all that matters, and that cash is king. It is a way of taking an ethical stance, and saying enough is enough. How to calculate what constitutes enough, of course ndash be it income, savings, love, leisure, charity, you name it ndash is even harder than measuring happiness.Read more: Scotlands history has lain in the British shadow for too long"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10212492.jpg?type=article-full","title":"dont-miss-fantastic-hidden-gems-throughout-angus-fife","story":"BalbinnyLooking for somewhere luxurious to stay in the Angus countryside  - then look no further than the stunning Balbinny.Situated in rolling farmland between the market towns of Forfar and Brechin, Balbinny benefits from -degree views across the River South Esk towards the Angus Glens, and onto the Cairngorms.A development of luxury self-catering accommodation all with master bedrooms featuring super king sized beds, flat screen televisions and bi-folding glass doors, treat yourself to luxury in the heart of the countryside.Complemented by an award winning swimming pool, spa and fitness suite - make the most of your stay by indulging in one of their therapeutic treatments.Tempted  ndash Grab pound off  nights or more between    -    and quote lsquoHeraldrsquo.Tel Email info@balbinnywww.balbinnywww.balbinny news-and-offerswww.facebook balbinnyInstagram balbinny-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Burntisland Golf ClubDating back to , the original Burntisland Golf Club is officially recognised as the tenth oldest golf club in the world.

Dooley reckons she now has a ldquobalsamic vinegar and oat milk middle class palate.What the presenter is suggesting is that class can sht. But thatrsquos not what Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard has been saying. The private school educated politician has reconstituted Marxism in declaring that a doctor on poundk a year is working class, because he sells his labour to the NHS.But is middle classness defined by a work contract  If thatrsquos the case is Boris Johnson working class, given he sells his labour to the state, and to The Daily  Wersquove also had BBC Media Editor Amol Rajan declare his own working class credentials in hisdocumentary How To Break Into the Elite, even though hersquos Oxbridge and earns poundk-plus for asking questions such as lsquoWhat defines working classness rsquoRajan would claim we can still claim to be working class eventhe circumstances by which we were defined in the first place have altered  Hersquod argue that although I grew up in a council flat my current postcode of Glasgowrsquos G doesnrsquot reassign me as being a bit Phoebe Waller-Bridge.But is journalism a middle class occupation, given itrsquos populated by a range of income groups  And is lestyle an indicator   Being working class once meant keeping doos was almost compulsory yet Irsquove never raced whippets or thrown arrows but instead play tennis, which is regarded by friends as the slippery slope to cricket.I do go to the theatre, a lot, once regarded a middle-class pastime, but surely thatrsquos changed  Can anyone really argue a night at the Kingrsquos watching Kinky Boots confirms toffery  And I tried opera once, which would have confirmed that I truly had middle class urges, but I have to point out I left at the interval. Yes, Irsquove been on holiday to Tuscany, which suggest something very BBC about me. But I did travel sub-class, which is to say Ryanair.Are material goods an indicator  Well, my car is German, which automatically implies its owner to be middle class. But one colleague said buying such cars is a working class trope. In any case, my pal Big Alex has a bigger one and hersquos a painter and decorator. What about shopping  It sounds as though Stacey does Waitrose, but thatrsquos anathema to me.Or television viewing  I watch a lot of Newsnight, and Channel Four news, which is public school top heavy. But for some reason Irsquom not keen on Anthony Armstrong . Yet, Irsquom not that keen on Danny Dyer either. And where does Love Island fit the class viewing demographic  Bet it wasnrsquot only teenagers in council flats who were delighted to see the lovely Amber walk away with poundk tucked into the back pocket of her red ruffle shorts.Yes, I like to eat out, which is so middle class, but Irsquom not likely to order up an avocado latte with soy milk and granola sprinklings anytime soon. Education  I did go to a grammar school and my best palrsquos dad owned a pub, who bought him an Opel Ascona for his th, but I could barely afford a packet of Opal Fruits at the time.I havenrsquot too many middle-class friends, but I did once have a girlfriend who was at a Swiss finishing school where she dated Roger Moorersquos son, Geoffrey Irsquove been told I sound working class however. A colleague with a private school accent whom I wonrsquot namemaintained that as soon as one opens onersquos mouth onersquos class credentials spill out like Iceland canned soup.

We know instinctively wersquore not growing to break into a grouping that is formed by wealthy parents who pay poundk a year to send their children to Eton, Charterhouse and the top jobs. Thatrsquos why  per cent of top judges are private school educated, as are  per cent of the Cabinet. Yet, only seven per cent of the nationrsquos kids go to private school.So Irsquom guessing Irsquom not really a crossover like Stacey.

We will have to double it again within five yearswe are to meet our climate change action plan commitments.ldquoAnd the Committee on Climate Change has called for the amount of tree planting to increase even further.:Scotlands industrial wastelands to be turned into forestsHowever, he pointed out that it is not simply a case of planting more trees. ldquoGrowing trees is actually a tricky business, especially in the early stages. Most tree species used in forestry are lsquomastingrsquo species, producing good seed crops in certain years with low levels or no seed at all in intervening years.ldquoAs much as two-thirds of that available seed can be lost through predation, weed competition, drought or simply a failure to germinate.ldquoThatrsquos a substantial loss of viable material, so finding ways of meeting any or all of those challenges would greatly improve on the number of saleable tree seedlings that are grown.With it taking up to  years to create a new seed orchard ndash longer for certain species ndash there is mounting need to find a way to maximise the efficiency of current stocks and meet calls for millions of new trees to be planted in order to meet climate change needs.Mr Knox said previous Innovation Challenges have seen ideas flood in often from unexpected sectors and even from lsquogarden shedrsquo inventors.ldquoOur first Challenge was around non-chemical alternatives to controlling a particular pest. We found some people with no experience of forestry sector come forward with fantastic ideas, he added. ldquoIt is entirely possible that someone in a garden shed with a little bit of funding could develop their idea and help us find a solution.Innovators who come up with potentially viable ideas are given funding and support to develop their concept, with a share of up to pound, available to five businesses selected for lsquopre-commercialrsquo contracts.Whoever does hit on a proven solution, however, could also find lucrative markets in other countries that operate a similar style of forestry to the UK, such as Norway, Sweden, France, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.Previous attempts to find a solution to seedling loss have included the use of mycorrhizae fungi to coat some seeds prior to sowing in order to improve germination and subsequent plant growth. The mycorrhizae live in or on the plantsrsquo roots and make phosphate, nitrogen and other nutrients and water available to help boost growth.Soil sterilisation technology has also been used to help tackle weeds, while some early work has been done using existing robotics and seed coating technology which involves covering seeds in a polymer coating. Itrsquos thought that coating the seeds with beneficial properties such as anti-drought or bird repellent could also be explored.One use of robotics in forestry could be in helping to sort out unviable seeds which have been previously identied by imaging technology as dead or infected with parasites, added Mr Knox.However, the scale of Scotlandrsquos forestry industry ndash Forestry and Land Scotland is responsible for growing  million trees a year which are transplanted to national forests ndash means certain technologies, such as fully-automated production lines, would be too costly and dficult to introduce on the large scale required.Mr Knox added: ldquoThere is a lot of robotics and automation in nurseries in Europe that grow stock in little inidual pots. But here we broadcast seed on prepared ground. Any solution has to be suitable for the UK market.Robots are increasingly finding their way into environmental solutions. Tree planting robots have been developed in Canada to plant trees up to  times faster than a human, at around half the cost. Meanwhile, a firm in Oxford has been looking at how to use drones to plant trees in particularly challenging landscapes.Mr Knox added: ldquoAs well as being vital to Scotlandrsquos effort against the climate emergency, improvements in yield would help ensure the security of future timber supply for Scotlandrsquos thriving poundBn forestry industry and its contribution to Scotlandrsquos economy.A lsquobidder dayrsquo event will be held at FLSrsquos tree nursery near Elgin next Monday.

Questioning our inidual impact on the environment is fashionable now and a part of current public conversation. Earlier this year the American politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued that it is a \"legitimate question\" whether or not to have children in the current environment.Harrys views, then, are nothing new. Nor is Meghans decision to guest edit a magazine. The Duchess of Cambridge guest edited the Huffington Post while Prince Harry guest edited Radio Four. If anything should stick in the craw, its that members of a royal family which vocally despises the press quite enjoy trying a hand at journalism themselves. But thats perhaps a niche complaint.As well as mulling over who shall inherit the earth, Harry mulled over with Jane Goodall how we inherit our prejudices with regard to unconscious racist bias. \"Just as stigma is handed down from generation to generation, your perspective on the world and on le and on people is something that is taught to you.\"Harrys views are, though, new to him and his awokening, from Nazi fancy dress costume to nuanced understanding of racial discrimination, is no doubt heavily influenced by his educated, politically aware, feminist we. No bad thing, yet somehow it is.It was to be expected that Prince Harrys we - no matter who she was - would attract public scrutiny. Meghan, a well-established woman with a mind of her own, could never have been expected to twist herself into the shape of the demur, modest royal the public and the right leaning press desire.What Britain asks of its royals is to play a very specic game. To have insight into the struggles of their subjects despite living le at great remove. To be modest despite great riches. To be hard working without any real context for what hard work entails.Meghan was a celebrity, an Instagram influencer and a lestyle blogger and, now a senior royal, she has carried on regardless.Harry and Meghan are far enough removed from the throne that we should be able to say good luck to them. Behave like the Clooneysyou so wish. Even behave like the Kardashiansyou must.We cant say this, however, and there are two sticking points. One, the Kardashian and Clooney money is self-made: the Sussexes are part publicly funded. Two, celebrities promote only themselves the royal family is representing the United Kingdom. We should, it follows, have a say in how we want to be represented.For a pass-remarkable British public which respects the Queen for her apolitical, wide-ranging charitable support, the Sussexes are easy targets for traditionalists. No one likes to be preached to and heres rich Harry chiding people for eating fruit wrapped in plastic, while scooting about on private jets.The British upper lip stfens at the notion of schmaltzy instructions to \"be the change\" and \"live in the deep like a mermaid\". Britain expects access to its royal family in exchange for their luxuries so asking for privacy - keeping the lid of Archies christening, turning Frogmore Cottage into a fortress, forbidding photos at Wimbledon - ruffle feathers.Yet Meghan has been protective of her privacy since day one. Think on her engagement announcement interview: she would not be drawn on the identity of the matchmaker who brought her and her fianceacute together because she wanted to protect them.:Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle announce engagementIt stands to reason she would be reluctant to put her sons godparents in the spotlight and hypocritical of her to change her stance. Shes basically being lambasted for sticking to her principles and this is part of the problem: so many of the things initially attributed to making Meghan a breath of fresh air have been turned against her.The Sussexes are taking joint decisions as a household yet Meghan is the target of the associated flak. Four of the biggest gun right-wing columnists have used their  this week to try to take her down a peg or two. Her Vogue stewardship has been the source of television debate Eamonn Holmes on This Morning labelled her with the deeply problematic epithet \"uppity\".This flak comes in response to her doing things other royals have done before and singling her out in this way smacks of racism. From some quarters it does more than smack.She has been criticised for wearing too few British designers for how she touched her bump while pregnant for how she has influenced Harry for being rude to Palace staff for feuding with Kate Middleton. All othering, racist, sexist critiques.It is one thing to dislike the Sussexes as a brand and entirely another to claw and claw at Meghan Markle. Youd think we might have learned a lesson about tearing at royal women in this way.

She grew up in LA, home of the movie business.Like many other US Monroes, her fatherrsquos line could be traced back to John Munro, a soldier from the area around Tain, who travelled to America in the mid-th century.He was one of many Scotsmen who fought for the Royalist cause during the English Civil War only to be exiled after its defeat by Oliver Cromwell and is believed to have settled in what is now the US state of Rhode Island.Despite the connection, no Munro men who shared the same signature pattern of the male or Y chromosome had been found in Scotland, so the link to the Highland clan was uncertain. Until now.The Clan Munro DNA project has finally proved Marilynrsquos forefathers were related to a Munro family from Edinkillie.Descendants of this Munro family, some of whom emigrated to the Bahamas in the th century, carry the unique and elusive Y chromosome marker previously found only in descendants of the exiled John Munro.:Herald Archive: When Marilyn Monroe seemed to be at her happiestAnother member of the Moray family, William Munro, emigrated from Scotland to Batavia, now Jakarta in Indonesia, in the early th century.Previously the Munro DNA project found that US President James Monroe was of a dferent male line, most closely related to the Munros of Teaninich Castle in Alness.The discovery comes two years after an appeal for Scots clan members to help confirm the origin of Monroersquos ancestors.The project began after it was discovered that an ancestor of Monroe was a soldier exiled to America after the English Civil War and launched an appeal to find more ancestors.The search was unveiled amid much fanfare to coincide with what would have been Monroersquos th birthday, with Clan Munro USA offering free test kits to Munro men of Highland origin in summer .One year later, the associationrsquos genealogy committee said it was ldquosurprised more Scots had not taken up the offer of the free test kits but that they remained hopeful.Initially, amid deepening suspicious from the Scottish side of the family, the trail ran cold.The one Munro found to be related to Marilyn Monroe failed to respond to any contact from the Americans, suggesting he wanted nothing to do with the project, even after initially volunteering his DNA.Hector Munro, , chief of the Munro clan, acknowledged that there was a vast dference in attitudes between the Americans and their Scottish counterparts when it came to tracing their lineage.:Iconic star Marilyn Monroes ancestors come from small Scottish villageldquoThe Scots think they know their history so they arenrsquot as keen to get involved, he told Theafter the search launched in . ldquoThe further people get away from the Highlands, the more interested they are.

They must be allowed to remain so.“Scotland faces plenty of health challenges and I suggest that we focus on those rather than getting side-tracked by a suggestion like this which is obviously going nowhere”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These would be in place for up to three years, although it is unlikely that they would be required for thisof time.The equipment used on the met masts gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.Orkney Islands Council announced in April that is was intending to investigate an additional two sites for potential community wind farms in the county — to add to the project already under investigation on Hoy.The new sites under consideration are located at Faray, in the North Isles, and at Quanterness in St Ola.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

Oh, Ruth. As seductive it may seem for the Scottish Tory leader to look towards Canada for solutions to her problems, it just isn’t that simple.The past fortnight could count as the worst in Ruth Davidson’s political career. She has seen the embodiment of everything she’s tried to change in Tory politics take charge of her party and enter Downing Street, triumphant. One of Boris Johnson’s first acts in office was to sack Davidson’s ‘work husband’, David Mundell, who is among her closest political allies and friends. Johnson’s Government is now eagerly marching the country towards a no-deal clf.Hence the latest flurry of suggestions, borrowing from Canada, for a breakaway party in Scotland – the Tory north, strong and free. Murdo Fraser revived his proposal from the  Scottish Tory leadership election, citing the Coalition Avenir Quebec– the governing party of Canada’s second-biggest province, a centre-right pro-business group that embraces key strands of nationalism while rejecting separation. It was formed from the merger of two groups that broke away from the Parti Quebecois, the francophone nationalist party of government since the s.: What Scottish unionists can learn from decline of Quebec’s separatists – Murdo FraserFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereOn John Beattie’s Radio Scotland programme on Monday, the former Scottish Conservative head of communications Andy Maciver also invoked a Canadian solution. In Alberta, the heartland of Canadian conservatism, the Conservative Party of Canada no longer exists at a provincial level. The government in Edmonton is run by the independent United Conservative Party, formed from the merger of what was the Canada-wide Progressive Conservative Party and the local, populist Wildrose Party.Both seemed to suggest that was evidence an independent party could succeed in Scotland. Maybe. But, like Kenny MacAskill in yesterday’s Scotsman, I believe building a separate Conservative brand in Scotland would be easier said than done – for two reasons in particular.First, in a devolved political system, it helps to be in government when you’re dferentiating yourself from the centre. Scottish Labour at Holyrood forged its identity and enacted some of Scotland’s most radical reforms when it did so in defiance of Tony Blair the SNP was confirmed as the natural party of government once it could argue it was standing up for Scotland against Tory London. It’s harder for Davidson to fight that fight from opposition like Wendy Alexander when Labour were out of power in Edinburgh, in Johnson’s first week in office the Scottish Tory leader got squashed.Second, you can only leverage one nationalist or constitutional ide at a time. In Alberta, the right has been fuelled by anger that the province’s oil wealth was being squandered by the federal government. In Quebec, the linguistic, cultural and constitutional ides remain strong even with the question of independence apparently settled. In both provinces, when these political forces have been split between dferent parties, the door opens for their rivals. When they have come together, as under the United Conservative Party and the CAQ, they dominate.But Scotland now has two cleavages, and one of them runs right through the Scottish Conservative Party. Davidson is losing support on one side to the Brexit Party, while pro-EU unionists now have an alternative in a revitalised Liberal Democrats – with a Scottish leader, too.The independence movement is no monolith, and the SNP’s struggles are well-documented, but while support for independence continues to sit at nearly  per cent, Nicola Sturgeon’s party has solid foundations. If there’s anything the Canadian example tells us, it’s that unionism needs a single, dominant force – but we’re not about to see any mergers there.Independence for the Scottish Tories would solve half their troubles, at best. A northwest passage out of Davidson’s problems will be hard to find.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"oh please no edinburgh resident goes viral after fringe rehearsal note left in her stairwell","story":"A Twitter user posted on the site a picture of a note left in her stair from The Counterminers who are her neighbours.window.twttr : Rare Harry Potter book bought for £ sells for almost £,She added just three words: Oh please no.The note advised that rehearsals would be taking place in their flat in the upcoming weeks - for their Fringe show about a monster in a wardrobe - revealing there would be shouting.Its author added: Please dont call the police.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bombay street play brings back memories for roma","story":"BRASSNECK Theatre Company’s latest productiontells the story of the burning of Bombay Street.Something in the Air will take to the stage at the Roddy’s for a limited run during the annual Féile an Phobail. Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened. We were trying to get home to Andersonstown, my aunt was burnt out of Dover Street. “There is a line in the play about ‘ordinary people living in extraordinary times’. I remember driving through the chaos that night, you just got on with it,” she said. Actor Mary Jordan’s character is now a researcher after “turning her back” on her former banking career during the Celtic Tiger. “My character becomes very interested in Rosie’s story and to learn that there were refugees from Belfast. She comes to visit Rosie to hear more and I can’t say anymore than that,” she added cryptically. “Audiences will find out more as the play progresses.”Something in the Air will run at the Roddy McCorley Social Club from Wednesday August  until Sunday August .Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the bar."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"family of joe burns raise over 3000 in","story":"THE family of a popular barman at The Chester have surpassed the £, mark in their fundraising efforts to keep his memory alive.Joe Burns died suddenly five years ago in July , aged just  after collapsing at his parent’s home.Joe was a fit and healthy boxer who trained regularly at the gym.Tragically, the day after his death, his girlfriend Sinead discovered she was pregnant with their daughter Bella who is now four-years-old.Soon after Joe’s death, his family learned Joe’s mum Una and sister Jeanette both carry the faulty gene for Long QT, an inherited condition that can cause heart rhythm disturbances. Left undiagnosed, it can cause sudden death where someone has an unexpected cardiac arrest.Every year since, Joe’s family and friends take part in the annual Belfast Marathon, with all proceeds going towards the British Heart Foundation who use the money to fund research into silent heart conditions.This year,  members of Joe’s family and friends raised £, from their Marathon efforts. Their recent fundraising efforts have brought their overall total since Joe’s death to an amazing £, for the charity.Joe’s sister Jeanette O’Neill said: “This is the third year we have taken part in the Belfast Marathon for the BHF in Joe’s memory. Each year we just keep getting bigger and better with more people from our community getting involved through the full marathon, fun run and relay.“When Joe died our family was absolutely devastated. He was a real character and everyone knew him. He made such a big impact on so many people and it’s amazing that so many of his friends are still so supportive and want to help our fundraising efforts.“We don’t want what happened to our family to happen to any other family so that’s why we fundraise for the BHF because their research into conditions like Long QT are making such a big dference.”Jeanette said they have been overwhelmed by the support from their local community since Joe’s death.“Friends and family have just been fantastic. We are also hugely grateful to the Thunderdome in Glengormley for hosting a buffet for Joe’s runners after the marathon. It gave us a chance to get together after the event and share stories about Joe.

Obviously whats really important for me and for our BBC audience is protecting our impartiality.He added: \"We have to be clear and careful that there arent any possibilities of perceived impartiality issues. I also want at the same timeto support the staff and that network and to help and support them.\"He denied a suggestion that the BBC have done a U-turn on the issue.\"Nothing has actually changed, all I was trying to do today is clary things and I obviously wasnt around when some of this material went out and its caused some confusion. I want to set the record straight for all staff to understand these matters and what their responsibilities and opportunities are,\" he said.Peter Johnson said hes happy to apologise to staff about how the issue has been handled.\"Im apologising for the confusion we created previously.

The BBC denied that staff members attended the parade affected its decision-making about its output.Mr Johnston intervened on Friday morning, the day before the parade, to clary the situation after ing to work from leave.In an earlier statement he confirmed that BBC Pride staff network will be taking part in the parade with colleagues, friends and family.He said: \"It is clear there has been some confusion about the terms and basis for BBC staff involvement in the Belfast Pride Parade. We know that there are legislative issues specic to Northern Ireland in relation to same-sex marriage.

At the end of that period the Government has agreed that the current fee should be replaced by a new “device independent broadcasting charge”.The Government will decide the amount of the charge, with funds to be allocated to broadcasters by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.Communications Minister @RichardbrutonTD has announced reform of the #TVlicence fee system. He said the dependence on the ownership of a television was becoming “outdated” and it needed to move towards a device basis for levelling the broadcasting licence fee @PA pic VlLlZlt— Michelle DevaneAugust , Communications Minister Richard Bruton announced the changes, which are designed to ensure sustainable funding of public service broadcasting. The measures are contained in the BroadcastingBill.Mr Bruton said public service broadcasting is more important than ever but it has to be recognised that the landscape in which broadcasters operate is undergoing a signicant change, with audiences increasingly moving away from traditional s and accessing online content through devices.“The dependence on the ownership of a television is becoming outdated and we need to move to a device independent basis for levelling the broadcasting licence fee,” he said, adding that it was clearly a “challenge” to develop and construct a new system that would take account of the move towards devices.As a result he said the Government was “not in a position to go ahead” with the changes immediately.“There’s a bit of work to be done to make sure that that’s robust,” he said.He added the Government did not want to change the law only for technological changes to quickly make it “irrelevant”.“What we want to do is create something that’s robust for the long term,” Mr Bruton said. We don’t want to be revisiting this as technology changes.”This is a fundamental reform that will take time to develop, but it will future proof the funding model, taking account of changes in technology and in how content is now consumed.— Richard BrutonAugust , While the details of who will be liable to pay the new charge have yet to be finalised, it will mean households with a tablet, smartphone or laptop who access content will have to pay the charge, regardless of whether they have a TV set.It is designed to tackle evasion and ensure all those accessing content are liable for the fee.It is estimated that about % of households evade the current -euro fee, while another % legally avoid paying the fee because they do not own a TV set.Mr Bruton said there was a high level of evasion but it was coming down.“It was %, it’s come down to around a little over %, but that is clearly a very high level of evasion, and we believe by having a new tender with a guaranteed five-year period it will give an opportunity to cut that evasion rate, as has happened in other countries,” he said.Critics have said the planned reform will amount to a new charge on every household in the country.Mr Bruton replied: “It’s not fair to call it a household charge until we work out the basis. What we’re trying to do is to get people to contribute and evolve from a particular device that is being superseded by others.”He said the principle of paying for content remained the same.Asked whether enforcement would be an issue and whether the new device charge would be workable, Mr Bruton said: “That remains to be seen. I think it can be made workable but we need to take care that it doesn’t become a leaky ship.”He added that the Government needs to design the system is a way that people would accept.Mr Bruton also announced a review of the Broadcasting Act, to evaluate the proportion of TV licence revenue which is allocated to the Sound and Vision Scheme, which supports the independent sector and native Irish contentThe review will also consider the minimum amount of funding RTE is obliged to spend on commissioning external content. In  this amounted to . million euro.Mr Bruton said increasing this amount would provide an important stimulus to the independent production sector and that the objective of the review was to “see how we can best support original Irish content production”."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group ready support development north west institution","story":"The Derry University Group has said it is willing to “advise and support” the local council in establishing an independent university in the city.A meeting was held between Council Chief Executive John Kelpie, Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, and the new Secretary of State for NI this week where the ongoing campaign for a Medical school at Magee was discussed.The Derry University Groupfelt it was a prime opportunity to impress upon SoS Julian Smith the need for an independent university in the city.This month, Derry City  Strabane District Councillors unanimously backed a motion supporting the exploration of all options for university provision in the North West. That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"studio2 summer dance","story":"Greater Shantallow Community Arts are seeking participants for their annual Summer Dance Camp.If you are between --years-old this is a fantastic opportunity to take part in an two-week long exciting event.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"removing complication","story":"Be more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitBe more active and to stick to your calorie deficit.\" Removing the Complication of it all, says Mark Davies of Zenith FitGet your training off to a great start with this special offer.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"burglary llanidloes see hear anything","story":"Library image of police tape\" Burglary in Llanidloes – did you see or hear anything Library image of police tape\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"re off race life llanfair caereinion   picture special","story":"Caereinion High School pupils and staff took part in the Race For Le -

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

They opened the scoring through Gareth George and he added a free to give the visitors an early cushion.Indeed, Bright had plenty more chances to add to this score, but were wasteful in their shot selection. The Holywood men finally woke up and a tidy score from Connor McAnespie after  minutes opened their account.Bright again replied with a fine score from Marc Burke before Martin Cox opened his account for Holywood with a point after  minutes. Barry Kilkey levelled the contest three minutes later from close range and Freddie OrsquoConnor scored for Bright to edge them ahead again.Foolish tackling and unnecessary frees were costing St Paulrsquos in the game and helped Bright dominate the play In the first half.The gamersquos opening goal, however, swung the play towards the Holywood men again. Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos. Paddy Falls high tackle left George with a handy free to cut the deficit before Tucker added a free from m out on the left.George added the final score of the half for Bright leaving St Paulrsquos two points clear at the half-time whistle - to -.Bright again took the early initiative at the start of the second half and a point by Rian Tempany set the early tone. A big talking point came at six minutes into the second half when referee John McMullan sent off two players, one from each team after an altercation at a break downThe next few scores were to and fro with Tucker scoring three points and George replying in kind, aided by Tempany. The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score.

He did, however, admit that the itinerary has been sent to Rome.Venues for the Popersquos visit are pure speculation and certainly newspapers are free to speculate, he added.It is understood that Downpatrick was one of the three venues north of the border suggested by the committee of  bishops, headed by Cardinal OrsquoFiaich, when they met last week.The decision on whether the Pope will include Northern Ireland in his tour will be taken in Rome, but it is believed that alternative venues in the Republic have been suggestedthe Pope decides not to cross the border.The choice of Downpatrick mdash with its strong historical links with Christianity and St Patrick mdash is understood to have been a move to give the Pope the opportunity to see as many people as possible.It is also thought that Armagh mdash the ecclesiastical headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland mdash and Londonderry were studied as possible venues for a visit.Until the programme is finalised, the only places certain to be included in the itinerary are Dublin and the Marian Shrine at Knock, County Mayo.Dr Joseph Maguire, Parish Priest of Downpatrick, said that he personally had not been contacted about any visit from Pope John Paul II, but he admitted that Downpatrick would have been one of the first places to think of.ldquoWe would be delighted to be so honoured with a visit from the Holy Father and he would be most welcome he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash A one-day token strike by production workers closed the Killyleagh Mill yesterday.Around  workers walked out, seeking a wages increase.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed. It is thought that charges for cars to the beach will be scrapped.Other developments at the beach will include the provision of new toilet blocks and the construction of - self-catering holiday homes for renting.NEWCASTLE mdash A new peal of six church bells will ring out over Newcastle this year.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.
