If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Tensions flare Kenosha Rittenhouse jury starts deliberations","story":"   Mark McCloskey is currently running for a U.S. Senate seat, representing Missouri.On Monday they were in Kenosha to show their support for Rittenhouse. \u0027We feel for Mr. Rittenhouse,\u0027 Mark McCloskey told Fox News. \u0027We feel he acted in self-defense. We think he\u0027s been politically prosecuted, as were we, and we\u0027re hoping that the jury find him not guilty on all counts and that he can go home a free man,\u0027 he added.  adverts.addToArray({pos:mpu_factbox})Advertisement"},{"url":null,"title":"Amazon wont accept payments UK Visa credit cards 2022","story":"Share this article\u0027You can update your Prime membership here, and if you have any subscriptions on Amazon.co.uk, you can update them on the \u0027\u0027manage your subscription\u0027\u0027 page here.\u0027We know this may be inconvenient, and we\u0027re here to help you through this transition so you can continue enjoying Amazon\u0027s low prices and wide selection. \u0027Please visit this help page for more information on payment methods, or go directly to your account.\u0027 Jo Thornhill, money expert at MoneySuperMarket, told MailOnline: \u0027Amazon\u0027s announcement that it will stop accepting visa credit cards from January is bad news for consumers as it will reduce choice when it comes to how they pay when making purchases with the online retailer.\u0027If this announcement impacts you, we\u0027d recommend you wait to see how this saga plays out over the coming weeks, as it could be the case that Amazon and Visa are able to sort out this situation before any blocks are put in place.\u0027However if, come January, Amazon has stuck to its decision and you like using credit cards for online payments due to the protection they provide you under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, you could always look for a new card to meet your needs. \u0027There are lots of great offers out there, including cards providing interest free purchases for up to 23 months.\u0027And CNBC technology expert Ryan Browne added: \u0027It could be a way to get some bargaining power over Visa to lower fees. \u0027Smaller retailers aren\u0027t in a position to negotiate, but Amazon - given its size - might be.

Immunity from a single dose, however, wanes more quickly. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at UKHSA, said: \u0027The Covid vaccines are very safe. \u0027Based on a highly precautionary approach, we are advising a longer interval between Covid infection and vaccination for those aged under 18. \u0027This increase is based on the latest reports from the UK and other countries, which may suggest that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination will further reduce the already very small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups.\u0027Young people and parents should be reassured that myocarditis is extremely rare, at whatever point they take up the vaccine, and this change has been made based on the utmost precaution.\u0027\u0027We keep all advice under constant review and will revise it according to the latest data and evidence.\u0027UK Government data justifying today\u0027s update shows nine in every million under-18s in the UK will get myocarditis after a single dose of Pfizer\u0027s Covid jab, the same as around one per 110,000. But for every million doses of the vaccine administered to children, they will prevent around 150 hospitalisations from Covid.The JCVI held off on recommending second doses for children because data from Israel and the US suggested the myocarditis risk is as high as one in 10,000.  But real-world UK data in slightly older adults - who also saw above normal rates of myocarditis in other countries - was not higher after the second jab.This is thought to be because the dosing gap between doses here is 12 weeks, whereas it\u0027s between three and four weeks in the US and Israel. The JCVI believes that 12-week gap might also be the sweet spot for getting a jab after natural infection in young people, which prompted today\u0027s tweak to the guidance. There is also evidence that rates of myocarditis in Britain are similar in 16 and 17-year-olds and 18 to 29-year-olds, after the second jab.This is why the JCVI recommend two jabs for healthy older teens earlier this week. But it is still weighing up the evidence on younger children. It is unclear why the longer space between vaccination or natural infection reduces the risk of myocarditis yet. This gap might give the immune system time to calm down from the reaction to the first dose or infection.  During Covid infection or immunisation, the body produces cells to fight the virus. If the disease-fighting cells enter the heart, they can inflame the muscle. "},{"url":null,"title":"House Fraser shut iconic Oxford Street shop year","story":"Food sales volumes were also up by 0.6 per cent, the ONS added, and remain 3.9 per cent above pre-Covid levels.But while shoppers opted to avoid high streets, sales online continued to rise and now account for 28.1 per cent of all spending - up from 27.9 per cent in August.There was a particular surge in department store sales online, up by 3.8 per cent, meaning nearly 10p in every £1 spent online goes to the likes of John Lewis, Debenhams or House of Fraser, the ONS said.By comparison, household goods stores saw a 3.6 per cent drop in online sales.Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u0027Household goods were the main driver of this month\u0027s decline, with a fall of nearly 10 per cent, while food sales ticked back up after falling last month.\u0027Petrol sales exceeded their pre-pandemic level for the first time, with filling stations reporting very strong sales during the last week of September.\u0027Despite the lifting of restrictions, in-store retail sales remain subdued, with many consumers still opting to shop online.\u0027Retail chiefs laid the blame at the doorstep of Government and urged ministers to find ways to reduce the issues with supply chains and high energy costs.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u0027Retailers will be concerned by the slump in sales, just as they begin their preparations for the all-important Christmas period.\u0027Fuel shortages, wet weather and low consumer confidence all contributed to lower consumer demand this month, with household goods, furniture and books all hit particularly hard.\u0027She added: \u0027For the sake of the UK\u0027s economic recovery, it is vital that retail sales bounce back as we near the festive season.\u0027Labour shortages across the supply chains, on farms, factories, warehouses and lorry drivers, all threaten to derail this recovery and it is vital that Government finds a long-term solution to this problem.\u0027Looking forward, commentators said the rest of the year could see traditional festive shopping patterns shift as a result of the problems.Silvia Rindone, EY UK and Ireland retail expert, said: \u0027Over recent years, shoppers have tended to wait until late December to buy for Christmas in the hope of bagging some great bargains.\u0027However this year, with news of supply chain disruption and supply concerns for key products, shoppers are likely to pull forward their non-perishable Christmas spending into October and November to make sure they get what they want.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"England cricket star Alex Hales DENIES calling black dog Kevin","story":"Share this articleAzeem Rafiq calls for \u0027total clear-out\u0027 of Yorkshire CCC leadership over racism scandal | UK News | Sky NewsAzeem Rafiq \u0027determined\u0027 sharing experiences of racism will be pivotal moment for sport and society - BBC SportYorkshire head coach Andrew Gale set to be sacked after Azeem Rafiq\u0027s damning testimony"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb7e0a8240ba3bf5ce8a3d3504170b6d336adfb/0_31_5458_3275/master/5458.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d79eed003e083ba50dac3f575a6c3c68","title":"arsenal v hb kge womens champions league live score updates","story":"He truly was a great among match reporters, the gold standard to which the best still aspire, and the ’s man at almost all the biggest games of the 70s, 80s and 90s.

Photograph: William CherryPresseyePA WireCovid-19 vaccine passports are to be introduced on a mandatory basis for people accessing certain venues in Northern Ireland from next month after Stormont ministers backed the move despite DUP opposition.Executive members from Sinn Féin, the UUP, the SDLP and Alliance all supported the plan from Stormont health minister Robin Swann, which will see the certs legally enforced for those attending nightclubs, bars, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and conference halls.Under the plan, people wishing to gain entry to the designated venues would need to demonstrate evidence of Covid-19 vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result or proof of infection in the previous six months. Non-compliant venues could face a £1,000 fine.Certs would also be needed for indoor events with 500 or more attendees where some or all attendees are not normally seated, outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees where some or all are not normally seated and events with 10,000 or more attendees whether the audience is seated or not.The DUP has called for a vote in the Assembly before the policy is introduced but it has not deployed a cross-community voting mechanism that could have blocked their introduction. Grace periodMr Swann wants the regulations needed for the law change come into effect on November 29th, with a 14-day grace period before they become enforceable on December 13th. He is also to draw up a package of others measures aimed at increasing compliance with current pandemic rules and guidance and driving vaccination rates up.“Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down,” he said. “Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act.”Northern Ireland’s Department of Health on Wednesday reported a further 12 deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 and a further 1,848 cases. There were 427 Covid-positive patients in hospitals, including 33 people in intensive care.Covid-19 transmission rates have soared in Northern Ireland in recent weeks, particularly among young people.A modelling paper from health officials presented to the Executive ahead of Wednesday’s meeting warned passports may not be enough to suppress the rising rate of infections, which has risen by 23 per cent in a week. DUP First Minister Paul Givan criticised the vaccine cert policy as “isive” and claimed it would have “marginal” impact on reducing transmission rates.‘Two-tier’ systemHe said it would create a “two-tier” system whereby certification was required for certain private sector businesses but not for accessing public services.“We look at the Republic of Ireland that has had this scheme in, and their rates of transmission are much higher than Northern Ireland,” he said.Sinn Féin minister Conor Murphy said “action taken now can prevent more serious action having to be taken in the future” and that the aim was to do “all we can” to ensure that businesses can remain open in the build-up to Christmas. SDLP minister Nichola Mallon, who has been calling for vaccine passports for two months, criticised the DUP position and asked what alternatives the party was proposing to tackle spiralling transmission rates.Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “I don’t want anyone to think that a Covid passporting scheme is a silver bullet to that wider problem.“Each of us needs to take personal responsibility for ensuring that insofar as possible we reduce our amount of social contact, try to keep social distancing in place and wear our masks and comply with all other regulations.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid conundrum why is ireland worse off than most of western europe","story":"The latest data from the UK on boosters is very encouraging.

Photograph: Collins PhotosCancelling social plans in the run-up to Christmas is a “responsible” decision, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, who has urged people to reduce social contacts amid an ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases in Ireland.Speaking one day after new measures were introduced to combat the spread of the virus, Dr Holohan said these were “decisions that nobody wants to be taking at this time of the year”.The Department of Health confirmed 3,633 new cases of Covid-19 in the State on Wednesday. As of 8am on Wednesday, 634 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, an increase of 20 on Tuesday. Of the latest total, 119 were in ICU.A further 43 deaths related to Covid-19 have been newly notified in the past week (since last Wednesday). This brings to 5,609 the total number of deaths related to Covid-19 notified in the State.Asked on RTÉ Radio’s News at One whether office Christmas parties should be cancelled, Dr Holohan said: “We’re advising people to stay at home as much as possible and work from home - those would be responsible decisions, if they were to be taken.”As for cancelling social plans generally, he said: “I know that this is the case, and I know it from my own life, that people are making these kind of decisions as ways of reducing their own risk and ways of reducing the risk to their loved ones, their friends and family and so on…“To me those are responsible decisions now that people are making.”The Government announced several measures on Tuesday aimed at curbing the fourth wave of the virus, which is placing hospitals and the health service under major pressure.People were advised to work from home a midnight closing time will be imposed on bars and nightclubs and close contacts of a case in the same household must restrict movements for five days. Covid-19 passes were also extended to cinemas and theatres, although many in the sector had already required customers to show the certs.Infection modellingDr Holohan on Wednesday said that 200,000 people who could potentially be infected in December had not yet been infected and transmission could be avoided if people took action now.“There is no single measure on its own that will curb this. We need to use all of the measures together and use them properly and appropriately,” he said.If 200,000 people became infected next month, as was predicted through modelling, that would mean 4,000 people would be hospitalised over the Christmas period, he said.“The most important measures are the things that you as an inidual can do. Wash your hands, wear a mask, limit your contacts, avoid crowds,” he urged.Minister for Education Norma Foley on Wednesday called on parents to minimise social contacts for their children including play dates and birthday parties for children.Dr Holohan called on anyone who had symptoms to isolate and get a PCR test, not an antigen test. Their close contacts should also restrict their movements.When asked about Nphet’s position on antigen tests, Dr Holohan said he had always said they had a role to play “in some circumstances” but that people could not rely on a negative test result to conclude they did not have Covid and could socialise.Antigen testsMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly on Wednesday said current advice for a plan to encourage widespread use of antigen tests was against providing the rapid tests free of charge.Prices of about €8 per test were “too much”, and the Government would be announcing a scheme to subsidise the tests in the coming days, the cost of which would likely run to several hundred million euros, he said.“The advice I have is they shouldn’t be free – they had them free in the UK, and the government came under huge criticism from parliament for that, because essentially there were no controls on how they were being used at all,” he said.The Health Service Executive (HSE) is currently sending packs of five antigen tests to people deemed close contacts, he said.When asked if a circuit breaker lockdown would eventually be needed to halt the rise in cases, Mr Donnelly said “nobody can answer that question right now,” later adding that things “can never be ruled out”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney also said further restrictions could not be ruled out, and voiced concern that “too many people” were not turning up for Covid-19 booster shots.However, the World Health Organisation’s special envoy on Covid-19, Dr David Nabarro, said he did not think that Ireland was heading back into strict lockdown.Speaking on RTÉ Radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Dr Nabarro said although the figures at present were high, he was hopeful, especially since the country had acted quickly.He said the Government had a clear idea of what was going on, “there will have to be some restrictions, but I don’t get a feeling that you’re moving into stringent lockdown, I very much hope that won’t happen.”Mr Martin said it remained to be seen if the changes “will be sufficient” and he said he was “not ruling out further measures” in the future, with the situation to be reviewed in a number of weeks.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment would not be reopened for people who may lose their jobs in nightclubs, a move that Opposition parties have criticised.Fine Gael Senator Regina Doherty on Wednesday criticised the plan not to provide free antigen tests to the public, describing it as a “serious mistake” given the amount spent on other pandemic supports.PriorityOn schools, Ms Foley said “at every stage” she had made the case for giving the education sector “due consideration” for priority when it comes to vaccines and boosters.Speaking on RTÉ Radio, she said she understood that by the end of this week the HSE would have a plan in place for the operation of antigen testing in schools.The Minister acknowledged that there were challenges such as the number of substitute teachers available. A suite of measures had been introduced, she said.It was up to “each one of us inidually to hunker down for the next couple of weeks”.Ms Foley said she did not know if further restrictions would be required or if schools might not reopen in January. It was an issue for wider society, and “we must all shoulder the responsibility”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"fg senators accuse donnelly of communication blunders","story":"Fianna Fáil TD and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly came under sustained criticism at a Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday evening for a series of recent media interviews in relation to the pandemic.Sources said that Senator Mary Seery Kearney raised an issue with an interview given by the Fianna Fáil minister last week where he said that the Government was not at that time considering a work-from-home policy.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) met later that day and recommended that the Government revert to a policy of working from home where possible.Ms Seery Kearney is understood to have compared the comments to a notorious interview given by Dermot Ahern and Noel Dempsey in 2010 when they denied talk of a potential EU-IMF bailout for the State.Ms Kearney told the meeting that it gave the impression of saying one thing in the morning and doing another thing in the evening, criticising the communications strategy.Her fellow senator Martin Conway also criticised an interview Mr Donnelly gave to Newstalk on Wednesday morning and said that it was “less than satisfactory.”He also told the meeting that if the Government does not get the communications strategy on Covid right, it will start to lose the support of the public.In relation to the midnight curfew for nightclubs and bars, which comes into effect from Thursday, Mr Conway told the meeting that the Government should be honest and say that it was effectively closing the sector.The meeting also heard calls for the Government to reconsider its position on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).From Wednesday, the €250 PUP rate will reduce to €203 per week — the standard jobseeker’s rate. The PUP rate of €300 will reduce to €250. Sinn Féin has called on the Government to ensure workers receive a full payment in light of the new curfew.Senator Jerry Buttimer is understood to have called on the Government to re-examine its stance during the parliamentary party meeting. He was also critical of the Government’s messaging on Covid-19.The latest modelling of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ireland shows that we urgently need to reduce transmission if we are to avoid further dangerous increases in cases and hospitalisations. Stay home with symptoms, limit contacts, use basic mitigations. 120 pic.twitterahR6IKFeH0— Professor Philip Nolan (@PhilipNolan_MU) On vaccines, the meeting heard that around 1,500 unvaccinated people are registering every day in order to receive a first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys told party colleagues that the country can give around 220,000 booster vaccines a week and that work is underway to increase this to 270,000.The Government is coming under increasing pressure to speed up its booster campaign after additional restrictions were announced on Tuesday in light of surging Covid-19 case numbers.The meeting was told that while vaccination centres were currently seeing 120,000 people each week, this will be increased to 160,000.Extra pharmacists alongside GPs will also be used in administering booster shots.Meanwhile, Nphet’s chair of modelling group Professor Philip Nolan has released data forecasting hospitalisations from Covid rising to 4,000 by the end of December.As of 8am on Wednesday, 634 Covid-19 patients were in hospital, an increase of 20 on Tuesday.Undetected casesCase numbers will be determined by personal behaviour but also the level of natural immunity in the population, Prof Nolan stated.The number of positive cases of Covid-19 recorded in the State as of Wednesday was 511,045 but some models suggest that the number of people who have had Covid-19 and were not tested may be one and a half times that amount. For every four cases that are detected, six will go undetected.This equates to 1.3 million people or 22.5 per cent of the population who have had the virus and have therefore built up some level of immunity.Prof Nolan said this was an optimistic scenario and if the level of natural immunity drops by a third it could see a peak in excess of 10,000 cases per day in December.“This translates into more than 2,000 people in hospital and at least 400 people requiring critical care – these people couldn’t all be cared for in ICU, many would receive advanced respiratory support on wards and in high-dependency units,” he said on Twitter.The vaccination programme has reduced the level of hospital admissions relative to the number of people getting Covid-19.However, without further mitigation, there will be at least 200,000 cases in December, he warned, leading to at least 4,000 hospital admissions in a worst case scenario.“A small proportion of a large number of cases is a dangerously large number of hospitalisations,” he tweeted.He acknowledged the level of protection that the vaccine gives against infection - as opposed to serious illness - was “relatively low and the virus can spread easily”.Prof Nolan said Nphet’s modelling includes the impact of booster doses on the elderly population, but even with those, “an optimistic scenario sees over 6,000 cases per day at the end November, and a total of 200,000 cases in December”.He added: “This is avoidable. If we cut our contacts now, work on the basic mitigations, and take the booster when offered, we can prevent these infections and hospitalisations...“Please stay home if symptomatic and seek a PCR test. Restrict movements and do your antigen tests if a close contact. Work from home if possible. Prioritise your contacts, wash hands, wear masks, avoid crowds and ventilate spaces.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a clubs christmas parties and playdates what do the new covid restrictions allow","story":"Bars, restaurants and nightclubs will have a new closing time of midnight from Thursday, November 18thIn response to climbing infections and pressure on the health service, the Government announced further changes to Covid-19 restrictions on Tuesday in tandem with new public health advice. What will it mean for you?HospitalityBars, restaurants and nightclubs will have a new closing time of midnight from Thursday, November 18th, with all customers required to be out of the premises by that time each night.Late night hospitality was previously required to close by 11.30pm, before the rules were relaxed last month, allowing nightclubs to reopen for the first time since the early days of Covid-19.While some nightclubs may opt to open at an earlier hour than normal, others in the sector will see the midnight curfew as an effective closure order .Hotel bars and restaurants will also be covered by the midnight curfew, with an exception for guests staying in the hotel - as had previously been the case with restrictions on hospitality.The midnight closing time will apply to functions booked in hotels, such as office work parties and weddings.Similarly, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said cancelling office parties, or other social plans and get-togethers over the next number of weeks, would be “responsible decisions”. People had a responsibility to reduce their social contacts, he said.Work from homePeople have been advised to return to working from home “unless it is necessary” to attend the workplace in person. Many employers had been in the process of arranging employees to return to offices on a phased basis since late September.Theatres and cinemasThe requirement to show a Covid pass, as proof of vaccination or recent recovery, has been extended to cinemas and theatres.Before the passes were required for indoor hospitality, as well as live music events, nightclubs and for international travel.Some cinemas and theatres had already required customers to show Covid certs, but the latest change will make the requirement mandatory.There were discussions about whether the Covid pass would be extended to hairdressers and gyms, but they were not included in the latest announcement.PlaydatesWhile there is no recommendation around numbers attending events such as playdates or children’s birthday parties, Minister for Education Norma Foley said such activities should now be minimised.“We need to be very vigilant and very restrictive in terms of our social engagements and that applies to families,” she said.Close contactsPeople who are close contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case in their household are now advised to restrict their movements for five days, even if vaccinated.Beforehand those who were fully vaccinated were not required to self-isolate or restrict their movements when listed as close contacts.Pandemic Unemployment PaymentThe Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) scheme, set up to support people who lost their jobs due to Covid-19, will not be reopened.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said there were plenty of vacancies elsewhere in the hospitality and retail sector, for nightclub staff who may lose their jobs. Nightclub owners could avail of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to continue to pay staff, she said.Antigen testsA plan to subsidise antigen tests to encourage wider use is due in the coming days, which is expected to see the costs of the rapid tests brought down from around €8 to €3 per test. Further measures around the use of antigen tests in schools will also be announced by the end of this week.The Health Service Executive currently posts packs of five free antigen tests to people listed as close contacts who do not have symptoms.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit deal on north possible by christmas claims uk s frost","story":"UK Brexit minister David Frost has said that the British government\u0027s preference is to strike a deal with the EU over Northern Ireland before Christmas. Video: ReutersBritish Brexit minister David Frost said on Wednesday his government’s preference is to strike a deal to improve post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland and that the agreement can be reached by Christmas.Britain and the EU agreed last week to intensify efforts to solve issues around the Northern Ireland protocol. Brussels cautiously welcomed a change in tone from London, though Mr Frost said “significant gaps” remained.“I think it can be done. Whether it will be done is another question,” Mr Frost told BBC Northern Ireland when asked if a deal could be reached by Christmas, as suggested by Minster for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.“We very much hope that we will be able to bring these talks to a conclusion, that’s what we would most like to do, but if we can’t, then obviously the famous Article 16 is a very real option for us,” he said, referring to emergency safeguard measures that could potentially lead to a trade war.Britain left the EU last year, but has since put off implementing some of the border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom that the bloc says London is obliged to make under their orce deal.London says the checks are disproportionate and are heightening tensions in Northern Ireland, putting a 1998 peace deal at risk.The EU’s chief negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, said on Monday he is “absolutely convinced” the sides can break the impasse if London engages on outstanding issues.Brussels has said it needs London to reciprocate with its own concessions after the EU offered to cut some of the checks needed on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.“The EU have made some proposals, at the moment without going into detail I’m not sure they would solve these problems of checks and processes for goods moving into Northern Ireland, but we keep talking and we’re seeing if we can move this forward in a way that does produce consensus,” Mr Frost said. – Reuters How is Brexit affecting you?

You don’t need to be a global warming sceptic to challenge what’s coming out.”He also encouraged people to look at the BBC and Sky and coverage of the foreign minister of Tuvalu.“Nobody pointed out there was a report that came out in 2018 which showed, in the last four years, the land mass in his island has increased by 70 hectares. Wasn’t that worth looking at? But, no, we just did it as a piece of PR.”Speaking to the Freeview Outside the Box conference, Mr Neil said that the BBC, Sky and US broadcasters “peddled, basically, conspiracy theories for two-and-a-half years that Mr Trump had only got to the White House because the Kremlin was behind him”.He went on: “For the first year or so of the Covid crisis, if you raised questions that there was more to it than just coincidence that Wuhan and Covid were in the same place, you were a sinophobe, a conspiracy theorist, and you weren\u0027t allowed to get on to the mainstream media.

However, most nations have shorter intervals between doses. On Wednesday night, JCVI members said the rollout of jabs to adults in Britain – with a gap of between eight and 12 weeks – suggests that, with a longer interval, there is almost no risk of myocarditis.The scientists said it seemed possible that, among those who had been naturally infected, a three-month gap might similarly reduce such risks.Prof Adam Finn, a member of the committee, said the advice had been changed in the light of emerging evidence.There are voices pushing for a much more black and white kind of line on this, that the public are going to be better off if we could give an absolutely clear and unequivocal message, he said.In a way we\u0027d love to be able to do that, but it\u0027s not good if it\u0027s not true. Ultimately, the whole value of the programme, and of all of our other programmes is that we\u0027re honest with the public.There are uncertainties around it – the risks are extremely small, but they exist, and the benefits are modest.Prof Finn also said it was likely that the committee would recommend second doses for 12 to 15-year-olds in the future. Earlier this week, it announced that 16 and 17-year-olds will start to be offered second doses after a 12-week gap.On Wednesday, officials stressed that the risks of heart inflammation remained very low. Health officials said most symptoms of myocarditis happen within a few days of vaccination, with most people recovering quickly. However, if younger people experience any of the following symptoms after receiving a vaccination, they should call 111 or see a GP:The new guidance only covers 12 to 15-year-olds who do not suffer from underlying conditions that increase their risk from Covid. Those in high-risk groups are still advised to have their jabs within a month of infection.Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency, said: The Covid-19 vaccines are very safe. Based on a highly precautionary approach, we are advising a longer interval between Covid infection and vaccination for those aged under 18.This increase is based on the latest reports from the UK and other countries, which may suggest that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination will further reduce the already very small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups.Officials said natural infection would keep children protected for at least three months and would protect them for some time beyond that.They said anyone over 18  should still take up their vaccine offer if it is four weeks since a positive case, given that the risk of complications from Covid rises with age.More from NewsLord Falconer would keep prestigious second job even if Labour’s sleaze reforms were adoptedPush to get civil servants back to the office by scrapping social distancingScotland is ‘worse than it has ever been’, says a former first minister as country stalls over issue of independenceBirds fake their own death to protect nests from squattersMass confusion over Covid vaccines for teenagers could make reluctant parents more nervousCannabis brownie ‘triggered psychotic episode in man who ran over girlfriend’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church facing commons investigation loophole allowed liverpool","story":"Liverpool terrorist Emad al-Swealmeen  (right in group of four) after being confirmed as a Christian by Rt Rev Cyril Ashton (second left) at Liverpool Anglican CathedralThe Liverpool bomber had been planning his Remembrance Sunday attack for at least eight months, counter-terror police have revealed. Emad al-Swealmeen rented a property in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, from April and it is thought that this became a suspected bomb factory. It has emerged that over the last eight months he had been buying the parts in order to build his explosive device. Swealmeen got a taxi from Rutland Avenue to Liverpool Women\u0027s Hospital on Sunday, and the vehicle blew up just as it rolled up to the main reception at 10.59am.The terrorist - who had suffered what has been described as mental health episodes in the past - died inside of injuries he sustained from the fire and explosion.It was also confirmed by counter-terror police that Swealmeen was born in Iraq. An Islamist plot is one line of inquiry being considered by police, although investigators are keeping an open mind and the motivation is yet to be established.Security services are also trying to determine whether or not the hospital or a nearby Remembrance Sunday service at the cathedral in which Swealmeen was confirmed was the intended target.  Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, from Counter-Terrorism Police North West, previously told journalists the explosive device had been manufactured and the force\u0027s assumption was that it was built by Swealmeen.The inquiry is examining, among other possibilities, whether the main charge on the device failed to explode and if the homemade explosive TATP was used.Searches have been carried out at an address in Rutland Avenue, and at a second property in Sutcliffe Street, where officers believe he previously lived.Four men arrested under terrorism laws in the Kensington area of Liverpool - three aged 21, 26 and 29, who were held on Sunday, and a man aged 20 who was detained on Monday - have now been released from police custody following interviews.Full statement from counter-terror policeAssistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said: The taxi in which the device exploded has now been removed and today line searches by specialist officers will take place at the hospital which could go into tomorrow.The post-mortem on the deceased has taken place and the cause of death has been described as injuries sustained from the fire and explosion.A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time.We have now traced a next of kin for Swealmeen who has informed us that he was born in Iraq.Our enquiries have found that Swealmeen has had episodes of mental illness, this will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand.There is much comment in the media about Swealmeen and it is clear that he was known to many people. We continue to appeal for people who knew him, especially those who associated with him this year as we try and piece together the events leading up to this incident and the reasons for it.At this time we are not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others.Cordon extended as bomb squad called to terrorist\u0027s old roadOn Wednesday afternoon, a Royal Logistics Corp bomb disposal vehicle arrived at Boaler Street along with a fire engine after a police cordon in nearby Sutcliffe Street - where officers believe Al Swealmeen previously lived - was extended and residents living within it were told they could not return home.Police said this was to allow officers to make an assessment of materials found in a property that we\u0027ve been searching, adding: This is only as a precaution.A Royal Logistic Cops Bomb Disposal van near Sutcliffe Street as the investigation continues following the explosion at the Liverpool Women\u0026#39s HospitalArmy Bomb Disposal team make their way to Sutcliffe StreetThe police cordon on Boaler Street has been extended after bomb disposal arrived at the scene.Media and members of the public who had gathered at the cordon were moved back by officers.The cordon extended past New Park Primary School and parents were told to collect children from a different entrance.Commons investigation into system that allowed bomber to stay in UKThe Church of England is facing a Commons investigation into the system that allowed the Liverpool bomber to stay in the UK despite several asylum rejections.Emad al-Swealmeen, 32, arrived in the UK from the Middle East in 2014 and had an application for asylum rejected, but was still in the country.Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, is understood to be appalled at the merry-go-round of failed asylum seekers changing religion and using other tactics to launch appeal after appeal to stay in the country.The Iraqi man killed in the abortive suicide bomb attack outside Liverpool Women\u0027s Hospital is understood to have been helped by the Church in his attempts to avoid being kicked out of Britain, after his claim for asylum was first rejected in 2014.An aerial shot of the burnt-out taxi outside Liverpool Women\u0026#39s HospitalAerial view of police activity after an explosion at the Liverpool Women\u0026#39s Hospital killed one person and injured another on Sunday. Suspected terrorist Emad Al Swealmeen, 32, died after the device exploded in a taxi shortly before 11am on Remembrance SundayThe Home Office believes changing religion is now standard practice among asylum seekers from countries including Iraq to game the asylum system, as converts claim they are at risk of persecution in their home countries.The  has established that after his initial application was rejected in 2014, Emad al-Swealmeen, 32, converted to Christianity on a five-week course in a bid to persuade officials to let him stay in the UK.Now, Tim Loughton MP, a senior Conservative who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee, has vowed to launch a Commons investigation. He told The Sun: There is a worrying new development where it appears certain asylum seekers are playing the religious card to avoid deportation to certain countries.This is gaming the system and something we must look into.There are very serious questions to be asked about how this from a safe country and why he was still at liberty seven years on and free to commit this atrocity.The suspect in the Liverpool Remembrance Sunday suicide bombing was able to exploit Britain\u0027s dysfunctional asylum system to remain in the country, Home Secretary Priti Patel has said.Ms Patel, on a three-day visit to Washington, said the system was a complete merry-go-round with a whole industry devoted to defending the rights of iniduals intent on causing harm.Swealmeen died in the blast in a taxi outside Liverpool Women\u0027s Hospital shortly before 11am on Remembrance Sunday.The incident has been declared a terrorist attack and the UK terror threat level has since been raised from substantial to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely rather than likely.Ms Patel told reporters on her flight to the US capital that the case showed why the Government was right to reform the asylum system.The case in Liverpool was a complete reflection of how dysfunctional, how broken, the system has been in the past, and why I want to bring changes forward, she was quoted as saying.It\u0027s a complete merry-go-round and it has been exploited. A whole sort of professional legal services industry has based itself on rights of appeal, going to the courts day-in day-out at the expense of the taxpayers through legal aid. That is effectively what we need to change.She added: These people have come to our country and abused British values, abused the values of the fabric of our country and our society.And as a result of that, there\u0027s a whole industry that thinks it\u0027s right to defend these iniduals that cause the most appalling crimes against British citizens, devastating their lives, blighting communities - and that is completely wrong.Swealmeen was a Christian convert and there was growing concern within the Home Office at the role on the Church of England in converting asylum seekers.Couple who took in terrorist say he was \u0027genuine\u0027 ChristianHowever a couple who took him in after his appeal against the asylum ruling was rejected insisted that he had been an absolutely genuine Christian with a real passion for Jesus Christ.Malcolm and Elizabeth Hitchcott said they had been contacted by Al Swealmeen in 2017 when he was desperate for somewhere to stay.Mr Hitchcott told BBC Radio Merseyside: He arrived here on April 1, 2017. He was with us then for eight months, and during that time we saw him really blossoming in regards to his Christian faith.He really had a passion about Jesus that I wish many Christians had, and he was ready to learn.He was keen on reading his Bible and every night we used to pray - my wife and him, and if there was anybody else in the house - we prayed for half an hour or so and studied the scriptures.He was absolutely genuine, as far as I could tell.

This rose to 12 to 34 per million for a second dose. Despite this, Prof Whitty and the other chief medical officers overruled the JCVI and went ahead with giving children the vaccine, but just one dose instead of the usual two. Recent analysis from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) now states the risk of myocarditis is just nine cases per million after both jabs. This newfound low level of risk likely played a role in the decision earlier this week to give 16 and 17-year-olds a second dose. However, while the Government tries to ramp up a vaccination campaign in children that appears to be showing signs of stalling, parents are likely to be more concerned than ever to learn that health officials are now saying children who have had a coronavirus infection should wait three months before getting a vaccine, to reduce myocarditis risk.Up to now, the recommendation was to only wait a month between infection and inoculation. The UKHSA said guidance had been updated as a result of emerging evidence showing a longer interval between infection and vaccination makes the chance of the inflammatory heart condition even slimmer. However, experts have been aware that prior infection with Covid may increase the risk of myocarditis following a subsequent vaccination for several months, as shown by minutes from the JCVI’s meetings in July.And while the time buffer has now been widened to at least 12 weeks, it does mean that more than one million 12 to 15-year-olds who have already been vaccinated may have got their jab within this window. Children were allowed to get a jab in September, at the exact same time as infections in secondary school children were skyrocketing. Prof Whitty authorised jabs for 12 to 15-year-olds on September 13. One month later one in every 11 children had Covid, according to the Office of National Statistics. Health officials estimate that around half of children of secondary school age have been infected, many in recent months. However, the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge suggested the true figure could be in excess of 80 per cent, with the majority occurring since September. It means that huge numbers may have unwittingly been placed at extra risk. Many parents will be unsure whether their child has had coronavirus in the last three months, which will only add to the confusion.  The back and forth and ever-changing messaging is unlikely to allay any reluctance parents have in getting their child vaccinated, especially when Covid poses so little threat to them. A report earlier this month from University College London showed coronavirus killed just six healthy children during the pandemic, while lockdowns have fuelled a timebomb of health disorders among the young.The research examining more than 3,000 deaths of under-18s in England in the year since the first lockdown found a “tiny” proportion were linked to Covid.Just 25 deaths were caused by the virus, and only six of those involved children without underlying conditions.Prof Russell Viner, a professor in adolescent health at University College London and an author of the paper on Covid cases, said: “When you look at this data together, it tells us that the indirect effects of the pandemic on children are likely to be significantly greater than the direct effects.”Experts believe vaccinating children is safe and effective, and the murky messaging of the last few months has merely been due to an abundance of caution to protect young people.But the lack of clear messaging, something the JCVI said in July was needed to ensure young adults do not “lose confidence in vaccination”, will now undoubtedly lead to parents questioning whether a vaccine is needed at all. In September, Prof Whitty insisted that vaccinating youngsters would not be a “silver bullet”, but said it was a “potentially useful tool” to help reduce the health impacts that come through educational disruption.He added: “What we’re saying is we think, on balance, the benefits both at an inidual level, and in terms of wider indirect benefits to education and through that to public health, are in favour.”Sadly, this new confusion may have just tipped the balance in the wrong direction. More from NewsPublic sexual harassment should be a crime, Stanley Johnson accuser tells Prime MinisterLord Falconer would keep prestigious second job even if Labour’s sleaze reforms were adoptedPush to get civil servants back to the office by scrapping social distancingScotland is ‘worse than it has ever been’, says a former first minister as country stalls over issue of independenceBirds fake their own death to protect nests from squattersCannabis brownie ‘triggered psychotic episode in man who ran over girlfriend’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas lockdown could plan b","story":"Will there be a Christmas lockdown and when could Plan B happen  All you need to knowBoris Johnson has refused to rule out the government’s Plan B starting in  -

The Prime Minister urged Brits to get their booster vaccine to avoid new restrictions, with all over-s and vulnerable people now able to get a third dose six months after their second one. Today he told his Cabinet that while boosters will be the main defence, “we are still not out of the woods and we cannot be complacent”. Yet despite an R rate of . to ., cases ‘running hot’ and deaths at more than , a week, he has not actually triggered England’s ‘Plan B’ - which stops well short of a lockdown. So what’s going on  Here are the main questions answered. Why is Boris Johnson worried  Boris Johnson says there is a new threat as cases are spiking in European countries including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Describing it as a “blizzard”, he said: “We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent.” Perhaps, though, the Prime Minister needs to be more concerned about the situation closer to home. UK cases have been at a high level for months and are rising again after a long fall, up .% week-on-week. There are more than , deaths a week within  days of a positive test. Scientists who spoke to the Mirror suggested domestic policy - which has pretty much no Covid restrictions in England - would be far more to blame for a rise than surges in the virus abroad. It could be that waning immunity and colder weather, forcing people to huddle indoors, are helping the virus spread.  Will there be a lockdown for Christmas   A few weeks ago Boris Johnson was asked this, and replied: “I see no evidence whatever to think that any kind of lockdown is on the cards.” But asked a similar question last night, he told a No press conference: “Clearly we cannot rule anything out. “And the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to - non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions - get the boosters. So yes, there could be a Christmas lockdown, it’s possible. But at the same time, Mr Johnson hasn’t even triggered his Plan B, let alone full lockdown. It seems likely his warnings are at least partly designed to push people into getting their booster. What is England’s Covid ‘Plan B’  A -page plan spells out a ‘Plan B’ for Englandthe virus surges. It includes bringing back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. Which settings would only be decided at the time but they’d likely include public transport, shops and supermarkets. Separately, schools have a “contingency framework” forthe virus surges locally. That includes compulsory masks in secondary classrooms. Plan B also involves forcing punters to show they’ve been fully-vaccinated using the NHS Covid pass - before entering all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. It’d also include indoor, crowded settings with  or more people outdoor, crowded settings with , or more people and any settings with , or more attendees, like Premier League football and stadium gigs. Lastly, Plan B would also see the government “consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. And ministers will “communicate clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously” - which arguably is already happening.  How is Plan B dferent from a lockdown  Plan B stops far, far short of the lockdown rules that last afflicted England in early .Those included forcing people by law to stay at home apart from for a limited number of reasons, such as going out for exercise or medical appointments. Shielding resumed, pubs and restaurants shut, takeaway pints were banned, schools were shut for months, and meetings between people from dferent households or bubbles were outlawed.Millions of workers were put on furlough, with the government paying up to % of their wages at a cost of billions of pounds per week. All these measures remain so far in reserve that the government dare not even speak their name - they do not feature in the Plan B document. When could Plan B happen  We cannot say “when” Plan B would happen exactly, and many experts have called for it to be triggered already.But we can say what the criteria for triggering it are. Key questions for triggering Plan B include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed  This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions. The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital. Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s is under way but was not as quick as ministers hoped. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme. The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Why hasn’t Boris Johnson triggered Plan B yet  The Prime Minister has effectively made a political choice that, because the rate of new cases isn’t soaring the NHS isn’t yet “overwhelmed”, , deaths a week are a price worth paying for a le without Plan B restrictions. He said this week: “We donapost see anything in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to go to Plan B. Weaposre sticking with Plan A.” Organisations including doctors’ and NHS groups have argued the health service is, in fact, close to breaking point due to the backlog of elective care. Critics argue the Prime Minister should have drawn the line in a dferent place and triggered Plan B at an earlier stage. What’s happening with booster vaccines  Booster jabs will be rolled out to people under . People aged  to -years-old are to be offered another dose of the vaccine to boost their immunity and limit transmission of the virus. Over-s and vulnerable groups could already get a booster, six months or more after their second dose. A booking can be got in the diary after a five month gap. While healthy under-s are not being offered a booster for now, the JCVI watchdog will make a decision on this when more data is available. The vaccine experts also announced new advice for  to -year-olds, who will now be told to get a second dose  weeks after their first. Will I have to get a booster for foreign travel  Quite possibly, yes. Holidaymakers can use the NHS Covid pass to prove they are fully vaccinated, allowing them to avoid quarantine rules in most countries. But the Government has been hinting that people will soon need to prove theyaposve had a booster - a third dose - to be considered fully jabbed. Boris Johnson said: I think that we will be making plans to add the booster to the NHS Covid travel pass. But again, I think what the general lesson is,anybody wants to travel, you can see that getting fully vaccinated with a booster is going to be something that will - on the whole - make your le easier in all kinds of ways including for foreign travel. So I would just say, you know,youaposre thinking about that, then this is yet another reason to get it done. The PM added: On boosters, itaposs very clear that getting three jabs - getting your booster - will become an important fact and it will make le easier for you in all sorts of ways, and we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full vaccination to take account of that.

They say Jobcentre chiefs should impose inspections on , people who made new claims in the pandemic, but whose cases had ended by January this year. It could see officials trying to claw money back from some Brits who fell on hard times a year ago. Since January the Department for Work and Pensionshas been reviewing , cases it deemed “at particular risk of fraud or error”, after relaxing identity checks during the pandemic. Some of those reviews prompted a backlash, as families were told to hold up a copy of that day’s newspaper. About % of the , cases had errors. But the cross-party PAC today claims that exercise did not go far enough - and , extra people should be subjected to retrospective checks in the next nine months. They are people who made new claims during Covid but whose claims ended by January . The committee argued the DWP had “lost a grip” of fraud and error in Universal Credit and was “taken by surprise” by the extent of fraud in the pandemic.UC overpayments due to “fraud and error” - which includes mistakes made by the DWP - rose to £.bn in  , or .% of UC spending. The DWP aims to cut this to .% but is “unable to show how it expects to achieve the reduction and does not currently have the necessary plan or resources to achieve it,” PAC said. The MPs said billions in taxpayers’ money “is almost certainly lost” - while state pensioners were underpaid for years. PAC chair Meg Hillier added: “This is a real-le waking nightmare for the huge numbers of people affected, from the most vulnerable in our society to the full-time working families who still struggle daily to make ends meet.  “The Department appears unequipped either to properly administer our labyrinthine benefits system or detect and correct years of mistakes.” It came as new figures yesterday showed one in four children in Britain are living in households hit by the £-a-week Universal Credit cut. More than . million children and young people were living in households receiving UC before the £ uplt was removed in October. There were . million people on UC on October , down , from July .Dan Paskins of Save The Children said parents are constantly worried about food and bills while kids are missing school trips - despite a Budget change to make UC more generous for workers.He said: We welcomed the Governmentaposs adjustments to Universal Credit in the Budget. But allowing some people to keep more of their income is not a replacement for a strong social safety net that protects everyone in our society. Ministers must do more to protect children across the UK from cold and hunger this winter. A government spokesperson said: “It is disappointing that the Public Accounts Committee has failed to acknowledge that in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, we prioritised supporting record numbers of genuine claimants. “Thanks to this decision, the Universal Credit system stood up to the challenge of the pandemic so people received vital financial support at their time of need. “We are now taking extensive action to ensure all claims made were genuine. “Fraud and error in the benefit system is rare, with % of benefits worth more than £bn paid correctly, and just .% of benefits being overpaid due to DWP error.” Comment MORE ON Save the ChildrenDepartment for Work and PensionsMeg HillierFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Prime Minister decided to overrule Sir Alexaposs advice, leading to the ethics chiefaposs resignation instead. Breaching the rules would normally lead to a minister resigning their post. The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has brought a judicial review of his decision, probing the legal status of the ministerial code. In written submissions, Sir James Eadie QC, for the Prime Minister, argued the Prime Minister’s decision “was a matter of judgment for him having regard to the nature of the code, his s under it, and all the circumstances of the case”.  He said the ministerial code “does not create or impose any legal duties on ministers or the Prime Minister” and is “not required by law” and its contents “not regulated by law”. But lawyers for the union, which represents senior public servants, argue Mr Johnson made a “misdirection of law” when he went against the findings of his adviser on ministerial standards in order to back Ms Patel. Tom Hickman said: “We say on any fair reading of those words the Prime Minister must have considered that where conduct which otherwise amounts to bullying is inadvertent or that the person is unaware of the distress and upset caused then that is an excuse, a reason why it does not constitute bullying. We say that is a misdirection of law.” Following the publication of his report, Ms Patel issued an “unreserved, fulsome apology” and said there were “no excuses” for what happened. The FDA’s case, being heard by Lord Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Steyn at the Royal Courts of Justice, continues.

Labour sought to force Ministers to publish details of a phone call between Health minister Lord Bethell and testing firm Randox. The firm, which has £, to the Conservative Party as well as paying the disgraced former MP Owen Paterson £, a year for legal advice, secured government testing deals at the height of the pandemic.But Health Minister Gillian Keegan said the government had been unable to locate a formal note of what was said during the call. She told MPs: The meeting [...] was a courtesy call from the minister to Randox to discuss RNA extraction kits. “That was declared on the ministerial register of calls and meetings, and we have been unable to locate a formal note of that meeting, but all the other notes that are available with regard to this - and that meeting, by the way, was after any contracts were let with Randox. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the lack of minutes from the meeting between Randox, former Tory MP Owen Paterson and former minister Lord Bethell was in breach of the ministerial code. By admitting that no minutes exist for the Randox lobbying meetings, the Government has admitted that the Government is routinely breaking the ministerial code, she said. When a minister meets an organisation or company, an official must be present to keep a record of that meeting.  The Government benches were largely deserted during the debate on Labour’s opposition motion, which sought to use a binding Parliament procedure known as a ‘humble address’ to force ministers to publish the documents. Ms Keegan said the Government were abstaining on the vote today. She said: Ministers have no role in the evaluation of Government contracts, ministers have no role in the procurement process, ministers have no role in the value of these contracts, ministers have no role in the scope of these contracts and ministers have no role in theof these contracts. From start to finish the procurement process is rightly carried out by commercial professionals and I would like to say they are governed by a strict regulatory framework... I can confirm today that no exception was made for Randox.  She added: We have behaved in exactly the same way youaposd expect from a responsible Government operating in a national crisis... The Government is not intending to vote against this Humble Address, we will review what information we hold in scope and we will define the scope... and weaposll come back to Parliament and weaposll deposit them here in the libraries of the House. Intervening, Ms Rayner said: Part of the reasons why we brought this motion to the House today was that the process wasnapost followed, actually, and there is questions about the process and how ministers were able to fast track through a VIP lane. The Government sought to clary that it has not lost the minutes, only that it cannot find them at the moment. Ms Keegan said: I just want to make it clear what I said: we have been unable to locate a formal note of the meeting. That is what I have been told so far. That doesnapost mean there isnapost one. It has been unable to locate one. But of course everything we have will be put in the House of Commons Library.

Last week the Welsh Government announced the passports will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. Anna Redfern, who owns indie picture house Cinema  Co in Swansea, told her Facebook followers the new rules were the final nail in the coffin of what it sees as the killing [of] the entertainment industry. The cinema has vowed to take a stand against the new measures claiming they arediscriminatory and unlawful , Wales Online reports.Officials say the passes are will help keep the public safe and distanced from those infected with the virus.  The pass will come into force this week and will show whether the inidual has been vaccinated and tested. Cinema  Co said it will not be implementing the nonsensical  unnecessary Covid passports.The independent Cinema is the latest venue in the city centre to announce a direct stand against the Covid passports with aposThe Perchapos also making a change last month.In a post on their social media, Cinema  Co said: Dear Customers. As an independent business, we will not be implementing the nonsensical  unnecessary Covid passports here in Swansea, Wales as they are unlawful, an infringement of our human rights  discriminate against those exercising their right to bodily autonomy. Covid passes do not give freedom, they take it away. The decision has been met with criticism from people. Sian Beth hart said: Very disappointing attitude and may well backfire. The overwhelming majority approve of and have had their vaccines, and so are unlikely to frequent a venue that is trumpeting the anti-vaxxer brigade.  However, others praised the decision and hoped it would encourage more to follow suit.The decision was made by Anna Redfern, who transformed the venue into a foods and drink location earlier this year after ongoing battles with lockdown.Now the latest Covid Pass rules have been left unwelcome by the -year-old. She said: There are businesses that are skirting around the rules, people arenapost using them appropriately and the sheer knowledge that you have to have one of these is putting people off. People donapost want to come for this reason and this is why I wanted to say something and take a stand. Businesses are living in fear of losing their livelihoods and Iaposm in the exact same position, I didnapost want to pretend to comply anymore out of fear.  Being a single mum-of-two, Anna she has lived in fear over the past year and wanted to take a stand to stop the rules spreading into other industries. If this is the hill I am going to die on - then this is the hill Iaposm going to die on, she said. Iaposm standing up for what I believe in, it is not fair by any stretch of the imagination - it is killing the entertainment industry and hospitality is even next - it says so in the rules. Describing the new rules as discriminatory, Anna argued that her business has been repeatedly hit over the past year. They keep changing the goal posts, they keep putting up more obstacles and I have a right to earn a living, it puts food on my kids table and Iaposm a single mum, dealing with all this has been extremely challenging. Theres a huge discrimination element to these passes and people arenapost able to access their rights, weaposre in  and weaposre discriminating against those who have chosen to exercise bodily autonomy It just doesnapost fit right with me, people from all walks of le are welcome at Cinema  Co.

He bravely served in the Falklands war, working so hard to make sure the UK could continue colonising parts of the world that he OVERDOSED on adrenaline, leaving him unable to sweat. He possesses a flawless memory and can recall which high-street pizza chain he was at on any day during his letime. And, he admirably stepped down from royal duties and surrendered his £, a year salary back to taxpayers. Itaposs the PR spin the Royal Family could only hope for. But unfortunately for them, the Duke of York is a ticking time bomb that could bring down the Firm altogether.  Aside from the explosive sexual abuse allegations from over the pond - which heaposs strenuously denied and will continue to do so in a New York court - and the occasional sleepover with the worldaposs most notorious paedophile, Andrew has made headlines once again for all the wrong reasons.Last night it was claimed the -year-old royal was bailed out by a major Tory donor back in . A staggering £.million was transferred to Prince Andrew to pay off a loan from an offshore bank owned by the donor’s family - leading to calls from former minister Norman Baker for a parliamentary probe into the royal’s relationship with property tycoon David Rowland and Banque Havilland. Itaposs worth noting that Andrew was still an acting royal at this point, and was raking in more than £, a month for gallivanting around the world.  Just like every other scandal Randy Andy gets himself knotted into, this no doubt will soon get swept under the carpet. But attitudes towards the monarchy are changing. More people, particularly young Brits, are turning away from tradition and supporting the idea of an elected head of state. So, will Andrewaposs antics slowly chip away at his dear motheraposs popularity too  Outrage already splattered over social media when it was alleged the Queen was paying for Andrewaposs legal fees . People werenapost much happier when it was reported Mummy also wanted Andrew to keep his military titles. Itaposs a hard decision - choosing between your son and your job - but the Queen needs to renounce sleazy Andrew before the people renounce her.

The youngster was assaulted in her own home by Eric Stevenson, , who has been jailed for  years. Despite Stevenson being trapped by DNA evidence, locals in the girlaposs neighbourhood took sides with him and she was forced to moved away as a result. In a harrowing statement she said she is now too terried to sleep at night in her new home, and has lost friends following her ordeal. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spoke out as Stevenson, from Middleton, near Rochdale, Greater Manchester was jailed. She said: “I have decided to speak so my abuser knows exactly how he made me feel because Iaposm sure he could see it in my eyes.  I have been scared to open up on my feelings but it was thought it might help give me closure and look forward. aposaposI have lost my friends as everyone around me was forced to take sides - and nobody chose me. I still feel so alone. I hate myself for feeling vulnerable and when I think about what happened to me, I feel sick and ashamed. aposaposI do not want to be a girl who has been abused. I want to be a normal -year-old girl who goes out with their friends but now I am too afraid. I am afraid of the dark and I am scared to leave the house. aposaposWhen I do, I look behind me every ten or so seconds. No one understands. Sometimes, I will have good days then something little happens like my brother or sister coming into my room without knocking and I get triggered. aposaposMy mum bought me a night light which I keep on because I’m afraid of the dark. This has helped but I still struggle to sleep some nights as I go over what has happened to me. I feel like I’m in a nightmare when I’m both awake and asleep. aposaposI’ve been made to feel worthless, angry, sad and hurt. I have lost everything. I am so alone with my thoughts that I have thought about ending things. I know that isn’t the way, I just want the pain to stop.” The investigation began in October  after the girl spoke to a teacher at her school and told her she had had raped the previous weekend. Jonathan Savage prosecuting said: aposaposThe defendant was interviewed by police officers and asked to comment on the allegations the complainant had made but denied he had done anything to her. aposaposBut the clothing she had been wearing over the course of the previous weekend was seized from her and this included the shorts she had been wearing. aposaposWhen the shorts were analysed, DNA was found on the inside of the front of the shorts and a trace of the defendant’s DNA was found on them.aposapos Stevenson who joined his we at the church after the attack, denied rape and assault but was convicted after a trial at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. In mitigation defence counsel William Donnelly said: “This defendant is a man who has reached his mid s and who has signicant health problems. aposaposHe is a man of no previous convictions and a sentence of imprisonment will hit him hard and have lasting effects on him and his le.aposapos Sentencing Judge Paul Lawton told Stevenson: “What you did to her was quite appalling. It happened in her home, which she should have regarded as an entirely safe fair haven. As a consequence, she was compelled to leave in the days after what happened. “What you did to her will have caused incalculable damage for the rest of her le. We heard a heartfelt victim personal statement from her. She now faces a long term psychological battle as a result of your actions. She was particularly vulnerable and this was planned sexual abuse in the absence of your we.” Following his release from jail Stevenson will be on licence for an extra two years under the terms of an extended sentence.

Late-night emails, client WhatsApps, the news, a Twitter notication, FitBit… it didn’t matter what it was. What mattered is that I was immediately available or I’d miss something transformative, I was sure of it. I’d sit at dinner, discussing a friend’s hilariously bad date, missing cues to laugh as I was too busy urging myself not to glance down at my lit up screen. I’d sit at my desk, unable to focus, being pulled out of concentration by the incessant glow. I had reached such a heightened level of contact with the outside world that I didn’t even notice how badly I needed to disconnect. One day, after a long, hard think about this habit, I did something I never thought would actually stick: I turned every single notication off.You’d think I’d be the last person on earth to actually manage this, or I certainly did anyway. I had founded amarketing agencyin the year prior. I had clients, a small team, umpteen social media accounts to manage, inquiring journalists, potential business popping up and I really believed this demanded me to be non-negotiably on, all the time. Would you ever go cold turkey on your phone notications  Have your say in the comments below Fast forward six months, I now find it incredibly odd to imagine my phone holding that much power over me. I’ve turned off every single notication, I don’t open the email app out-of-hours, and I’ve turned off the banner and badge alerts for most apps too. Nothing, except urgent phone calls, has lit up my phone for over half a year. The first two weeks were uncomfortably dficult. When you get a notication, it triggers a dopamine rush, and my own brain was addicted to this “reward”, craving the habit-based behaviour. I felt anxious for a while, semi-desperately telling everyone about it, making sure they knew to call they needed me.After that  Peace. There’s been a million ways this has benefited me in every aspect of my le but perhaps most importantly, I am able to be present, no matter where I am. Whether it’s getting my head down to plan a brand launch strategy or at the dinner table discussing future travel plans. Either way, I am finally living in the moment. People rarely call, and this always surprises me. Both my colleagues and I have realised that we believe everything is urgent, until we’re forced to decideit’s worth interrupting someone... and it often turns out, it’s just not. Clients follow the same logic. I’m a big fan of that. I can’t think of one single moment or opportunity I have missed because of this. Everyone, both professionally and personally, has better boundaries with me now. Our clients rarely WhatsApp, butand when they do, I still won’t reply out of working hours, unless itaposs an emergency - which is almost never. My friends know I’ll reply when I can , but they also know when I’m with them, I’m now both physically and mentally present. As a society, we have a painful and damaging relationship with technology, and an ever-growing notion that with all this wonderful tech, we should be far more connected than ever before. It’s undeniable that we’re privileged to have this access. But at the same time, being instantly available to everyone and anything is simply not healthy.My current wellbeing is testament to that. I used to feel anxious and overwhelmed, and while this might not be the only change I made to lessen that, it’s certainly one of the biggest. It’s liberating. I’ve learnt that you don’t ever need to apologise for being unavailable. You don’t need to give anyone that instant access to you. You don’t need to be actively busy to not respond - you’re entitled to be actively not-busy and still unavailable. Those boundaries are healthy and should become society’s norm. And I truly believe,you challenge yourself to three weeks, this will become your norm too.

Recently, sheaposs taken on more duties and patronages and has spoken out on powerful issues such as child development in the early years and addiction.Signicantly, she also took the centre spot in the middle of the Duchess of Cornwall and Countess of Wessex on the balcony as they watched the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph this year. Here we look at how Kate is appearing to be a Queen in waiting... We and mother One way in which Kate has become a power player in the royal family is her role as we of a future king and mother to a future king. And according to royal expert Camilla Tominey, this makes her arguably the most powerful person in the royal family. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.In a video for the , she said: When it comes to their generation, you could say [Kate and Prince William] are ruling the royal roost. Meanwhile, according to royal author Katie Nicholl, there are t wo roles for a future Queen, and Kate has already fulfilled one.She told the documentary Kate: The Making of a Modern Queen: One is to produce heirs, which she has done and one is to learn to one day become Queen. More duties With the death of the Duke of Edinburgh and the elderly Queen scaling back her engagements, Kate has appeared to step up and take on more responsibility and work as she prepares to become consort. Meanwhile, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepping down from the royal family has also thrust Kate into the spotlight more.One Palace staffer previously said: “Without a doubt, we are in a period of change. Arguably change at the top, with the Queen handing over more responsibilities to the Prince of Wales and, of course, William. What does that mean for Kate “It means she will be even more front and centre, and what you’ve seen over the past year or two is that she definitely has grown in confidence in order to do that. “With the Duke and Duchess of Sussex out of the picture, and never likely to , one would think this is their time. “At one stage they may have thought that they were being over-burdened but in reality they have a clear run. “They can work on the projects they want to and which they feel can make the most impact. But they can also carry on the work of the monarchy in their own way, upholding the values of those who came before them while making it relevant for a new generation. It’s going to be a very exciting time.” Growing confidence  As Kate takes on more and more engagements, experts have noted her growing with confidence.And at the weekendaposs Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, it was notable she stood in the middle with Camilla and Sophie on either side of her as they watched the service from a balcony.And according to body language expert Judi James, she very much looked like the highest-ranking woman in the group. She told the Express : With Camilla next in line to the role of Queen consort it might have been expected for her to take that middle position between the two younger women.“Eventhere’s no actual protocol the non-verbal message is rather emphatic and by standing to one side like this it gives the impression that Kate is very much the Queen’s stand-in at this event. “Kate’s height and her body language give her a very natural look of royal high status and the way she rotates to speak to Sophie and Camilla in turns adds to this impression of being female alpha in the group. Family peacemaker  However, it appears that as well as stepping up when it comes to duties, Kate has also stepped in to help with family matters.Experts have hailed her increasing role as a peacemaker between the Firm and the Sussexes, following the latteraposs fractious move to America and a series of explosive interviews criticising the royals.Kateaposs skilful handling of the crisis was on full display at Prince Philipaposs funeral in April, as she was seen walking with feuding brothers Prince William and Prince Harry before quietly stepping away to allow them a rare chance to talk.  Insiders have even suggested she is stepping into the Duke of Edinburghaposs shoes as the family aposconfidanteapos.In an interview on  Minutes Australia, expert Katie Nicholl suggested that Kate was now best positioned to take up the Dukeaposs mantle.I think Kate is the glue. In the same way that the Duke of Edinburgh was always the one who would help resolve family issues, she said. He was the patriarch of the family. She added: I see Kate stepping into that role. Trying to keep things together. Meanwhile, writing in the Sunday aposs Stella magazine, Camilla Tominey said the mum-of-three was fast becoming recognised for how regal an operator she is. She wrote: Her skilful handling of royal crises in recent months suggests that she is fast emerging as the jewel in the monarchyaposs crown.

However the -week rule will lead to signicant delays in rolling out the vaccine programme among children.Around half of school children have had Covid- and yesterday’s REACT- study showed one in  pupils were infected between October  and November .  The current advice for older people and for people at high risk of Covid- - including those aged  and over - is that they should wait four weeks between Covid infection and having a dose of vaccine. But officials said this should be extended to  weeks in lower-risk children between  and . The guidance comes amid high infection rates among younger age groups.

Hero taxi driver David Perry had a miracle escape after a home-made device strapped to his passenger Emad Jamil Al Swealmeen - who changed his name to Enzo Almeni - exploded in the back of his cab outside the hospital on Sunday.Chilling shop CCTV footage has been published by the Liverpool Echo showing the final journey of Almeni on his way to sow terror at the hospital.This comes after a source close to the driver told the Mirror the bomber only spoke two words - “Women’s hospital” - after he was picked up for the seven minute car journey shortly before am on Remembrance Sunday.  He didn’t say another word all the way there. The driver was not aware of anything” said the source. He said David was briefly knocked out by the force of the blast, which blew out his windscreen and sent shards of glass and metal spiralling in the air. The source added: “He woke up leaning on the steering wheel. He was trapped and then saw flames coming through the two seats. “He couldn’t get his seatbelt off so had to climb out of it.”  David was able to scramble free seconds before his car was engulfed by flames with Almeni still inside. His we said later her husband was saved by “ angels”. The Liverpool Echo learned that Mr Perryaposs taxi travelled along Lodge Lane on its way to the Crown Street site, and was captured by cameras at The Green Mountain Food Store, by the junction with Tagus Street. Manager Naz Al-Asadi, , told them: The police came in around pm yesterday, they said to me can we check the CCTV. I said yes, we should work together as this is something not good at all, this is very, very bad. They knew the time and they took a copy. It is very horrible, very very bad. I just want to know what was going on with this guy, it is not normal.  Four men arrested in relation to the explosion outside the Womenaposs Hospital in Liverpool on Sunday  November have now been released from custody following interview. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, said in an update on Monday: Following interviews with the arrested men, we are satisfied with the accounts they have provided and they have been released from police custody. The investigation continues to move at a fast pace with investigative teams working throughout the night. We have made signicant progress since Sunday morning and have a much greater understanding of the component parts of the device, how they were obtained and how the parts are likely to have been assembled. We have also recovered important evidence from the address at Rutland Avenue which is becoming central to the investigation.  There is a considerable way to go to understand how this incident was planned, prepared for and how it happened. We are gaining a better understanding by the hour but it is likely to be some time, perhaps many weeks until we are confident on our understanding of what has taken place. In the meantime, we have considerable resources and staff deployed to understand how this device was built and whoanyone  was involved. If the evidence takes us to the involvement of others, further arrests will quickly take place. Anyone who has any information should call on    quoting Liverpool Womens Hospital incident.

Liam and Stephanie, , were driving into Liverpool city centre when he decided to stop off at the hospital and say hello to his old colleagues. Liam said: I thought Iaposll just swing by and say hello to everyone. I pulled up and said I should only be five or  minutes and told for her to wait .  I walked in and I was having a chat with my old colleague. But as I was getting ready to leave, I just heard this explosion - this loud bang. At first I thought it could have been a car crash but I thought thataposs awfully loud for a car crash. I ran out and saw the car had exploded. My first thought was just to grab my girlfriend and get her close to the building or inside so sheaposs out of the way. I never saw the driver get out so I ran to the driveraposs side of the car to seehe was still in there, oranyone  was still in there. Then I saw the driverwho was in quite an awful state standing with the security guard in the ambulance bay. I went back to the car because I was askinganyone  in the car, but I donapost think they quite understood what I was saying because everyone was in shock. I ran back to check and thataposs when I saw the man in the car. He was on fire. Liam said he was unable to say whether the passenger, since identied as Emad Al Swealmeen, was still alive at this point. Liam said: I just seen him and the top half of his body through the rear door. I think the door had been blown off, I canapost really recall. But I remember it being slightly open.  I didnapost want to injure myself but I was looking at the best way to get him out of the car. I initially went close to seeI could grab him because the flames werenapost as big at that point. As I got close the flames engulfed him and thataposs when I ran to go and get a fire extinguisher and then the security came out with one. CCTV footage shows the car becoming engulfed in flames moments after its driver David Perry had escaped the vehicle. Several people approach the vehicle following the blast, including one person who attempted unsuccessfully to put the flames out with a fire extinguisher.  Liam said: I thought, aposOh s**tapos because the car next to mine had started to go on fire. I thoughtmy car goes up it will take the whole hospital so I thought Iaposll try and move it. My ex-colleague shouted to me, aposWhat are you doing you f***g idiot, get out of the car, itaposs not worth it.apos  I then I realised, what am I doing in this car, my leaposs not worth it so I just got out. Emergency services arrived and put out the flames and police secured the car park and front entrance of the hospital. Liam and Stephanie, who lives in St Helens, were sat in the foyer of the hospital waiting for police to take a statement. This, he said, took a couple of hours because officers were trying to contain the situation and make sure the hospital was still accessible to the public.  Since the bombing, a Gofundme page has been set up to raise money for four people, including Liam, who were caught up in the bomb attack outside the hospital.If you would like to make a donation, click here. Liam said:was quite shaken up. I was alright for about an hour - it hadnapost really hit me. We didnapost know it was a terrorist incident at the time. I just thoughtthat had been any worse I could have lost her - then it started to really upset me, how it could have been a lot dferent. After finding out the next day that the explosion was now being treated as an act of terrorism, Liam said he and his girlfriend were shocked by the news. Since the bombing, Liam said that police and intelligence services have been in regular contact. He added: We still canapost believe itaposs real. My girlfriend is still suffering with her ears a lot because she was in the car.  The Liverpool bomber had been buying bomb components since at least April, police have revealed. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said that Iraq-born Emad Al Swealmeen had rented a property in Liverpool seven months ago and had started making relevant purchases for his homemade bomb at least since that time. On Wednesday afternoon, a Royal Logistics Corp bomb disposal vehicle arrived at Boaler Street along with a fire engine after a police cordon in nearby Sutclfe Street - where officers believe Al Swealmeen previously lived - was extended and residents living within it were told they could nothome. Police said this was to allow officers to make an assessment of materials found in a property that weaposve been searching, adding: This is only as a precaution. Searches have also been carried out at a property in Rutland Avenue that had been rented by Al Swealmeen since April.  In an update issued earlier in the day, Mr Jackson said: A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time. We have now traced a next of kin for Al Swealmeen who has informed us that he was born in Iraq. He also said that the -year-old asylum seeker had suffered from periods of mental illness that will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand.

Holly Higgins told bosses she wouldnapost get the Covid- vaccine but they said she either had to back down or lose her job.The -year-old, a healthcare assistant at Appleton Manor in Bredbury, Manchester, for almost four years, says she should have been medically exempt following the announcement of the mandate.She submitted proof of ious medical issues to her employees before the government deadline, theManchester Evening News reports.But her pleas fell on deaf ears - and she is now out of work with Christmas fast approaching.The parent believes working through the pandemic led to her developing a number of health problems and she wants to take the matter further.  She said: “I’ve had my heart ripped out - I’ve had to leave the residents Iaposve looked after for three and a half years. I feel so worthless. “I feel like we weren’t valued at all throughout the pandemic. “And now to be last year’s heroes and this year’s unemployed – itaposs totally unfair.” She believes she now has asthma and allergies after working as the pandemic raged - issues she never suffered from previously. Holly, who also suffers with anxiety, says being allowed exemption from the vaccine was denied. She continued: “I had a meeting in August as I was the one who wasn’t vaccinated. I suffer from anxiety so became distressed in the meeting and they didn’t care. “They told meI didn’t have the vaccine, I would be dismissed.

I haven’t signed anything in my contract to say I’d have a vaccine. “I’ve refused the flu jab every time I’ve been there. I just don’t have any injections so Iaposm not going to make an exception for Covid. Whataposs the point when you can still catch it. “A vaccine doesn’t make you the person you are today. It’s whether you care or you don’t. “Why it’s a level of requirement now – it’s bonkers.” A spokesperson for HC-One, who run Appleton Manor, said: “Our purpose is to be The Kind Care Company, supporting our residents to lead their best le with care from our experienced and passionate Colleagues. Our homes need to be safe and open to visiting so that residents and their families can come together as they wish. “We can’t miss any opportunity to make this happen, which is why we announced in July that the Covid- vaccine would be a condition of employment for all HC-One employees across the nations. This was the responsible step for us to take to protect the people we care for, as well as our colleagues, as the evidence clearly shows that vaccination cuts transmission and substantially reduces the risk of hospitalisation.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

The mum-of-two thinks the totaposs bizarre obsession comes from her guzzling large amounts of cheese during pregnancy. And now Maddy says she is forced to grate cheese over vegetables. If she didnapost, the toddler wouldnapost eat anything healthy. But Harriet is the youngest of a family of cheese lovers, who claim to have been the number one purchaser of the dairy delight from Sainsburyaposs in Southampton.The exasperated mum-of-two refuses to give up on her daughteraposs extremely restrictive diet and says she will continue to explore dferent foods with the fussy tot. Maddy, from Shirley, Southampton, said: She will eat everythingitaposs cheese and nothing , sheaposs a pain. But itaposs not like she likes all kinds of cheese - basically anything cheddar or cheddar-form, thataposs it! She says aposI love cheese mummy, I want cheese mummy, please can I have cheese mummyapos - that sort of thing all the time, and cheese is aposyummyapos and anything  is aposyuckyapos. Itaposs so hard to feed her, sheaposs a stubborn little one. We have basically had every meal in the world involving cheese. I put other things on her plate all the time so that she can try them and investigate but itaposs always a no and the dog ends up eating most of it. I absolutely love cheese as well. Weaposre a very cheesy family, apart from my son who hates it, so we buy at least four blocks of cheese a week. On the Nectar app for Sainsburys you can look at what your top purchases are for and from that I know that at one point we were the top purchaser of cheese in Southampton. The mum says her toddleraposs typical meals include cheese on toast, cheese omelettes and cheesy pasta, while her favourite cheesy snacks are cheese and crackers, Wotsits, Quavers and Cheese Strings. Meanwhile any non-cheese food items usually end up being thrown to the family dog Dexter, a seven-year-old Spaniel, after Harriet refuses to eat them. Maddy suspects that her diet during pregnancy may have influenced her daughteraposs aposobsessionapos with cheese, as she suffered from gestational diabetes and was advised to eat more cheese. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy because the body canapost produce enough insulinto meet the extra demands of pregnancy.The NHS advises women who suffer from the condition to eat three portions of calcium-rich foods, such as cheese, daily - leading Maddy to believe this is when her daughter got a taste for cheddar. Maddy, who is the founder of a free parenting advice app called aposParenthoodapos, said: Itaposs weird because I had gestational diabetes when I was pregnant so I ate lots of cheese and now Iaposm wondering whether or not it could be connected. With gestational diabetes you have to eat high fat to keep your blood sugars low and cheese is one of the things they suggest. Cheese was all I ate when I was pregnant so maybe I got her into that habit. When we were doing baby-led weaning and putting food in front of her she loved these really tiny cheese cubes and she went for those over everything . Anything  you put in front of her she would turn her nose up at, she doesnapost want to eat it. Despite the stresses of trying to feed their extremely picky child, the parents say they havenapost given up entirely and will continue to offer little Harriet a iety of nutrient rich foods in the hopes of finding more things she will eat. Although so far her exclusive love of cheese has prevailed and the dog continues to enjoy an array of tit-bits. Maddy said: We try very hard to mix it up a bit so she might have macaroni cheese or vegetables with cheese on, but we literally have to grate cheese over everything. Itaposs pretty dficult but we havenapost given up completely. We are still putting fruit on her plate. We do try but most things she turns her nose up at. I donapost think sheaposs necessarily scared of other foods but she just has such an affection for cheese that it just comes first.

The Prince of Wales was asked about his mother’s health during an engagement in Amman, Jordan, where he is on tour with the Duchess of Cornwall this week. The Queen’s unexpected absence from the Remembrance Day ­service sparked concerns, but he reassured the public there is nothing to read into her withdrawal. He quipped about le being a challenge at his age - let alone when you are . The Queen has been pictured standing and smiling today three days after missing the Remembrance Sunday service.  She appeared today at Windsor Castle to bid farewell to the outgoing armed forces chief, her first public in person engagement since October .

Her Majesty has been resting under doctors’ orders since spending the night in hospital on October , after undergoing “preliminary investigations” for an unknown condition.  Today she told General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, it was easier to continue once you get into the top military job as she carried out her first official engagements since missing the Remembrance Sunday service. The head-of-state, the nationaposs longest reigning sovereign and has herself been in the principal royal role of monarch for nearly  years, pledging her whole le to royal service. Buckingham Palace has said the Queen has been in good spirits despite taking a back step from public duties for the last few weeks and today she smiled and chatted to General Sir Nick.  After hearing the military man had been in the post for the second longest in history, the Queen remarked: I supposeyou get into that job, you know, it is easier to continue, isnapost it really The monarch, who was without her walking stick, was pictured standing in the castleaposs Oak Room, having pulled out of attending the Cenotaph ceremony three days ago due to a sprained back. Dressed in a green, orange and white floral dress and wearing a string of pearls, the Queen, who is head of the Armed Forces, smiled and shook hands with Gen Sir Nick as they began chatting.  He told the Queen he had been in the post for eight years, with the Queen remarking it was rather sad he was leaving, adding: Itaposs a long time. Gen Sir Nick discussed the Duke of Edinburghaposs late uncle, saying: It is a long time. In fact, the only person who has done longer Iaposm told is Lord Mountbatten... so I am quite surprised by all that. The Queen chuckled and replied: Oh really  Oh   She added: I supposeyou get into that job, you know, it is easier to continue, isnapost it really  Gen Sir Nick said: I think thataposs right. Although I have to say I think the time comes when itaposs ready to move on. After chatting together standing up, the pair went on to sit in nearby chairs to continue their conversation.

But respite could be available for those who qualy for an interest free loanA little known scheme for Universal Credit claimants could ease some money worries, with interest free loans of up to £, Image: PAByTom HaynesKate BuckNews Reporter:,  Nov | commentsChristmas is fast approaching, bringing with it a raft of money worries for many families about how they will cope financially with the festive season.But a little known scheme for Universal Credit claimants could ease some money worries, with interest free loans of up to £, for those who are waiting for their first payment to come through. The loan can also be accessed by those who need more money due to a sudden change in circumstances, like having a baby, MyLondon reports. Universal Credit claimants are facing a tougher time than ever after the temporary uplt given during lockdown was snatched away in October, just as increases in energy and food costs starting biting at peopleaposs pockets.  Those making a claim for Universal Credit face a five-week wait for the money, which can leave some struggling for cash to pay bills. The advance payment is currently being offered via the Department for Work and Pensions , which will allow claimants to borrow money then pay it back in installments. The loans are interest free - and the amount claimants can get depends on how much Universal Credit they are entitled to. The maximum amount claimants can borrow is currently £,. Claimants can as for up to  per cent of the amount but can also ask for less.  Borrowed money should be with claimants within three days of making a claim and will have to make the money last five weeks until the UC payment comes through. The money deducted from your next UC payment can be worked out by iding the full cost by Claimants who get a job and stop claiming UC will still have to repay the loan. Those wishing to make a claim should apply through JobCentre   . Applications made because of a change in circumstance should be done over the phone. Applicants will need to explain their reasons for needing the loan - and wonapost get the payment automatically. They will also need to be able to prove that they can pay back the cash, and agree a rate at which the loan will be repaid. Those struggling to repay an advance will be able to pause a repayment for up to three months . Applicants are advised to contact their work coach or ask online for further assistance.

But while this treat might feel like heaven, believe me, itaposs Hell working there. Whether it’s the medley of teenage lads shouting “Here comes Fatty” to me as they scoff a p cheeseburger, or the experience of witnessing a grown man rip off a Covid- protection window due to a lack of milkshakes, my six years at McDonalds have been nothing short of a flurry. After applying fresh out of high school , McDonald’s flexible hours and healthy rate of pay was extremely attractive to a skint first-year college student. And while most worry the lack of experience would be the issue with younger staff members, it’s the drama you’ve got to watch out for.  Once you’re past the three-month probation - during which most existing staff members refuse to acknowledge your existence - every fresh cohort brings a brand-new tier to Macciesapos ever growing political chain. However, the real initiation isn’t complete without the obligatory mid-sht breakdown. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve caught crying in the freezer, the stock room, even behind the bins. It’s a rite of passage for new staff members. Keeping a brave face is at least  percent of the job. From the Friday stampede of orders , to shovelling the remnants of half-chewed chicken nuggets from abandoned trays into the bin, and even having abuse hurledfor receiving cold food “after waiting for half an hour” always half an hour.It’s all just a part of the job.  That’s not to say every customer is rude, though. But there are the ones who test patience in a busy Drive-Thru. Firstly, nothing is LESS funny than when people try and order a Wicked Zinger Box Meal. Secondly, on behalf of every McDonald’s worker, we don’t serve mayonnaise. I don’t know why we don’t serve mayonnaise I don’t know IF we will ever serve mayonnaise and “speaking to the manager” about the lack of mayonnaise certainly isn’t going to solve anything. Thirdly, we can hear and see everything you do while you’re waiting to give your order by the Drive-Thru speakers. I can’t tell you how many solo renditions of cringe ‘s pop hits I’ve heard over the years. Alas, the serenade of freshly driving teens and those who queue for half an hour for the sake of a bottle of waterblocks out the eight hours of incessant beeping machines. *The writeraposs name has been changed.

The mum-of-four also claims her now ex-husband cheated on her with at least  dferent woman throughout the duration of their marriage and even had two children with two dferent women while married to Hailey. Hailey, who works in administration said: I heard rumours that my friend was pregnant and homeless, so I reached out to her. I felt the need to help her. We are all charismatic people, so we all had that nature to be charismatic around each other and make jokes. I didnapost see anything there. I was very naive so I just didnapost think it would be possible for someone to do that. We had just got home from the hospital and I was changing the baby when she turned her neck the birth defect popped out. When theyaposre babies it is really hard to see, and I wasnapost looking for it. I felt it and was like aposokapos, this shock came over me. When I found out my friend was standing next to me, I looked at her and you could just tell. She couldnapost say anything, she just dropped her head and looked to the floor, and I just knew.  There were no words that were said, I just knew. I was in a lot of shock in the beginning I couldnapost even process what had happened, it was almost like a stage of grief. Like you have your shock, your anger and you come to the conclusion that this is actually real le, this is actually happening. Hailey said she was excited to help her best friend - who she does not wish to name - give birth and even helped deliver the baby and give them their first bath. She said: In the hospital before I found out, I stepped into that father figure role. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I was there for her every step of the way. Even in the hospital I wore the daddy wrist band, when she got her epidural, she laid on me. I actually gave the baby her first bath. After the heartbreaking ordeal, Hailey has found forgiveness within herself and plans on continuing her friendship with the friend and having a cordial relationship with her ex-husband for the sake of her children. She explained: For me, I was in a state of shock for a little bit. I walked outside when I first found out and just prayed. I kept hearing the words over and over in my head, aposbigger pictureapos. For me that meant, stop with your tunnel vision.  Now we have this innocent child who had no say in this whole situation, you have someone who doesnapost have anywhere to go, who has no family, weaposre not going to kick them to the streets. I kept thinking of my kids, at the end of the day that is their blood sibling and Iaposm not going to be the one who causes harm to that child. So, she ended up staying with us. Hailey, who shared her story on TikTok with her original video gaining over .million views, opened up about some of the comments sheaposs been receiving She said: Iaposve had one or two comments who are obviously men and narcissistic who said aposwellyou took care of your man, he wouldnapost have cheatedapos. A lot of the comments though have been in support of me but thereaposs been some heat towards my friend which I try to shut down as soon as possible because that was not my goal. Itaposs got . million views now and has just blown up. Itaposs huge for everyone to know that I found forgiveness for myself. Iaposve had to find forgiveness for myself and for the children. Thataposs the main point, you can walk through anything in le, and you can find forgiveness it just heals you from the inside out. When you donapost forgive yourself itaposs like you drinking poison and wanting them to die. When I forgive for myself, it means Iaposm forgiving because I canapost stay sick anymore.

One pet owner recently got rather fed up with cleaning muddy paw prints off the floor after her dog, Milo, had been out for a walk. So she decided to take matters into her own hands and find a solution to the problem.TikToker Tina Marie @secondwele , who regularly vlogs about her work fostering rescue dogs, decided to purchase a pair of rain boots for her dog Milo, as a means of stopping him from treading mud into the house.In Tina’s own words, ‘it didn’t go well’, with sweet, Milo left completely baffled by his sensible new footwear.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. In a video that has been shared nearly , times in a matter of days, Milo can be seen snfing curiously at the little blue boots before letting Tina pop them on his paws.The good boy initially looks quite relaxed as he lies about on the floor examining his new accessories. But all that changes when Tina tells him it’s time for a walk, a siren call no dog can resist. As Milo scrambles up on his four paws ready for adventures, it becomes abundantly clear that he’s completely bewildered by the boots.  Calling to mind the scene from Bambi when the ungainly baby deer attempts to walk on ice, Milo can be seen stomping this way and that, frequently checking up on his back paws asto make sure they hadn’t wandered off somewhere. Thousands of people liked and commented on the amusing clip, with one writing: He forgot how to dog. Another said: I laughed soo hard! Best thing Iaposve seen all WEEK! Thanks for the smile. A third replied: We have some for hiking. Takes about five minutes for my dog to adjust. We laugh every time. While someone  added: This is hilarious. Thereaposs a portable paw washer on Amazon that Milo might like more lol. Others compared it to themselves while trying to walk in high heels. Updating amused followers in the comments section, Tina revealed: “Thankfully, he quickly forgave me once I took them off and rewarded him with treats for being a good boy!”In a follow-up TikTok, this time aptly accompanied by Nancy Sinatra’s These Boots Are Made For Walking, Tina explained that, although she felt Milo might have gotten used to the boots in time, she didn’t ‘have the heart to put them back on him’.It doesn’t look likely that Milo will be stepping out in his boots anytime soon, however, plenty of pet owners do find that such shoes are a great way to protect their dogs’ paws in the chilly winter months, shielding their pads from ice and grit.Older dogs in particular, who often drag their paws while out on walks, may well benefit from the additional cushioning and support, as per My Busy Dog, as might those with hip issues.

The parents travelled to Ukraine in August  after their baby was born to a surrogate mother. But for reasons unknown, the pair ed to their home country of Italy shortly after and left the new born behind, in the care of her nanny. While they promised tothey never came back to get her and so the little girl, now  months old, was cared for by the nanny who raised her as her own daughter. Realising the parents might notand worried about the legal repercussions, the nanny contacted the Italian consulate to report that she could no longer afford to raise the child. Italian authorities at the Juvenile Prosecutor’s Office were able to track down the parents and confirm that the couple did not intend to take their daughter back. Now, a court has determined that the little girl should be put up for adoption, leaving the nanny devastated that she will have to give her up. Ukraine is among a handful of countries in which surrogacy is commercial and legal and the country offers a systematic and large-scale provision of surrogate services to the world. A shocking video last year showed almost  surrogate babies crammed in a dormitory at a hotel in Kiev as the lockdown stopped their parents from collecting them.The parents from the UK, USA, Italy, Spain, France, Israel, Germany, China, Mexico, Romania and other countries had paid between £, and £, for services from an organisation that assisted them with starting families. But due to the pandemic causing countries to close their borders, the baby were being cared for by staff at a so-called aposbaby factoryapos. Last week, the Service for International Police Cooperationcoordinated with the Italian Consulate in the Ukrainian capital to organise for the baby to be taken to Italy and put up for adoption. A team that consisted of officials from the Italian Red Cross, including a paediatrician and volunteer nurse, travelled to Ukraine to fly the girl to Italy. The child was flown to Malpensa, on November  where she is currently being cared for by a foster family while the adoption process is underway. Carolina Casini, a volunteer pediatrician of the Italian Red Cross, told the court that the baby had slept for the entire duration of the trip in her arms. Although the team had been afraid of finding her in poor condition and emotionally deprived, they found that the little girl was in good condition and that the nanny who looked after her until yesterday loved her very much and took great care of her.”  The nanny was reported to have been heartbroken by the news and handed over pictures for the girl’s new parents so she will see them when she is grown up. The last recommendation from the nanny to the inspector who took the child back to Italy was: “Sheaposll eat the banana, give her a whole one.” It is unclear whether the surrogate parents will face prosecution for allegedly abandoning their baby daughter in Ukraine.

Badesim Kubak, who is from Turkey but now lives New York, said she wanted her legs waxed for a concert, as her culture frowns on shaving. But what should have been an easy appointment caused her to need three weeks of medical treatments for the burns left by the wax. In a TikTok she wrote: Starting with waxing my legs, itaposs painful but I can take it. While the lady is applying the wax to my inner thighs, the lid of the applicator comes off and boiling wax spills all over between my legs. She added the wax spilled just inches from her vagina, and she started screaming and crying from the excruciating pain. But instead of stopping the treatment to seeshe was ok, or check what she had done, Badesim claims the beautician told her she was making a big deal out of it, and told her everything was ok. She rips the wax off me to stop it from burning my skin, while telling me it is seriously nothing, Badesim continued. aposShe puts MOISTURISER and PAPER TOWELS on my burn and tells me she is done. I am super embarrassed that everyone  in the salon heard me scream and cry.apos Without knowing what  to do, Badesim paid full price for her botched wax and went back to school, where a nurse tried to help as best they could. But the following morning it became clear the situation was more serious than initially thought, and was far more serious than the beautician said it would be. Next morning I wake up with insane pain, my leg is still wrapped up, she continued. My parents take me to my uncle who is a plastic surgeon to check it out.  Once the bandages came off the full extent of the injury became clear. She shared a picture of the injuries she received, showing the horrendous burn down her thigh. The video has since had over . million views, and Badesim filmed a part two video to answer questions about the incident asked by her horried followers. In it she said: My family and I were very shocked to see what was underneath the bandages, we were not expecting that at all. My uncle was surprised that I didnapost pass out from pain but I guess that was because she kept telling me I was making a big deal out of it, so I kind of just sucked it up. The following two-three weeks I had to go to my uncleaposs clinic every single day becausea burn like that gets infected it could end up horrible. I couldnapost walk properly for a while either because just putting pressure on that leg hurt. In another follow up video Badesim said her leg had healed nicely, and you could only see what had happenedyou looked very closely. She also explained why she decided not to sue the beautician - but added she regrets not taking action at the time. Badesim also revealed the salon she went to closed only two months after her incident, although she did not find out why. My family asked meI wanted to sue and they said they would respect my decision and me being , I feel like I was very naïve, she explained. I knew that the lady who was waxing me had a young daughter and I didnapost want her to suffer because of her mumaposs mistakes. But now looking back at it, thataposs not how it works and I should have sued. Not even because of the fact that she burned me but because of the fact that she made a -year-old girl feel like she was making a big deal and that she was guilty for being in pain.

The funny scene was filmed in the city of Lianyungang in the Chinese province of Jiangsu on th November, and the footage has been widely shared on the social network Douyin, which is what TikTok is called in China. According to the news site Baidu, the university student, name not reported, prepared a ceremony to confess his love to the girl of his dreams. However, when the lights were turned out and the student had to step off the stage to confess his love to the young woman, he went up to the wrong person while full of nerves and unable to see properly.  In the footage, the student is seen giving a speech to classmates on a stage in preparation for his romantic gesture. The lights are turned off and the young man goes off to find his love interest in the dark. In the shadows, he is seen dropping to one knee in front of a woman at the back of the room and proffering the flowers at her.  However, he promptly gasps and moves to another woman a few feet away as classmates erupt in laughter. According to reports, despite the mishap, the nervous young man managed to impress his love interest and they are seen sharing a tender moment together at the end of the footage.

in UK The best time to see the Leonid meteor shower in the UK this week is in the early hours of Thursday morning, between midnight and dawn.It is expected to be clearest just before dawn when the moon has set, with predictions suggesting we could see up to  meteors per hour.The meteor shower could be spotted throughout the month, however it will likely be strongest and therefore most visibleearly in the morning on November .Can I see the Leonid meteorshower in Scotland To spot the Leonid meteor shower, certain conditions are required, including a clear nightsky.Unfortunately, weather conditions in Scotland for early Thursday morning look set to be cloudy with rain, which does not provide ideal conditions for seeing shooting stars.Those in the south are in for a better chance atseeing the display, with more intermittent cloudand dry weather forecast.However, we cant rule out seeing the meteor shower in Scotland for goodeven though Thursday morning will mark the point with the most shooting stars, the Leonid shower could continue in the following days, just with fewer meteors.Its best therefore to keep your eyes peeled over the coming days to be in with a chance of spotting some shooting stars.Where am I most likely to see shooting stars Generally, the shooting stars are easier to see in rural places away from street lights and light pollution.Its also good to be in a wide open space to give maximum opportunity to see the stars light up the

Thursday morning look set to be cloudy with rain, which does not provide ideal conditions for seeing shooting stars.Those in the south are in for a better chance atseeing the display, with more intermittent cloudand dry weather forecast.However, we cant rule out seeing the meteor shower in Scotland for goodeven though Thursday morning will mark the point with the most shooting stars, the Leonid shower could continue in the following days, just with fewer meteors.Its best therefore to keep your eyes peeled over the coming days to be in with a chance of spotting some shooting stars.Generally, the shooting stars are easier to see in rural places away from street lights and light pollution.Its also good to be in a wide open space to give maximum opportunity to see the stars light up the sky."},{"url":null,"title":"key-points-nicola-sturgeon-covid-update-new-rules-introduced","story":"In her absence over the past two Tuesdays, health secretary Humza Yousaf and deputy first minister John Swinney stepped in, with the latter warning last week that changes to the current rules could be on their way.Indeed, today not only marked the first ministersto the Covid briefings, but also the three weekly review of the restrictions currently in place, when the government decides whether to adapt current measures.The past two days have seen a flurry of Covid related announcements Boris Johnson gave a press briefing yesterday in which he refused to rule out the reintroduction of restrictions in England, and the vaccine booster scheme was extended to include --year-olds.Nowin the aftermath of COP, which experts warned could lead to a spike in cases, the Scottish government is consideringimplementing some changes to the current Covid measures in Scotland.Heres everything you need to know...Today marked the three week review of Covid rules, with the Scottish government deciding not to implement any changes at the moment.However, the first minister did confirm they were considering making changes to the current rules on vaccine passports, with a decision due to come in the coming days.Last week deputy first minister John Swinney said the government was considering extending the use of vaccine passports to wider hospitality settings.Today, the first minister confirmed that these changes were still under consideration.If such measures are introduced, it would meanpeople wouldrequire vaccine passports to visit venues such as indoor theatres,cinemas and some licensed hospitality venues, as well as nightclubs and large scale events.Any changes would be introduced from December , according to the first minister.Despite experts warning before the climate conference that we could see Covid figures surge, this does not currently appear to be the case according to the first minister.She said that although we couldnt draw \"finalconclsuions\" as of yet, \"there is no sign so far of any signicant spike in cases associated with COP.\"The first minister also used the example of COP as a reason to use lateral flow tests, which she advised people took twice a week as well asremindingthe public that these tests can be ordered online for free.Yesterday it was confirmed that people aged - in Scotland would be offered a Covid booster jab, after results found that a third dose signicantly improved protection.On Monday, the online portal opened for over-s in Scotland to book their booster jabs, with the first minister confirming over-s would be invited for their boosters once the top priority groups were vaccinated.Booster jabs can only be given -weeks or  months after receiving the second dose of the Covid jab.Despite COP not yet seeming to have a huge impact on figures in Scotland, the first minister did confirm that Covid cases were rising slightly, with the daily average up to around ,.In the last -hours, , new cases of Covid were reported, while  people were in hospital and in intensive care.A further  deaths were recorded.Speaking on these figures, the first minister said: \"The numbers reported in recent days here in Scotland - which Irsquoll come on to talk about - illustrate the need for continued precautions. So too does the challenging situation being experienced again across Europe.\"Drawing on infection rates in Germany and Austria among other European nations experiencing surging Covid numbers, Sturgeon added: \"All of this is a reminder that governments everywhere are grappling with the same issues and dilemmas we are.\"Covid case rates may be rising slightly, but they are decreasing amongst the older population.Infection rates in the + age group are declining, which the first minister suggested was likely linked to the Covid booster jab, with  million third doses administered.The first minister added that Scotland was the most vaccinated nation in the UK, saying: \"It is worth pointing out that on first, second, booster and third doses, Scotland is currently the most vaccinated part of the UK.\"That is down to the incredible hard work of everyone involved in organising and delivering the programme and I want to record my thanks to each and every one of them.\""},{"url":null,"title":"st-andrews-day-2021-bank-holiday-get-day-off","story":"Officially, St Andrews Day is a bank holiday in Scotland however it doesnt necessarily mean we get a day off work...Heres everything you need to know...St Andrews Day was officially declared a bank holiday by the Scottish government in .However, banks are not required to close on November they do not want to.If  November occurs on a weekend, the bank holiday is moved to the following Monday.Despite being a bank holiday, employers are not actually required by law to give employees a holiday on the St Andrews Day bank holiday.Meanwhile, schools do not take St AndrewsDayoff meaning pupils are still required to go to school.This year St Andrews Day will fall on Tuesday November .On St Andrews Day, the saltire must be flown on all Scottish government buildings.Any celebrations tend to revolve around Scottish food and drink like haggis and whisky as well as traditionalmusic and dancing.After St Andrews Day, the next bank holidays in Scotland are as follows:"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-v-japan-tv-channel-kick-off-time-scotland-rugby-match","story":"Last week the team played a dominant South African side who defeated Scotland -

I was left to my own defence within an office that was feral, in an office that they knew was misogynistic and racist. And because I spoke out, I was dismissed and I am now in an employment tribunal.Ms Fitzpatrick claims that she made several public interest disclosures to Marine Scotland which contributed to her dismissal.These include emailing a diary of bullying and misogyny to HR in August , reporting an alleged assault in the workplace in September  and reporting the chair incident, which she claims took place in December .She is also trying to claim that she suffered religious discrimination when threatened with disciplinary action for taking time off to be at her fatherrsquos bedside, and that she was subjected to disability discrimination when bosses went ahead with her disciplinary hearing without her despite medical advice saying she was unable to attend.Referring to her age, sex and race discrimination claims, she told the tribunal: ldquoIf I was a young, Scottish man I wouldnrsquot be here today.Solicitor Andrew Gibson told the tribunal that Ms Fitzpatrick was dismissed for lying about elements of the chair incident.He said: ldquoWhat is in dispute is that the incident took place against the claimantrsquos will and that it was in any way, shape or form an assault.ldquoMy clientrsquos position is that it was done entirely with her consent as part of the joking behaviour which was going on in the office.The lawyer added that a forensic expert found that the photograph was taken in , not in , which disputes Ms Fitzpatrickrsquos claim that it was done in response to her blowing the whistle.Mr Gibson said: ldquoThatrsquos a signicant hood which had signicant consequences for two employees at Marine Scotland who were questioned by the police.He submitted that the additional claims should not be allowed to go ahead as they had been lodged late in proceedings and related to ldquovery historic incidents.Employment judge Alexander Kemp will give his decision on the amendments in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-must-take-back-basics-japan---martin-hannan","story":"I hope he goes for the latter and puts out Scotlandrsquos strongest  against Japan. For as Saturdayrsquos disappointing defeat to South Africa showed, the Scots are in need of match practice together, and that means going back to the basics, especially up front.After a plethora of matches in which Scotland did the right things at scrums and lineouts and ultimately got the wins they deserved, it all came crashing down on Saturday against South Africa and proved yet again the truth of that old adages, games are won and lost up front.I donrsquot for a minute think Scotland deserved to win at Murrayfield, and donrsquot forget the Springboks were missing the likes of scrum-half Faf de Klerk, World Player of the Year Pieter-Steph du Toit, star prop Frans Malherbe and brilliant winger Cheslin Kolbe and yet they still won comfortably with their domination in the tight being the key to the win.The absence through injury of Rory Sutherland proved a major handicap, because on Saturday the Scottish pack was taken to scrum school by the Boks. I am sure the British and Irish Lion would have made a dference, because Pierre Schoeman, Stuart McInally and Zander Fagerson were under the cosh right from the start and Sutherland is too clever and too experienced to allow that.Some might argue that referee Angus Gardner was too harsh on the Scots, but he can only penalise what he sees and the total of five scrum penalties conceded by the Scots over the  minutes tells its own story.The starting Springbok front row of Ox Ncheacute, Bongi Mbonambi and Trevor Nyakan were brutally strong but they were also incredibly clever in the way they bossed Scotland and forced the concession of three penalties. That head coach Jacques Nienaber stuck with the tactics of his predecessor Rassie Erasmus and deployed the so-called Bomb Squad before half-time was a calculated gesture which was basically saying lsquowe own your bahookies, Scotlandrsquo and Steven Kitshoff, Malcolm Marx and Vincent Koch won two more scrum penalties.Why do I say clever  A proper scrum is a very dynamic thing, especially for the front row. To all those fancy dans in the backs, it just seems to be two sets of big people involved in a shoving contest, but anyone who has ever packed down as a prop or a hooker knows that there is a science to scrummaging and you need to be constantly aware of the subtleties of the contest. Above all, from No  to No  you have to do your job all the time, from forming the scrum right through to breaking off and going back to loose play.Scotland did not respond to South Africarsquos tactical shoves, not all of them straight by any means, and duly paid the penalty, with penalty being the operative word.I thought the Scots looked asthey had spent too much time at the scrum machine and not enough time working out the correct response to the South African tactics which were masterful. The Boks did not exert a full eight-man shove all the time, but ied their approach, the front five shting left and right and looking for Scottish weaknesses, which they found and exploited. Sometimes they shoved down one side and forced the Scottish scrum to twist, at others they absorbed Scottish surges only to come back even stronger at a clearly prearranged signal.The arrival of the Bomb Squad in the thminute was also a telling piece of game play by Nienaber. He told the six front row men beforehand they would all get a half each, and that meant they could both expend a massive amount of energy knowing they would not need to do so for  minutes. You might not think thatrsquos a very nice thing to do, but itrsquos perfectly within the rules as they stand. By contrast, Schoeman, McInally and Fagerson all played more than an hour and looked out on their feet in the third quarter.There were a few things that Scotland could take out of the match, but overall it was proof thatScotland are going to reach the semis of the World Cup in , then they have a lot to learn, not least how to manage playing two of the top three sides in the world in successive matches.Now itrsquos Japan, and I hope Townsend makes a statement ndash this is my best , with the exception of Rory Sutherland, and we are going back to basics to win."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-surely-much-important-things-get-agitated-not-able-see-scotland-games-tv","story":"It is a shame that the Scotland match was not on a free channel for all to watch as it was a fantastic game, butyou vote SNP because STV donrsquot show Scottish football, you are shooting yourself in the foot.Bill Shankly, who is reported to have said \"Some people believe football is a matter of le and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude.

The truth is quite dferent.In , the Church of Scotland concluded that each year between -% of total revenue raised in Scotland was spent outside Scotland, negatively impacting Scottish employment and contributing to a continuous stream of emigration. Today itrsquos worse. London keeps even more of our revenue and charges us billions for a UK, not Scottish, debt.Then came North Sea oil. The  McCrone Report concluded that ldquoan independent Scotland could expect to have massive surpluses that ldquocould last for a very long time into the future. It was kept secret becausethe Scottish people had known about it, support for restoring independence would have surged. If Scotland had been independent, it would now have pound billion in a sovereign wealth fund.The North Sea oil steal is being re-enacted with our renewables. The privatised National Grid grossly overcharges Scottish renewable companies but generously subsidises companies in the south-east of England.And then therersquos Brexit: enough said.The Union has \"delivered\" lower investment, higher unemployment, weaker economic growth, falling living standards, net economic migration and rising poverty and inequality.Scotland, a highly educated nation of five million, with an advanced economy and more than a third of the UKrsquos natural wealth, would thrive outside the UK. Lord Dunlop knows it, which explains his tortured efforts to convince us otherwise.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.* I READ with great interest Andrew Dunlops column.

She saw service in the North Sea and the Baltic. The gun from this vessel in the Museum’s collection is missing its gun shield.HMS Hampshire struck a German mine off Marwick Head in heavy weather on the evening of June , , and sank within  minutes.

She explained that a formal decision on this would be announced next Tuesday, and that consultation with businesses would take place later this week.The First Minister said that extension of the scheme is likely to include a broader scope of businesses, such as indoor cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues. This would mean that, save for limited exemptions, these venues would require members of the public to provide proof of vaccination before entry. She said that the scheme may also begin to accept proof of a recent negative COVID- test as an alternative to the vaccine passport.Ms Sturgeon, who said that while she hoped to keep businesses across Scotland open throughout the winter, the Government has not completely ruled introducing harsher restrictions should the COVID- situation worsen. She has urged all business owners and employers to think carefully and #look again# at whether their employees can be supported to work from home, this winter.#While we hope we will get through winter without introducing further restrictions, we do have a duty to keep proportionate options under review,# she said.#We are publishing an updated strategic framework today, covering some of the issues have already summarised.#Finally, the First Minister urged the nation to stick as closely to the current guidance as possible in order to prevent the spread of COVID-. This includes undertaking a lateral flow test twice-weekly, and PCR testingyou develop symptoms, have a positive lateral flow or are contact traced.She also appealed to all those who have not yet taken up a COVID- vaccine, and are eligible, to please do so.

But it is unbelievable.Under the Governmentrsquos proposals, set out in a letter to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, rules would be updated to include two key recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Lersquos report on MPsrsquo outside interests from .These include changing the code of conduct so that any outside work should be ldquowithin reasonable limits and ldquonot prevent them from fully carrying out their duties.Those who failed to comply should be ldquoinvestigated and appropriately punished.I have written to the Commons Speaker to propose: The Code of Conduct for MPs is updated MPs who are prioritising outside interests over their constituents are investigated and appropriately punished MPs are banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists pic SSQqrKRCGmdash Boris JohnsonNovember , The changes would also ban MPs from accepting paid work as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant, and from accepting payment or offers of employment to act as political consultants.A Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.ldquoThis means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.ldquoThis will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.But Chris Bryant, the Labour chairman of the Committee on Standards, replied to the statement on Twitter saying: ldquoExcept it doesnrsquot mean that. We havenrsquot changed anything yet.Mr Bryant then added in a statement that he hoped to have a final report on the committeersquos proposed changes ready to present to the Commons in early .He said: ldquoAny changes to the code would then require the Government to table the necessary motions and allow time for a debate on the floor of the House.The changes are likely to deepen tensions between Tory MPs.Earlier, Sir Geoffrey Clton-Brown, treasurer of the  Committee, said there was ldquodissatisfaction with the Prime Minister in the Tory ranks.And speaking to GB News, former minister Johnny Mercer said: ldquoThere are serious problems in the quality of our politics at the moment.The Tory MP for Plymouth Moor View, who has been outspoken against the Government since losing his job as veterans minister, added that he had ldquono relationship with Mr Johnson, despite initially backing him as leader.While Sir Keir said: ldquoIrsquove been really struck by how many Tory MPs seem to have lost faith and confidence in the Prime Minister.ldquoIt was noticeable at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions today that their benches were with many gaps, many MPs hadnrsquot turned up to support him.However, Mr Johnson was greeted at the  Committee of backbench MPs on Wednesday evening, prior to the vote, to loud banging on the tables in approval.It was reported that he told MPs ldquoon a clear road I crashed the car into a ditch in the saga surrounding former Tory MP Owen Paterson, who was found to have breached lobbying rules.But one backbencher said that the vast majority of questions at the meeting were surrounding the issue of small boats and immigration. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson giving evidence to the Liaison Committee at the House of Commons, London Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Johnson admitted the initial effort to shield Mr Paterson from immediate suspension to enable a review of his case and the disciplinary process had been an error.ldquoThe intention genuinely was not to exonerate anybody, the intention was to see whether there was some way in which, on a cross-party basis, we could improve the system, Mr Johnson told the Liaison Committee of senior MPs.ldquoIn retrospect it was obviously, obviously mistaken to think we could conflate the two things and do I regret that decision ldquoYes I certainly do.Mr Paterson quit as an MP rather than face a vote on his suspension after the Government abandoned its bid to shield him from an immediate sanction.The PM also insisted he wanted to find a cross-party approach to the Westminster sleaze rows but became involved in spiky Commons exchanges with Sir Keir during PMQs over his own outside earnings as a lawyer prior to becoming Labour leader.The Speaker repeatedly ordered Mr Johnson to stop asking Sir Keir questions and said the exchanges had been ldquoill-tempered, adding: ldquoI need this House to gain respect but it starts by iniduals showing respect for each other.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I apologise for the hurt that my refusal to retract that statement has caused to Bishop Bellrsquos surviving relatives, colleagues and longstanding supporters.A second review was launched after the Church of England handed ldquofresh information to Sussex Police about Mr Bell in January .It was carried out by senior ecclesiastical lawyer Timothy Briden, the vicar general of Canterbury.The Churchrsquos national safeguarding team published its findings of the second inquiry in January  and said the new allegations were ldquounfounded.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days."},{"url":null,"title":"covid passports one piece in a jigsaw of required measures says swann as stormont ministers back plan","story":"DUP MP Sammy Wilson defended people’s right to choose to get or not get vaccinated after party decided not to block move at Executive meeting\"srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w\" sizes\"auto\"  ExpandExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Stock Image: The COVIDCert NI app that displays vaccination passports for domestic and travel use on November,   Kevin Scott   Belfast The Assembly met on Wednesday to debate Covid passports FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueStock Image: The COVIDCert NI app that displays vaccination passports for domestic and travel use on November,   Gillian HallidayTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMandatory vaccine passports are set to be introduced in Northern Ireland next month after Stormont ministers voted by a majority to support the move – which has been branded “stupid policy” by DUP MP Sammy Wilson.DUP ministers opposed Health Minister Robin Swann#s proposal at the Executive meeting on Wednesday.However, the party did not deploy a cross-community voting mechanism to block the introduction of vaccine certication in the region. It was passed by six votes to four.Read MoreCovid certication NI: all you need to know about the contentious policyRead MoreFive simple steps to bring NI Covid cases down without locking downEmpty stadiums, hospitality restrictions, financial incentives: How the rest of Europe is grappling with Covid surgesCoronavirus NI:  deaths, , cases, % hospital capacity as Executive considers passport planBBC Radio Ulster’s Evening Extra has reported that a two-week ‘grace period’ will be introduced in the run-up to the new measure being introduced on December .It is thought venues could face fixed penalty finesthey do not comply.

We have to act.”The existing CovidCert NI app, developed to support international travel, has now also been updated to allow the public to display a domestic use certicate as well as the existing certicate for travel.DUP MP Sammy Wilson, who has branded the use of Covid passports an “unacceptable step” into people’s personal lives, said he remained opposed to its introduction.This is something which should not have been put through in haste the way it has done,” he told Evening Extra.Pointing out his party had voted against the move, the short timescale involved in pushing through the measure, was “not the way of making policy”.“It’s not the way of making policy, simply to cover up for the inability of the Minister [Robin Swann] who has had a year and a half to get hospitals geared up to dealing with Covid,” he explained.And yet we find that the same reasons are being used for yet measures today as were argued a year and a half ago: to save the NHS.How many times are the public, and hospitality sector – or other parts of the economy – have to have penalties imposed on them to save the Minister from the consequences of his own lack of planning.”Askedhe would show a Covid passport himself, Mr Wilson stressed he did not believe anyone should have to disclose their medical status to anyone.I could be excluded, or other iniduals could be excluded, from a cafe where there’s only two customers sitting and I could go home on a packed bus and I would be required to show a Covid passport in a half-empty cafe. But not required to show a Covid passport on a packed bus. That’s how stupid this policy is.”Pressed againhe would get a passport, Mr Wilson said people in society should be free to make decisions for themselves in relation to getting the vaccine.Askedhe was disappointed that his party did not deploy the blocking mechanism to prevent passports being passed, the MP said he was not yet aware why the veto was not used.It may well be that our Ministers did not decide to use the veto until they have additional information,” he explained.It’s a question you would have to ask our Ministers.”He added: “I think this a bad policy for many sectors which are already floundering… It’s also a policy that will give a  sense of security to many iniduals.Because don’t forget that having a covid passport, or having a vaccination, does not stop people getting infected… or stop them passing on the infection.”Public health experts have said those who are vaccinated are less likely to transmit the virus and will have less severe symptomsthey contract Covid.TUV leader Jim Allister branded the move “wrongheaded both in focus and effect”, insisting the policy must be brought to the Assembly for an early vote.“The common practice of voting on these proposals weeks after implementation won’t do,” he said.“Until now any restrictions have applied equally to all. Now, this move picks out a section of society for the special treatment of exclusion on a mandatory basis. This is wrong.Encouragement of hospitality businesses and events organisers to seek proof of vaccine or a negative test is one thing, and to me acceptable, but to make such mandatory is a step too far.”He added: “The clear purpose of the mandatory Vaccine Passport is to compel people to get vaccinated, yet, the Executive would not dare make vaccination mandatory but seeks the same outcome by the stealth of mandatory passports.”Meanwhile, Adrian McNally, general manager of Titanic Hotel, said he was in favour of the policy, insisting it gives assurance to people coming into venues.For  days so far across the lockdowns, hospitality has been closed in the hotel sector.. I don’t want a -day closure so anything the Department of Health is going to do that I can continue to trade and accept guests, I am going to go along with that,” he told Evening Extra.That’s the reasonable thing to do.”SDLP MLA Nichola Mallon MLA  said the decision should have been taken when the party first proposed it two months ago to relieve pressure on health services.“Instead, emergency health services have been brought to brink. In the middle of this crisis political leaders cannot afford to put popularity ahead of public health,” she said.“It is critical now that implementation of the certication programme and the winter contingency plan is accelerated. Securing certication has been an uphill struggle but it will not be enough on its own to protect the health service and prevent people from getting sick.“The last thing people want is another Christmas apart from each other. The SDLP is warning that we need to act now to use every tool in our toolbox to protect our health service, keep our businesses safely open and prevent any further lockdown.”Read MoreCancel Christmas work party and Santa visit to keep Covid cases down, says public health expertRelated topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyCovid certication NI: all you need to know about the contentious policy PremiumEmpty stadiums, hospitality restrictions, financial incentives: How the rest of Europe is grappling with Covid surgesCovid passports NI: DUP’s Sammy Wilson blasts plan as ‘unacceptable step towards unwarranted state control of people’s lives’North Coast families priced out by second homers PremiumNichola Mallon open to congestion charging in NI cities to cut emissionsMost ReadFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningWatchdog to assess claim Minister has a ‘conflict of interest’Video: Inside the Elk teen disco linked to  Covid cases and  more self-isolatingDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorQuestions mount for BBC after Donna Traynor’s surprise departureTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlaySpectacular Derry Christmas house lights draws crowdsLatest CoronavirusCancel Christmas work party and Santa visit to keep Covid cases down, says public health expertVideo: Inside the Elk teen disco linked to  Covid cases and  more self-isolatingMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageHospital AE capacity emergency in NI ‘a very real possibility’DUP ministers should not be ‘driven by ideology’ on Covid passport proposal, warns Naomi LongLatestRepublican representative censured by US House over violent animated videoMan seriously injured in Dublin shootingMan charged as part of investigation into North Antrim UDAEbony Rainford-Brent shares sickening racist hate letter she receivedMinister urged to accept all recommendations from R helicopter crash report,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit:: Kirsty O#Connor PA WireMark BainTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe majority of people in Northern Ireland would welcome the introduction of mandatory Covid passports, a new poll has indicated.Almost two thirdsof those questioned by Lucid Talk said they would have no issuethe passports were introduced for the hospitality sector to allow them entry to pubs, restaurants and nightclubs.A new app which allows users to show proof of Covid- vaccination status within Northern Ireland was launched by the Department of Health earlier this month to facilitate voluntary checks in hospitality and entertainment venues. Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of HealthCovid certication NI: all you need to know about the contentious policy PremiumTaxpayer billed £k for every Covid case in Northern Ireland’s quarantine hotel PremiumScrapped procedures ‘forcing surgeons into private sector’ in Northern IrelandCraigavon Area Hospital operating at full capacity as Covid- patients double in two weeksNI students to protest Stormont in call to support health workersMost ReadFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningWatchdog to assess claim Minister has a ‘conflict of interest’Video: Inside the Elk teen disco linked to  Covid cases and  more self-isolatingDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorQuestions mount for BBC after Donna Traynor’s surprise departureLatest CoronavirusCovid passports ‘one piece in a jigsaw of required measures’, says Swann as Stormont ministers back planCancel Christmas work party and Santa visit to keep Covid cases down, says public health expertVideo: Inside the Elk teen disco linked to  Covid cases and  more self-isolatingMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageHospital AE capacity emergency in NI ‘a very real possibility’LatestMan seriously injured in Dublin shootingMan charged as part of investigation into North Antrim UDAEbony Rainford-Brent shares sickening racist hate letter she receivedMinister urged to accept all recommendations from R helicopter crash reportWill Smith discusses lessons learned playing Venus and Serena Williams’ father,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles.”He added: “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses.“The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people.“Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act.“Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable.“We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands.”What has been the reaction to the Executive’s decision The response from the hospitality sector has been mixed, however, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, has expressed disappointment at the vaccine passport decision.The decision to impose mandatory Covid passports on the entire hospitality industry, without any mention of support, sends a clear signal that we are of no value or concern, he said. Today is another day we have been singled out. The majority of our sector have voiced opposition.There is real concern from our industry that businesses owners, who are already struggling to recover and now facing the most critical period of the year, will be the ones who must be the enforcers of the scheme, and it is our staff that will face the abuse.Evidence shows that this will negatively impact footfall and increase costs in the most important part of the year.As the worst-impacted industry, and the one singled out repeatedly for restrictions, we are facing an unknown future. Our industry will have to fight to retain staff and save businesses.Politically, the DUP is the only party which has opposed the move while others including Alliance and the SDLP have been vocal in supporting the policy.Its Stormont First Minister, Paul Givan described the introduction of Covid certication, as “isive”, saying: “We should be using every tool in our box to try and address the transmission rates and the pressures on our hospitals, it is vital that this executive does the right things.Whenever we asked the questions around how effective would this policy be it was marginal. There has been no assessment on the effectiveness, we look at the Republic of Ireland that has had this scheme in, their rates of transmission has been much higher than NI, their hospital pressures are higher than NI.”He claimed that no economic impact assessment, equality impact assessment or assessment in terms of human rights legislation has been carried out.“Other executive ministers felt that they could support a policy that had flaws within that paper even on the scientic evidence,” he said.“They used the Alpha iant to say that this scheme could help in terms of reducing transmission based upon a iant which no longer exists in Northern Ireland because it’s the Delta iant.“So the scientic basis for it was flawed and yet other ministers they have voted this through and now as a result businesses could be facing fines on their first offence.”Read MoreCovid passports will lead to job losses Hospitality Ulster chief warns, as Executive considers December  introductionRelated topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Department of Health PremiumTaxpayer billed £k for every Covid case in Northern Ireland’s quarantine hotel PremiumMajority of people in favour of mandatory Covid passports PremiumScrapped procedures ‘forcing surgeons into private sector’ in Northern IrelandCraigavon Area Hospital operating at full capacity as Covid- patients double in two weeksNI students to protest Stormont in call to support health workersMost ReadFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningWatchdog to assess claim Minister has a ‘conflict of interest’Donna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorVideo: Inside the Elk teen disco linked to  Covid cases and  more self-isolatingPictured: Man in court charged with threatening to kill Health Minister Robin Swann identied through Twitter handle used, court toldTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlaySpectacular Derry Christmas house lights draws crowdsLatest Northern IrelandBoy hospitalised after assault at teen disco linked to  Covid casesMan charged as part of investigation into North Antrim UDAEx-Bangor Grammar vice principal Lindsay Thompson Brown to be released days after new jail sentence for child abuseMother of bomb victim asks PM’s we to join fight against amnestyMandatory vaccine passports approved in Northern Ireland despite DUP objectionsLatestBoy hospitalised after assault at teen disco linked to  Covid casesEngland must learn from Lions’ mistakes in Springboks clash, says Tom CurryInjury-hit Wales ‘desperate’ to end autumn campaign on a high – Nick TompkinsRepublican representative censured by US House over violent animated videoMan seriously injured in Dublin shooting,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to £, in England.The percentage increases here are roughly in line with information gathered from real estate experts, though a recent Ulster University survey of agents, based on , transactions, puts the overall average house price much higher at £,, up by approximately % over the year.Lead researcher Dr Michael McCord said on the publication of the report last week that he believes the lack of quality housing supply, “compounded with the volatile economic setting posed by the precarious inflationary environment, poses some challenges ahead for the housing market”.The UU survey found average property prices range from £, in Derry City and Strabane to £, in Ards and North Down.According to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyorsand Ulster Bank, the number of properties being listed for sale fell in October, adding to existing supply issues.Feedback from surveyors is that the lack of stock on their books is pushing up prices and limiting sales activity, RICS spokesman Samuel Dickey said.“This has been an issue for some time, but it seems to be intensying and there is little sign that it will improve in the near future,” he stated.“Agents will be hoping that the new year will bring a new impetus from potential sellers to list their properties for sale and help boost sales activity and alleviate some of the price pressures.”Most ReadFormer SF mayor behind offensive

When contacted by the Belfast , Dr McCullough said the law prohibits her from disclosing any information on any complaint under investigation but “all admissible complaints” are investigated thoroughly.Ultimately, Ministers who sit on the Executive, including Nichola Mallon, will decide which policy options go out to public consultation in the coming weeks.However, a DfI spokesperson said: “The Department for Infrastructure does not have responsibility for petroleum licensing policy and the determination of petroleum exploration licence applications.“In her role as Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon has made clear on many occasions her commitment to the principles of public le. Minister Mallon has formally declared in the interests of openness and transparency and in line with her responsibilities as Minister, that her husband is employed by a public relations company.“The Minister discussed the matter with the Department’s Permanent Secretary and declared any relevant interests as part of the Department of Finance’s scheme defining the categories of financial and other interests that are registrable by Ministers and special advisers.“In the event that a conflictwere to arise with her responsibilities either as Minister or as a member of the Executive, the Minister will follow all guidance and protocols covering conflicts of interest.” At Cop, Ms Mallon signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans. She said she has taken decisive action to ensure the planning system helps us tackle climate change.​​​​​​This article was amended to add comment from MW Advocate.

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive.

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question.

That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI.

This development within the Park-based group prompted Caroline to take action and so she got in touch with the Alzheimers Society straight away. Within weeks, the group had organised a dementia awareness workshop which saw almost  people turn up. Caroline said: “When we saw the turnout at these events we thought to ourselves theres something happening here, we have high numbers of people in the community looking for information on Alzheimer’s. “We were overwhelmed with the interest and numbers attending and this led to two further workshops being organised with one specically for businesses –  businesses attended. “The large attendance at the workshops subsequently led to the formation of a support group and a volunteer led signposting centre facilitated by Marie Gormley.” Having noticed the demand within the rural community for more support, Caroline helped set up a partnership between the Learmount group, Alzheimer’s Society and Claudy Health Centre to register to become a Dementia Friendly Community . The group also managed to secure funding through the Rural Development Programme, Housing Executive and Derry City and Strabane District Council. The funding was used to make dementia-friendly adjustments to the community groups building. This included signage, colour coding, training facilities and utensils that those with dementia could use. After seeing an advert in a paper for the Old Library Trusts Memory Cafe, Caroline set off for Derry to try and find out how she could set up a similar one in Park. This meeting started a conversation with the Old Library Trust who expressed an interest in including the Learmount group in their DEEDSproject. Shortly after the Old Library Trust secured funding through the National Lottery Community Fund for the project, Learmounts Dementia Social Club was born. Held every Monday morning, the social club have members from Feeny, Claudy, Park, Dungiven and Donemana attend. “We see ourselves as a Dementia Hub for the community and these mornings work so well for us – they are just the loveliest mornings and everyone benefits from them,” continued Caroline. “The carers come along as well and they get so much out of it too because they are meeting other carers who are dealing with the same concerns as them. “We have such great volunteers here in Learmount who have so much enthusiasm and dedication turning up weekly to help the group.” In , Learmount Community Development Group were nominated by the Alzheimers Society for their Dementia Friendly Awards, which they ended up winning. The north Derry groups services are also listed in the Alzheimers Societys literature which is distributed as far away as Scotland. “The social mornings happened so naturally and it just goes to show youthere is an identied need, opportunities will arise from it,” said Caroline. Although Covid- halted the social mornings run by the centre, they have since reconvened and members are delighted to be back. Just a few weeks back, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Graham Warke paid a visit to the Dementia Social Club to congratulate them on being awarded runner up in the Well Being Category of the IPB Pride of Place Awards. The group was nominated for the award by the council and were delighted to receive recognition for the work of their dementia volunteers, families, the Learmount Group and their DEEDS partners at the Old Library Trust. “Having this service is great because in rural areas it helps to remove the stigma and families are more willing to come forward and receive the support thats there on their doorstep,” continued Caroline. “We have guest speakers who come along to the social mornings and it’s just great to have that support around the table. “We would like to thank DEEDS, Claudy Health Centre and the Alzheimers Society for bringing their knowledge and support. They have been so supportive of the work that we are trying to do.” Although they are at full numbers for the social mornings at present, Caroline hopes going forward they will be able to get more families on-board. “Dementia sufferers get huge benefits from the social mornings, members look forward to coming here because it is a safe environment and they feel included in the community.” The McGrellis family recently visited the Dementia Social Club to present Patrick Conway, chairperson of the Learmount Group, with a cheque for pound, the proceeds from their Dan McGrellis, Memorial Charity Golf Day held on August . In total the McGrellis family raised pound, which was ided between Learmount Dementia Group and Marie Curie. Patrick Conway thanked the McGrellis family for the overwhelming amount raised at the charity event. Patrick continued that the generous donation would be used specically to retain dementia services in the local area and would have a huge impact on the support we can offer families. “Over the past six months, Learmount dementia services have received numerous donations from families living in the area – Shaun Mulhern and Ciaran Hutton, Annie-Teresa OKane and family and the McGrellis family - which we are so grateful for and it means that we wont lose our servicesfunding is stopped.” Patrick encouraged anyone who has a family member who has entered the early stages of dementia and would like support to get in touch by contacting the Learmount Group on .

This development within the Park-based group prompted Caroline to take action and so she got in touch with the Alzheimers Society straight away. Within weeks, the group had organised a dementia awareness workshop which saw almost  people turn up. Caroline said: “When we saw the turnout at these events we thought to ourselves theres something happening here, we have high numbers of people in the community looking for information on Alzheimer’s. “We were overwhelmed with the interest and numbers attending and this led to two further workshops being organised with one specically for businesses –  businesses attended. “The large attendance at the workshops subsequently led to the formation of a support group and a volunteer led signposting centre facilitated by Marie Gormley.” Having noticed the demand within the rural community for more support, Caroline helped set up a partnership between the Learmount group, Alzheimer’s Society and Claudy Health Centre to register to become a Dementia Friendly Community . The group also managed to secure funding through the Rural Development Programme, Housing Executive and Derry City and Strabane District Council. The funding was used to make dementia-friendly adjustments to the community groups building. This included signage, colour coding, training facilities and utensils that those with dementia could use. After seeing an advert in a paper for the Old Library Trusts Memory Cafe, Caroline set off for Derry to try and find out how she could set up a similar one in Park. This meeting started a conversation with the Old Library Trust who expressed an interest in including the Learmount group in their DEEDSproject. Shortly after the Old Library Trust secured funding through the National Lottery Community Fund for the project, Learmounts Dementia Social Club was born. Held every Monday morning, the social club have members from Feeny, Claudy, Park, Dungiven and Donemana attend. “We see ourselves as a Dementia Hub for the community and these mornings work so well for us – they are just the loveliest mornings and everyone benefits from them,” continued Caroline. “The carers come along as well and they get so much out of it too because they are meeting other carers who are dealing with the same concerns as them. “We have such great volunteers here in Learmount who have so much enthusiasm and dedication turning up weekly to help the group.” In , Learmount Community Development Group were nominated by the Alzheimers Society for their Dementia Friendly Awards, which they ended up winning. The north Derry groups services are also listed in the Alzheimers Societys literature which is distributed as far away as Scotland. “The social mornings happened so naturally and it just goes to show youthere is an identied need, opportunities will arise from it,” said Caroline. Although Covid- halted the social mornings run by the centre, they have since reconvened and members are delighted to be back. Just a few weeks back, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Graham Warke paid a visit to the Dementia Social Club to congratulate them on being awarded runner up in the Well Being Category of the IPB Pride of Place Awards. The group was nominated for the award by the council and were delighted to receive recognition for the work of their dementia volunteers, families, the Learmount Group and their DEEDS partners at the Old Library Trust. “Having this service is great because in rural areas it helps to remove the stigma and families are more willing to come forward and receive the support thats there on their doorstep,” continued Caroline. “We have guest speakers who come along to the social mornings and it’s just great to have that support around the table. “We would like to thank DEEDS, Claudy Health Centre and the Alzheimers Society for bringing their knowledge and support.

Ms McLaughlin said:“My thoughtstodayare with victims and survivors of these horric institutions who are hopefully finally at the beginning of the end of a very long road. While theJoint First Ministersannouncement is welcome, I still have a number of serious concerns about how the recommendations of the Truth Recovery Design Panel will be delivered. “We have repeatedly seen in the past how the Executive Office and Joint First Ministers have struggled with delivery and there can be no delay on an issue of this importance. Nearly five years on from the Hart report, victims of historic institutional abusein childrens homesare still waiting for payments, an apology and a memorial and this cannot be the case for survivors of mother and baby homes. Both of these matters must be expediated as a matter of the utmost importance. “In both cases the institutions responsible for this abuse must be compelled to fit the bill and compensate victims, they have been guilty of the worst abuses imaginable against vulnerable people and cannot expect others to pick up the pieces.  “I am also concerned that the legislation to establish the public inquiry cannot be introduced in this mandate. The survivors of mother and baby homes have waited long enough and shouldn’t have to wait a day longersomething can be done. Our institutions are currently under threat and with parties unwilling to saythey will assume office depending on the election result, I fear mother-and-baby home survivors could become the latest casualties of the dys that rules this place.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Neighbours on Racecourse Drive come together to become the brightest street in the city and raise charity fundsDerry NewsMay your Christmas be Derry and bright overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Neighbours on Racecourse Drive come together to become the brightest street in the city and raise charity fundsDerry NewsMay your Christmas be Derry and bright overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Neighbours on Racecourse Drive come together to become the brightest street in the city and raise charity fundsDerry NewsMay your Christmas be Derry and bright overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

If The Starjets sound familiar to those of a certain age, then they should as they were part of the Norths punk-scene in the late s with the band being contemporaries of Stf Little Fingers and Derrys own The Undertones. The Belfast quartet scored a hit in  with “War Stories” – a song covered by multi-million selling US rock band, Green Day last year which propelled The Starjets back amongst the big time. Their song about Lyra, who was killed in  when covering a riot in the Creggan area of Derry, is the fourth song in a tribute to women who were killed while still young – the other three being about journalist Veronica Guerin, Princess Diana and Palestinian rights activist Rachel Corrie. While singer and guitarist, Paul Bowen, hopes to get the song out to a wider audience, there is one person he hopes the song will reach – Sara Canning who was the late Lyras partner. Paul said: “I wrote this song of May , a month after Lyra was killed.  The Starjets perform a live version of Legendary Girl, a song about journalist Lyra McKee who was killed in Derry two years ago “Its part of a four-song cycle about women who were murdered or died in a tragic accident – two of them being about Irish journalists. “Lyra being one and Veronica Guerin being the other. The other two women were Princess Diana and Rachel Corrie. “The song about Lyra has received a huge amount of radio interest all over the world in places like Australia, Germany, Holland, Calornia and the UK itself. Its sitting high in two of the UKs independent charts. “The song about Lyra is up against some strong competition in the Heritage Chart. “Were up against Rod Stewart, Diana Ross and Billy Idol – we are minnows compared to them. “Were a small band from Belfast – a blip on the horizon – from the old punk era. “There was an exceptional turn of events during lockdown last year when Green Day recorded one of our songs, War Stories, which we had a minor hit with back in .  The Starjets on BBC show, Top Of The Pops, in  performing War Stories which was covered by Green Day last year “A tsunami of goodwill came our way after that. We didnt think anybody knew who we were but theres emails coming in and posts being put up on social media. “The former Radio  DJ, Mike Read – who had championed us back in the day – phoned me up and askedI had any songs as he had started the Heritage Chart for older artists who do not get played on commercial daytime radio as much. “I said I had a song about George Best, called Geordie Best and I sent it to Mike and it reached number one in that chart back in January. “Im grateful for that and Im also very grateful for all the interest the song about Lyra McKee has generated. “One of my main goals was to get the song to Lyras partner, Sara Canning because I think she would appreciate it – I hope she would. “I didnt know Lyra personally but I knew of her.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, will take part in the parade which will light up the city centre as it passes through. He will be joined by a number of festive characters and Christmas themed mobile installations. “I am really excited to take part in the parade and see our beautul city lit up for the first time,” he said. “The route is extended around the city centre so that everyone will have their opportunity to see Santa and the characters and you can pick your viewing spot along the route rather than gathering in one place.  Santa Claus, along with an unusually long-eared Mayor Graham Warke, promote Derrys Christmas programme “After last year’s virtual programme, it is particularly pleasing to allow people to attend the switch-on in person again and Council’s maintenance and electrical teams have been working hard this week to ensure the city is looking resplendent on Sunday evening.” The full parade route for Sunday is Bishop Street, The Diamond, Ferryquay Street, Newmarket Street, Orchard Street, Foyle Street, Foyle Embankment, City Hotel Roundabout , Strand Road, Waterloo Place and Custom House Street.

More than  years ago, a commitment was made to take action to promote and protect the Irish language in the Good Friday Agreement. This was reaffirmed in the  St Andrews Agreement, Language legislation was also promised in the New Decade New Approach deal in January  but the fact an Irish Language Act has still not been implemented gives grounds, according to Mr Delargy, for the Secretary of State to intervene. He said: “Sinn Feacutein backAn Dream Dearg’s call on the British Secretary of State to live up to his commitments to legislate for an Acht Gaeilge. “The British Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said at the end of October that he would introduce the legislation. “Irish Language legislation is crucial to delivering genuine recognition to the equal rights and status of an ever-growing community of Gaeilgeoiriacute across our island. “Acht Gaeilge is long overdue. There can be no more delays and the British government should get on with implementing its commitments.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Neighbours on Racecourse Drive come together to become the brightest street in the city and raise charity fundsDerry NewsMay your Christmas be Derry and bright overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Neighbours on Racecourse Drive come together to become the brightest street in the city and raise charity fundsDerry NewsMay your Christmas be Derry and bright overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Pic by Mark Doherty.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Johnny McGarveys face was a picture of dejection after his sides intermediate final loss to Banagher at the weekend. googletag.cmd.push As the players trudged off the field to the sound of Banagher cheers, the Lavey manager lamented the games missed opportunities. “Im gutted. We didnt play well enough. “At half time wed ten wides and two, maybe three in the goalies hand,” he said. “You have to be trying to get to  points, and you maybe bring that down to  or  at this time of year with the conditions, but Banagher took their chances and were clinical on the day.” A mammoth defensive effort from the newly-crowned champions restricted Erins Own to just three scores from play, with one coming from half time substitute Ryan McGill. McGill and Cailean OBoyle had entered the fray after the break to try and turn the game, and did have some effect, but again chances were spurned. “We missed a good chance five or six minutes into the second half to go level, which was crucial, and then two - yard ones after that,” said McGarvey. “Realistically though, you shouldnt lose a hurling match by conceding  points. If you concede that you should be winning, and thats very disappointing. “Momentum is a big thing and it just seemed every time we were getting it, we made a mistake. Ryan Mulholland had a great goal chance with five minutes left and mishit the ball. “Then we had the shot at the finish that we thought was in the net. “Its bitterly disappointing but fair play to Banagher.” Between Laveys semi final win over Ballinascreen and Sundays final, the club have had three football fixtures one senior semi final and a reserve semi final and final. In contrast, Banagher have had a clear run, and McGarvey described the situation as frustrating. “I think it had an effect on the build-up. “Since we beat Ballinascreen, weve had to deal with three football matches,” he said. “Thats a week lost in training for every player, because theyre all on the football . “Thats not an excuse, its a reality. “Were a dual club and we all want to be successful and push on in both codes. “This final should have been played two weeks ago. “I dont knowit had much of an effect, but eight players played here the other night and its hard to do. “Its frustrating that we lost, but its not an excuse. “Banagher won the match fair and square and weve no issue with that whatsoever.”  Banagher edge out Lavey to claim Derry intermediate title  St Marys survived a late scare to claim a narrow victory.    PREVIEW: A battle in prospect in intermediate hurling decider  Lavey take on Banagher on Sunday afternoon at Owenbeg.    McGill goal settles topsy-turvy senior reserve final  Lavey ended a -year wait for the senior reserve championship title.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War .

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Work started last week on the new facility which is being provided at the grounds of the local gaelic club.The scheme is a joint initiative by the Saul club and Down Council and work is expected to be completed within the new few weeks.The arrival of the contractors on site late Thursday morning marked the end of a long campaign by local councillor Mr Peter Craig.He is delighted work is underway and has no doubt the playground will make a major contribution to the lives of young people in the area.He said the gaelic clubrsquos premises are being used to house the playground because no other suitable sites could be identied in the area.And in a bid to further improve safety standards, Roads Service officials are to provide new lighting along a footpath which runs from Raholp to the GAA pitch.BALLYNAHINCH mdashA senior police officer has rejected claims from a Sinn Fein councillor that a police car sped away from a Catholic couple who had been attacked in Ballynahinch at the weekend.Inspector Paul McClean has refuted Francis Brannfrsquos allegations that police allowed the assailants to escape after attacking the couple in fast food premises at High Street in the early hours of Sunday.Inspector McClean has also rejected Cllr Brannfrsquos allegations that the injured couple were questioned by an officer from a mobile support unit while their attackers were ldquoallowed to escape.Alleging that the Catholic couple were ldquoviciously beaten, Mr Brannf said that after being head butted and ldquobeaten to the ground the woman ran to a nearby police car to get help while her husband was being assaulted.He also said police allowed ldquothe Loyalists to escape the scene of yet another sectarian attack on nationalists in Ballynahinch.NEWCASTLE mdash Two Stormont departments are at loggerheads after Newcastle beach failed a series of water quality tests.Department of the Environment experts failed Newcastle beach because the level of sewage contamination found in the bathing waters was a breach of European guidelines.But the Department of Regional Development, responsible for sewage treatment, has rejected the DoErsquos reasons, claiming other factors are to blame.Only three out of  Northern Ireland beaches failed the quality tests which must be passedbeaches are to be considered for the prestigious Blue Flag quality award. Tyrella passed the stringent tests for the seventh successive year.Announcing the disappointing news for Newcastle, Environment Minister, Sam Foster, said the failure of the three beaches was due to sewage dischargers, which he added highlights the problems caused by the lack of investment in sewerage services.However, the Water Service yesterday stressed that it was unlikely the discovery was due to the failure of the multi-million pound sewage treatment plant which was built at the townrsquos harbour in the s.A Water Service spokesman said there has been no failure at the sewage plant since  and it is therefore questionable that it is the source of the problem.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Development Association will be unveiling its latest regeneration scheme at the end of the month.The official ceremony will be performed by former Down councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, who will be joined by a number of people from the town and representatives from the International Fund for Ireland.Work on the High Street project started in January and was completed in September and has transformed the area, with the ambitious pound, project including four ground floor shops, two first floor apartments and a cottage.The cottage has recently been sold and the four retail units are currently available for rental with Association officials confident they can secure tenants.Construction work began at the start of the year and the project team behind the scheme are confident the scheme will greatly enhance this area of Killyleagh which is close to the townrsquos historic castle.CASTLWELLAN mdash Elderly people in Castlwellan are being disturbed by children running through their gardens, according to the local SDLP branch.During a recent meeting of the Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, the chairman, John Duggan, said he was concerned that some older residents were being bothered by a number of young people.Mr Duggan pointed out that Castlewellan was an excellent place to live but said there was an absolute need for children to pay courtesy to their elders within the neighbourhood.ldquoWhat makes a good community spirit is the ability to have respect for others within the community. There have been some episodes recently where children have been running through gardens and hedges at homes of elderly people.ldquoI would ask them to give these members of the community the peace and space they deserve and consider their feelings in pursuit of fun, he said.BALLYKINLAR mdash Ballykinlar cross-community playgroup has been strongly praised by education inspectors for providing a positive ethos which promotes childrenrsquos confidence and self-esteem.The Department of Education report lists a number of strengths of the playgroup which operates out of the old school on the Carricknab Road.Staff are headily praised for their leadership and dedication to the children and the inspectors found there were only a few areas which need attention.ldquoThe staff treat the children with care and respect and provide a secure, supportive environment which helps the children grow in confidence and independence, said the report.SAINTFIELD mdash The achievements and success of the younger pupils at Saintfield High School were cerebrated during a special junior school prize day last week.The principal, Mr Robert Miss, said the school prided itself on being a family school offering support, interest and encouragement in all the pupils strive to achieve.Mr Mills proudly pointed out that the schoolrsquos well established year eight induction programme seeks to ensure that all new pupils entering Saintfield High School settle quickly into their new environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_stpatrickday.jpg","title":"Green light for St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"A ST Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is scheduled to go ahead next year.The Recorder can confirm that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is pressing ahead with plans for the event which regularly attracts thousands of visitors to the town.The cross-community spectacular was last held in , with last yearrsquos event one of the districtrsquos first high profile casualties of the emerging coronavirus pandemic.The parade was cancelled due to lockdown restrictions to help prevent the spread of the deadly virus, but council officials are confident the event can go ahead next March.With Covid restrictions now eased, they are keen to see the  parade take place with details surprisingly unveiled to councillors in private during Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.As the public health emergency has eased slightly, a number of councillors believe that as the parade is an outdoor event, it will be able to proceed, provided people continue to exercise caution.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, said while there are over four months to go before the parade would be held, ious plans have to be put in place.He said decisions have to be taken now to ensure that all the pieces in the eventrsquos jigsaw are in place and believes that the current environment allows for the popular event to proceed.ldquoPublic health advice rightly prompted the decision to cancel the last two St Patrickrsquos Day parades but the situation has changed. The fact that this will be an outdoor event is also an important factor in deciding that it can proceed, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe virus is still in circulation, but a signicant number of people have been vaccinated and things are certainly a lot dferent compared to last year. Protecting peoplersquos health remains important and we should all continue to wear a mask when required to do, exercise good hand hygiene and maintain our distance from others.Cllr Curran said the past  months had been some of the most dficult people across the district haf ever faced, suggesting news that the St Patrickrsquos Day is due to proceed will provide them with a glimmer of hope for the future.ldquoThere have been many large outdoor events over recent months and normality is slowly to starting to , but there is no room for complacency and we must all continue adhering to the public safety message, he continued.ldquoThe St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is hugely popular and people who regularly attend it now have something to look forward to.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in .. It is fair to say she looked right at home and will likely make further improvement now that she knows the drill.Nuala Taylor, coaxed into racing by her husband John, who wanted her to know how much he had suffered at Comber, couldnrsquot see what the fuss was about as she flew round in . .Wayne Giles gets a bit of teasing for being in the ladiesrsquo race due to being over  but he takes it in good part.He has even volunteered to shave his legs to help him blend in for the team photo.

She placed st in ..Alison Carroll in contrast said that this was possibly her most enjoyable cross country race ever and she was well pleased with her time of ..Sam Anderson, going from marathon distance to this shorter effort, was afraid of being last but she was far from it and has even signed up for the next event in two weeks time. Her time of . earned her th slot.With the ladies done and dusted, the men swarmed to the start area. There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes.

Eamon was th , John thand Patrick th in ..With banana bread and chocolate on hand to revive them, the mood at the finish line was buoyant and the whole EDAC contingent went home satisfied with having made good use of the day.The Born  Run team are excited to be back in business after the long layoff during the pandemic.They welcomed back the runners with open arms to the first event of six in the lsquoWinter Run Forest Runrsquo series, namely the Minnowburn K and K. Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast. Rachel finished th in a time of .. A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -.

Decisions that nobody wants to be taking it this time of the year, of course.“We all understand the value of Christmas, particularly in this country.“To me, those are responsible decisions now that people are making.”Dr Holohan said the same reasoning should apply to office Christmas parties.Turkey with side itemsHe told RTE News at One: “An organisation, looking at itself and looking at the kinds of measures that it now needs to take, when we’re advising people to stay at home as much as possible and work from home, those would be responsible decisions,they were to be taken.”The CMO said he understood this was dficult for people to hear, but warned that Nphet modelling projects there could be more than , cases of Covid- next month.“What we’re trying to prevent is potentially , – maybe double that – people over the course of the month of December picking up this infection,” he said.“I stress, none of those people are infected yet.“If we have , people infected in December, , of them will end up in hospital at Christmas.“We will see , people being asked to self-isolate over the Christmas period, where they can’t meet up with or shouldn’t meet up with friends, family or anybody  that are important to them.“These are huge impacts that will be placed on the population at this time of the year,we don’t find it within ourselves to improve our collective adherence.“And so, taking those measures around workplaces, to my mind would be very simple measures to cut down discretionary social contact.”Education Minister Norma Foley urged parents not to organise birthday parties or play dates for their children in the coming weeks.She said the chief medical officer had said “very clearly that we need to minimise our social interactions”.She added: “We have seen theto play dates and birthday parties and things like that.“I think there’s a call now that we would minimiseand we would draw down again and revert to what we have done in the past.”Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has confirmed antigen testing will not be free, saying the Government is planning to subsidise the cost.A single test usually costs around eight euro, which Mr Donnelly admitted is not affordable for everyone as people will be expected to take multiple tests.The Government has announced fresh measures to address a worrying rise in Covid- cases, which has left Ireland’s health system under severe pressure heading into the winter.They include more general use of antigen testing, particularly for people who socialise more often.Earlier this year, the Government’s chief scientic adviser Professor Mark Ferguson published a report in which he recommended the introduction of rapid tests.Mr Donnelly defended the speed of the Government’s response to the report, saying thousands of tests are sent to people who are deemed close contacts, higher education settings, nursing homes and childcare settings.He told RTE Morning Ireland: “One of the things we’re doing right now, we’re just finalising it, is reducing the price. So there’ll be subsidised tests available, but I think we have to go further than that.“We need very clear communications for people on how to use them because they do have a role to play.“They’ve an important role to play. There’s no silver bullet, be it boosters or antigen testing or anything.”He said the final details on subsidising the antigen tests will be worked out soon.“It’s not going to be cheap to do,” he said. “The initial figures I have are that it could be several hundred million euro.“The advice I have is that they shouldn’t be free. They had them free in the UK and the government came under huge criticism from Parliament for that because essentially there were no controls on how they were being used at all.“They’re very, very expensive. So every time you subsidise an antigen test, it’s money you’re not spending on a nurse, you’re not spending on a doctor.”The Government on Tuesday agreed that pubs, nightclubs and restaurants in Ireland will have a midnight closing time from Thursday. Residents of hotels will be exempt.People will also be urged to work from home from Friday,they can.Mr Donnelly said there are no plans to extend any of the financial measures, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment .He also said further restrictions cannot be ruled out.AskedIreland is heading for another lockdown, Mr Donnelly said no-one could answer that question.The Fianna Fail minister said the impact of the new restrictions is expected to take effect in three weeks.Stephen DonnellyGovernment  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularCall to have SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly removed from Policing BoardTunnels could be opened under Northern Ireland town‘There was Irish state collusion with IRA in my dad’s murder - now I want truth and justice,’ says Northern Ireland manMandatory vaccine passports to be introduced to Northern IrelandBBC colleagues’ tributes to former presenter Donna TraynorMost PopularTUV and UUP at odds over DUP Stormont threat as meetings with Lord Frost loomLord Frost says UK Government ‘will have the best interests of everybody in Northern Ireland, everybody in this country at heart’NI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received itThe Catholic community is striding towards a New Ireland to promote their history and their culture, we Protestants have no vision and no destination Danny Kennedy: Pulling down Stormont would be another huge mistake by unionism                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It’s kind of inevitable.“What’s interesting in the Irish situation is that it’s become quite dramatic in the last week or two.“But it’s not so bad that I’m in a position of saying ‘oh terrible, terrible’.“You’ve got these surges coming up, you’ve got health services quite stretched, but the feeling is that the Government has a pretty clear idea of what’s going on, and that there will have to be perhaps some restrictions on what people do.“But I don’t get a feel that you’re heading into stringent lockdowns again, I very much hope that won’t happen.”The Covid incidence rate in Ireland has soared to , cases per , people each week.Dr Nabarro told RTE’s Today with Claire Byrne that while some restrictions will be needed, he believes “it won’t be necessary to go into a complete lockdown”.He said that while the incidence rate is high, measures can be taken to avoid a full lockdown, which should only be used as a “last resort”.“What one needs to do is to really dissect very carefully to find out where is the virus being transmitted, in which age groups, as well as in which occupational groups and locations,” he said.“Once we’ve got a bit of an understanding about where transmission is occurring,to work with the communities that are most at risk and see whether there are ways of reducing transmission at that community level.“Then, to try to avoid going for a whole county or a whole country, stay at home, type lockdown.“The reason is thatwe have to go to lockdown, it absolutely has to be the last resort.“Lockdowns cause all sorts of other challenges in terms of how people feel when they’re confined at home.“Also, poorer people really tend to fare badly in lockdowns, because they can’t get the work they need, especiallythey’re in the informal economy.“So, let’s try to keep the numbers coming down without the full lockdown.”Dr Nabarro praised Ireland’s public health officials and said they were capable of introducing measures that would avoid the need for lockdown.He said: “The reason why I say I think that’s possible in Ireland is that I’m really confident that the public health people are able to work out what might be the most appropriate restrictions.“If things get really bad, yeah, they’ll have to go back into lockdown.“I’m just hopeful on the basis of what I’m reading now, that this this should not be possible, especially because of acting now and acting quite quickly.”IrelandStephen DonnellyCovid-Government  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularCall to have SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly removed from Policing BoardTunnels could be opened under Northern Ireland town‘There was Irish state collusion with IRA in my dad’s murder -

If the evidence supports third doses for people in those younger age groups, then the JCVI will make another announcement.Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said today that \"most younger adults will have received their second dose in late summer or early autumn\", meaning they will \"still have a high level of protection\" against coronavirus.Vaccines for teenagersWales will also begin offering second vaccine doses to people aged  and  who are not in an at-risk group.That second dose should be given  weeks after the first jab, the JCVI said, and for any young people who have been infected with Covid-since receiving their first dose, the second jab should be given at least  weeks after they were infected..removeMs Morgan said the JCVIfound that a second dose offered \"more durable protection against Covid- and further reduced the risk of infection and serious illness\".This was \"balanced against data showing the rare incidence of adverse events following vaccination in young people\".The health minister said the Welsh Governemnt would now work with the NHS on both new recommendations before the new vaccine policies are implemented in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A motion to ban MPs from holding second jobs outside parliament as paid lobbyists or political consultants has failed. MPs voted by a majority of  votes to reject the motion which had been put forward by the Labour Party following the recent Tory sleaze row and the government’s handling of the Owen Paterson case. Boris Johnson had instructed his MPs to vote against the Labour motion, with a following Conservative amendment passing through a majority of  votes. Labour leader Keir Starmer announced that the party would be tabling a motion to call for a ban on MPs being able to hold “any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant”. It came after huge backlash over the Owen Paterson row and the accusation that the Conservative government had ed to a policy of “sleaze”. Johnson had previously instructed Tory MPs to vote against the immediate suspension of former MP Owen Paterson, who had been found by the parliamentary standards committee to have broken lobbying rules while working as a consultant and earning £, per year. The committee had recommended that Paterson serve a -day suspension, however his suspension was initially blocked after a vote in the House of Commons, where a reform of the parliamentary standards committee was also voted through. The government was forced to do a hard u-turn on blocking Paterson’s suspension following intense backlash from opposition parties and the public, with critics claiming that the incident had heralded ato “Tory sleaze”. As a result of the incident, Labour took the opportunity to table a motion which banned the paid employment of MPs in positions consultancy and advisory role outside of parliament. At a vote in the House of Commons on  November, the motion was rejected by  votes to . Despite rejecting the motion with a majority of  votes, the vote showed that Boris Johnson’s majority on the issue had decreased. Many Tory MPs abstained from voting against the controversial motion, while four Conservative MPs - Peter bone, Philip Hollobone, Nigel Mills and Dan Poulter - rebelled against the party and voted in favour of the ban on certain kinds of second jobs. Upon the announcement that a Labour backed motion calling for a ban on paid lobbying and consultancy role for MP would be tabled, Johnson tabled an amendment. The amendment described the ban as “the basis of a viable approach” and called on the Standards Committee to update the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Labour called the motion a “watered down” version of the original amendment. Despite the original motion being rejected, the amendment passed with  votes to zero, with Labour MPs abstaining from the second vote. A Government spokesperson said: “The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.“This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.“This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.”Following the vote and rejection of the Labour motion, Starmer said: “We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics.“Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesn’t get.”“We are not going to back down from these proposals, we’re not prepared to have them watered down, so we will press on with them.“But it is unbelievable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"junior reporter needed to interview the fureys ","story":"Jake Bailey-Sloan: Tributes to young Portadown businessman ‘one of the kindest souls you could ever meet’   Appeal after assault on traffic wardenNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleJunior reporter needed to interview The FureysWe’re on the lookout for a junior reporter interested in the unique assignment of interviewing members of top Irish folk band, The Fureys.By Valerie MartinMonday, th November , : am  \"       \"  The Fureys, will be performing at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Saturday, January  and in advance of this showpiece event, we are giving one young person a unique opportunity to interview Eddie and George Furey from the band.The interview will take place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday, December .

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cadbcbdeefe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbdee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
